  "text": "While it can take years for the pharmaceutical industry to create medicines capable of treating or curing human disease, a new study suggests that using generative artificial intelligence could vastly accelerate the drug-development process.          Today, most drug discovery is carried out by human chemists who rely on their knowledge and experience to select and synthesize the right molecules needed to become the safe and efficient medicines we depend on. To identify the synthesis paths, scientists often employ a technique called retrosynthesis\u2014a method for creating potential drugs by working backward from the wanted molecules and searching for chemical reactions to make them.Yet because sifting through millions of potential chemical reactions can be an extremely challenging and time-consuming endeavor, researchers at The Ohio State University have created an AI framework called G2Retro to automatically generate reactions for any given molecule. The new study showed that compared to current manual-planning methods, the framework was able to cover an enormous range of possible chemical reactions as well as accurately and quickly discern which reactions might work best to create a given drug molecule.\"Using AI for things critical to saving human lives, such as medicine, is what we really want to focus on,\" said Xia Ning, lead author of the study and an associate professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State. \"Our aim was to use AI to accelerate the drug design process, and we found that it not only saves researchers time and money but provides drug candidates that may have much better properties than any molecules that exist in nature.\"This study builds on previous research of Ning's where her team developed a method named Modof that was able to generate molecule structures that exhibited desired properties better than any existing molecules. \"Now the question becomes how to make such generated molecules, and that is where this new study shines,\" said Ning, also an associate professor of biomedical informatics in the College of Medicine.The study was published today in the journal Communications Chemistry.Ning's team trained G2Retro on a dataset that contains 40,000 chemical reactions collected between 1976 and 2016. The framework \"learns\" from graph-based representations of given molecules, and uses deep neural networks to generate possible reactant structures that could be used to synthesize them. Its generative power is so impressive that, according to Ning, once given a molecule, G2Retro could come up with hundreds of new reaction predictions in only a few minutes.\"Our generative AI method G2Retro is able to supply multiple different synthesis routes and options, as well as a way to rank different options for each molecule,\" said Ning. \"This is not going to replace current lab-based experiments, but it will offer more and better drug options so experiments can be prioritized and focused much faster.\"To further test the AI's effectiveness, Ning's team conducted a case study to see if G2Retro could accurately predict four newly released drugs already in circulation: Mitapivat, a medication used to treat hemolytic anemia; Tapinarof, which is used to treat various skin diseases; Mavacamten, a drug to treat systemic heart failure; and Oteseconazole, used to treat fungal infections in females. G2Retro was able to correctly generate exactly the same patented synthesis routes for these medicines, and provided alternative synthesis routes that are also feasible and synthetically useful, Ning said.Having such a dynamic and effective device at scientists' disposal could enable the industry to manufacture stronger drugs at a quicker pace\u2014but despite the edge AI might give scientists inside the lab, Ning emphasizes the medicines G2Retro or any generative AI creates still need to be validated\u2014a process that involves the created molecules being tested in animal models and later in human trials.\"We are very excited about generative AI for medicine, and we are dedicated to using AI responsibly to improve human health,\" said Ning.

  "question_squad": " What is the largest drug target class encoded by the human genome?",
  "answer_squad": " GPCRs",
  "text": "An international study led by Monash University has, for the first time, harnessed cutting-edge technology to reveal new and unprecedented information of how a special class of drugs, known as \"allosteric modulators\" work at the M4 muscarinic receptor, a major target for notoriously difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive deficits, such as schizophrenia.          Muscarinic receptors are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)\u2014the largest drug target class encoded by the human genome. The M4 muscarinic receptor subtype, in particular, plays a vital role in regulating neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and glutamate, in key areas of the brain involved in psychosis and cognition, but, until recently, was notoriously difficult to selectively target by conventional agonists or antagonists.This challenge has begun to be addressed in recent years with the discovery of highly selective allosteric modulators for this receptor, but how such drugs achieve their selectivity and regulate M4 receptor activity in response to different activators has remained a major, elusive, knowledge gap, despite high clinical implications.The new study, published in eLife, and led by a team of researchers from the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (MIPS), has now addressed this important gap in our molecular-level understanding of how allosteric modulators mediate their effects at the M4 muscarinic receptor.In this study, the MIPS researchers (who are world-leaders in the discovery and development of next-generation neuromedicines, including allosteric modulators, for difficult-to-treat mental illnesses), rigorously quantified the pharmacological properties of two distinct 'positive' allosteric modulators, alone or in combination with two different agonists, at the human M4 muscarinic receptor.The team also tapped into technological advancements in the fields of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics simulations to unlock first-of-its-kind evidence of key molecular mechanisms underlying allosteric pharmacology, advancing our understanding of the structural basis of allosteric modulation of the M4 muscarinic receptor and paving the way for the discovery and design of future allosteric drugs.      In particular, the researchers revealed a vital role for ligand\u2013receptor\u2013G protein complex stability, mediated by conformational dynamics between these sites, in the ultimate determination of affinity, efficacy, degree of allosteric modulation, and mechanisms underlying species variability of allosteric drugs, all of which have significant implications for preclinical-to-clinical discovery and translation of such agents.Corresponding author, and MIPS Senior Research Fellow, Dr. David Thal, said that allosteric modulation of GPCRs is a major paradigm in drug discovery; however, despite decades of research, a molecular-level understanding of the general principles that govern the myriad pharmacological effects exerted by GPCR allosteric modulators has remained elusive.\"By determining the cryo-EM structures of the M4 muscarinic receptor and applying molecular dynamics simulations, the team has provided a holistic framework for further GPCR mechanistic studies and, in turn, opened up new approaches for GPCR drug discovery,\" said Dr. Thal.Professor Arthur Christopoulos, FAA FAHMS, also a corresponding author on the study, Dean of the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Director of Monash's Neuromedicines Discovery Centre, said the results have broader implications for the development of new allosteric medicines designed to reduce currently untreated symptoms associated with schizophrenia and cognitive disorders.\"The vast majority of patients with schizophrenia have impaired cognition, which is untreated by any existing antipsychotic drug, and its severity remains a major predictor of prognosis. However the development of new safe and effective treatments has remained stagnant for decades,\" said Professor Christopoulos.\"The research conducted in this study is a vital step toward progressing the next generation of medical therapies and innovations that could make a true impact when it comes to improving health and saving lives.\"Dr. Celine Valant, also a corresponding author and Senior Research Fellow at MIPS, said the findings open up exciting new opportunities.\"The evidence presented in this study will enable future GPCR drug discovery research and potentially lead to the development of next generation medicines for the treatment of a range of psychiatric and cognitive disorders,\" said Dr. Valant.

  "text": "Proteins are biological molecules that perform almost all biochemical tasks in all forms of life. In doing so, the tiny structures perform ultra-fast movements. In order to investigate these dynamic processes more precisely than before, researchers have developed a new algorithm that can be used to evaluate measurements at X-ray free-electron lasers such as the SwissFEL more efficiently. They have now presented it in the journal Structural Dynamics.          Sometimes, when using the navigation system while traveling by car, the device will locate you off the road for a short time. This is due to the inaccuracy of the GPS positioning, which can be as much as several meters. However, the algorithm in the sat nav will soon notice this and correct the trajectory displayed on the screen, i.e. put it back on the road.A comparable principle for addressing unrealistic motion sequences has now been successfully applied by a team of researchers led by PSI physicist Cecilia Casadei. However, their objects of investigation are about a billion times smaller than a car: proteins. These building blocks of life fulfill crucial functions in all known organisms. In doing so, they often perform ultra-fast movements. Analyzing these movements precisely is crucial for our understanding of proteins which can help us produce new medical agents, among other things.How to 'film' proteinsTo further improve the understanding of protein movements, Casadei, together with other PSI researchers, a researcher at DESY in Hamburg and other colleagues at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, U.S., has developed an algorithm that evaluates data obtained in experiments at an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). An XFEL is a large-scale research facility that delivers extremely intense and short flashes of laser-quality X-ray light. Here, a method called time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (TR-SFX) can be used to study the ultra-fast movements of proteins.Credit: Paul Scherrer InstituteThe measurements are very complex for several reasons: the proteins are much too small to be imaged directly, their movements are incredibly fast, and the intense pulse of X-ray light of an FEL completely destroys the proteins. On the experimental level, TR-SFX already solves all these problems: no individual molecule is measured, but rather a large number of identical protein molecules are induced to grow together in a regular arrangement to form protein crystals.When the FEL X-ray light shines on these crystals, the information is captured in time before the crystals and their proteins are destroyed by the pulse of light. The raw data from the measurements are available as so-called diffraction images: light spots that are created by the regular arrangement of the proteins in the crystal and registered by a detector.      How to evaluate the measurement dataWhere the experimental challenges have been overcome, the evaluation of the data is just beginning. \"The measurement of each individual crystal provides only two percent of the data of a complete image.\" This incompleteness has physical and experimental reasons and can only be eliminated by combining the measurement data of many crystals in a meaningful way. Casadei's research focuses on exactly how to go about this.The method established so far is called \"binning and merging\".\"A lot has been achieved with this method in the last decade,\" says Casadei. With this method, the data are divided into time intervals and all data within one interval, a 'bin,' are averaged. However, a lot of detailed information is also lost in this averaging. \"You could say that the individual images of the protein film are then all a bit washed out,\" Casadei continues. \"That's why we have developed a method that allows us to get more out of the measurement data.\"The new method devised by Casadei and her colleagues is called \"low-pass spectral analysis\", or LPSA for short. \"Similar to electronics or audio technology, we apply a low-pass filter,\" Casadei explains. \"However, in our case it comes in the form of advanced linear algebra. We apply these formulas to remove unwanted noise from the data without losing the relevant details.\"In short and simple terms, the raw data, i.e. the diffraction images of the protein crystals, are tracked throughout the protein motion. This movement is assumed to be smooth, i.e. jerk-free. Similar to how the navigation system corrects itself when the car seemingly leaves the course of the road, the new algorithm by Casadei and her colleagues mitigates errors of the protein movement reconstruction.HDR for protein filmsLay people may not notice an immense difference in the new protein films. But for the cineastes at X-ray free-electron lasers, the improvement is comparable to switching from a DVD film to HDR quality.\"Above all, the new algorithm now allows researchers here at SwissFEL at PSI to extract more information from their data,\" says Casadei. Conversely, this means the algorithm can help shorten long measurement times. Since beam time is always in high demand at large-scale research facilities, and in particular at SwissFEL, this is a most welcome prospect for protein researchers using this highly advanced facility.

  "answer_race": " Supercooled water can be studied.",
  "question_squad": " What is the temperature range of water known as?",
  "answer_squad": " no man's land",
  "text": "Researchers at EPFL have found a way to study water in \"no man's land,\" a subzero temperature range where water crystallizes rapidly. Historically, the inability to access \"no man's land\" has prevented scientists from unriddling the anomalous nature of water, but the breakthrough method can now change that.          Water is one of the most essential and widespread compounds on Earth. Covering over 70% of the planet's surface, it has shaped its composition and geology, it regulates its climate and weather patterns, and is at the foundation of all life as we know it.But water is also weird. It exhibits a number of anomalous properties, of which scientists have identified over seventy\u2014so far. Several theories try to explain these anomalies, but verifying them experimentally is difficult. One of the reasons is that this would require studying water between 160 K and 232 K (-113 \u00b0C to -41 \u00b0C), a notorious temperature range known as \"no man's land\" where water crystallizes so fast that it has been impossible for scientists to study its properties.But why would anyone want to cool water to such low temperatures? Because when water is cooled way below its freezing point it becomes 'supercooled' with unique and fascinating properties; for example, under certain conditions it can remain in liquid form but can freeze instantly when disturbed or exposed to certain substances. Supercooled water is obtained by taking liquid water and cooling it below the freezing point while using tricks to prevent it from crystallizing or at least slowing this process down. However, even with these tricks, crystallization in 'no man's land' is still too fast.\"An experiment to systematically probe the structure of water across so-called 'no man's land' has remained elusive for decades,\" says Professor Ulrich Lorenz at EPFL's School of Basic Sciences. Now, scientists led by Lorenz have found a way to do just that. The team developed a way to rapidly prepare deeply supercooled water at a well-defined temperature and probe it with electron diffraction before it can crystallize.\"We have still not fully understood why water is an anomalous liquid, despite this topic being hotly debated for over forty years,\" says Lorenz. \"The answer appears to lie in 'no man's land.\" But because of fast crystallization, any measurement over the full temperature range has not been possible. We do this for the first time. This brings us closer to solving this long-standing mystery.\"The scientists performed the experiments with a specialized time-resolved electron microscope they custom built in their lab. They prepared the supercooled water at a well-defined temperature and probed it directly before crystallization occurred. To do this, they cooled a layer of graphene to 101 K and deposited a thin film of amorphous ice. They then locally melted the film with a microsecond laser pulse to obtain water in 'no man's land,\" and captured a diffraction pattern with an intense, high-brightness electron pulse.The researchers found that as water is cooled from room temperature to cryogenic temperatures, its structure evolves smoothly. At temperatures just below 200 K (about -73 \u00b0C), the structure of water begins to look like that of amorphous ice\u2014a form of ice where water molecules are in a disordered state\u2014unlike the tidy crystalline ice we are usually familiar with.\"The fact that the structure evolves smoothly allows us to narrow down the range of possible explanations for the origin of water anomalies,\" says Lorenz. \"Our findings and the method we have developed bring us closer to unriddling the mysteries of water. It is difficult to escape the fascination of this ubiquitous and seemingly simple liquid that still has not given up all of its secrets.\"The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.

  "text": "A study by Loughborough University and the University of Oxford has led to the development of a small molecule probe that could deepen our understanding of a crucial cellular messenger and lead to the development of new therapeutic drugs.          The research paper\u2014recently highlighted as Pick of the Week in the journal, Chemical Science\u2014showcases the researchers' innovative probe that binds to inositol pyrophosphate or '5-PP-InsP5\".5-PP-InsP5 plays a fundamental role in various biological processes, including cell growth, programmed cell death, and enzyme regulation, and new roles are still emerging with it recently being found to be a key regulator of blood glucose levels.Due to its diverse roles in cellular processes, 5-PP-InsP5 is an attractive target for developing therapeutic drugs.However, biomedical and drug discovery research relies on 'small molecule probes' to detect specific target molecules and, until now, no 5-PP-InsP5-specific probes existed.The Loughborough University and University of Oxford research team\u2014which includes Dr. Stephen Butler, Dr. Felix Plasser, and Professor Barry Potter\u2014combined their chemical synthetic and computational modeling expertise to create a probe specific to 5-PP-InsP5 that emits a bright red light upon binding.The intensity and duration of this light can be measured to quantify the levels of 5-PP-InsP5 during different biological processes, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its precise functions, mechanisms, and therapeutic potential.Of the importance of the research, Dr. Stephen Butler commented, \"A key motivation in our lab is to develop molecular tools with real-world applications, so we're excited about the potential of the probe reported here as a drug discovery tool, that could enable high-throughput screening of drug-like molecules that modulate biological processes involving the cellular messenger 5-PP-InsP5.\"Other inositol pyrophosphates exist and are still emerging in biology, so methods to detect, synthesize and exploit these could also be necessary and will be facilitated by the probe design features established in this project.\"Professor Barry Potter, of the University of Oxford, added, \"I have spent almost all of my independent scientific career in research on inositol phosphates and feel that the advent of these new pyrophosphate messengers, with their emerging biological functions, is truly exciting for the field and calls for innovation.\"Our highly collaborative new paper presents a very timely technique to measure such a messenger for the first time and should enable a wealth of further developments in the area.\"The co-lead authors of the study are Megan Shipton and Fathima Jamion, a Ph.D. and final year undergraduate student from Oxford and Loughborough, respectively.Megan and Fathima said of their achievement in a joint statement: \"We are delighted to work as part of this collaborative team to take some vital steps in helping further uncover the biological roles of 5-PP-InsP5.\"It's especially rewarding to see our combined work published in a top chemistry journal and we look forward to seeing how it fuels future research in this area.\"The research paper, titled \"Expedient synthesis and luminescence sensing of the inositol pyrophosphate cellular messenger 5-PP-InsP5,\" is Chemical Science.

  "text": "A study led by researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory could uncover new ways to produce more powerful, longer-lasting batteries and memory devices.          The research examines the causes behind the ordering, or pattern formation, of ions that carry a positive charge, also called cations, in double perovskite oxides, a type of metal considered promising as a potential source of cleaner, more sustainable energy for its magnetism and ability to conduct electricity. The paper, titled \"Insights into Cation Ordering of Double Perovskite Oxides from Machine Learning and Causal Relations,\" is published in Chemistry of Materials.\"If we can understand the fundamental mechanism behind these properties, then we could attempt to grow or otherwise create these perovskite materials for such applications as batteries, memory devices and capacitors,\" said Ayana Ghosh, an ORNL research scientist and the study's lead author. \"We've developed a formula from this study that we'll give to the rest of the world.\"Ghosh and researchers from the SRM Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai, India, sought to determine how the patterns formed by cations affect stability in double perovskites. The more stable the material, the better suited it is for potential energy applications.\"This cation ordering can be affected by a number of variables,\" Ghosh said. \"Sizes of the ions matter. Distortions come into play. We wanted to know: Is there one single factor that would drive cation ordering in this kind of system? If so, what is that factor?\"The team relied on resources from two DOE Office of Science user facilities\u2014data collected at ORNL's Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences and time on the Cori supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center\u2014to develop a new computational framework. The system combined causal analysis and traditional machine learning with density functional theory, which estimates materials' electronic and atomic structures. Researchers trained the algorithm on various cation types and patterns within double perovskite systems to predict conditions that lead to specific ordering of cations.The team combined the cause-and-effect relationships observed with the findings from standard predictive machine learning algorithms. Analysis of the results identified trilinear coupling, an interaction among three types of particles, as the necessary condition behind clear layered ordering\u2014one of the essential patterns of cation ordering.Trilinear coupling combines three types of structural modes that push the cations through the necessary phases to result in properties such as multiferroicity, the combination of magnetization and polarization that makes perovskites promising for energy applications.\"If you have this type of coupling, you should have the formation of clear layered ordering,\" Ghosh said. \"The ordering won't occur without it. You can think of the three modes as fundamental building blocks. This wasn't known before.\"Next steps include applying those findings to identify conditions necessary for other types of ordering to design new phases of double perovskite oxides.\"This new insight gives us a road map to go beyond what we've already known from theory,\" Ghosh said. \"Now we can explore further based on these principles.\" More information:Ayana Ghosh et al, Insights into Cation Ordering of Double Perovskite Oxides from Machine Learning and Causal Relations, Chemistry of Materials (2022).

  "text": "Researchers at Flinders University have discovered a new low-cost material that can be made into lenses for thermal imaging\u2014pointing to new advanced manufacturing applications for this powerful technology.          Thermal and infrared imaging are used in many industries including defense, security and surveillance, medicine, electrical engineering, space exploration and autonomous vehicle operation\u2014but the materials required are expensive and becoming more difficult to find.Lower cost alternatives are needed so a multi-disciplinary team in chemistry and physics at Flinders University have developed a solution in an entirely new polymer material made from sulfur and cyclopentadiene. They say the high-performance polymers have the unique ability to transmit infrared light.\"The material combines high performance, low cost and efficient manufacturing,\" says Ph.D. candidate Sam Tonkin, first author in a new article in the Advanced Optical Materials journal.\"It has the potential to expand the use of thermal imaging to new industries which were previously limited by the high cost of germanium or chalcogenide lenses. This is a rapidly developing field which will see exciting advances in the next few years,\" he says.Sulfur is produced in many millions of tons in petroleum refining. Billions of tons are available in geological deposits. It is plentiful and cheap.Cyclopentadiene is also derived from low-cost materials produced in petroleum refining.The lenses used for thermal imaging are currently made from germanium or chalcogenide glasses. Germanium is an element in short supply and it is very expensive. Some germanium lenses can costs thousands of dollars.Chalcogenide glasses also have shortcomings. For instance, they are often made of toxic elements such as arsenic or selenium.Co-author Dr. Le Nhan Pham, a Flinders University researcher in computational and physical chemistry, says reacting sulfur and cyclopentadiene together provides a black plastic with high transparency to infrared light.\"This is the light that is detected by thermal imaging cameras.\"This novel material was designed to have a wide array of potential applications from space engineering to military operation, and to civil and aerospace industries,\" he says.The polymer can be molded into a variety of lenses, which can be used, for example, to magnify the image in a thermal camera. Because the polymer is black, it can also be used to conceal and protect thermal imaging equipment. The polymer can therefore be used as camouflage to hide a camera used for surveillance.The infrared light passes through the polymer, so one can see through it using an infrared camera. This property is useful for defense operations and wildlife surveillance.The polymer also has many other features:The material has the highest long-wave infrared light transparency ever reported for a plastic.The raw materials are low cost: for a 1 g lens the building blocks cost less than 1 cent.The material allows rapid molding into various shapes such as lenses. This is a more rapid process than current lens production which relies on slow milling methods.The study also reported some key scientific advances, including a new reactor that was designed to enable the key reaction. A key challenge was to be able to use the building blocks in gaseous form. The use of gaseous monomers was previous thought not to be possible by other researchers in the area.The study also includes quantum mechanical calculations to understand how and why the material is transparent to infrared light used in thermal imaging. These insights will also be useful in the future to design new lenses with further improved properties. More information:Samuel J.

  "answer_squad": " consuming fish with elevated mercury concentrations",
  "text": "A new study at Ume\u00e5 University provides insight into how mercury transforms into its more toxic form, methylmercury, with the help of small sulfur-containing substances known as thiols.          Mercury spread in the environment is a critical issue, due to the severe effects on human health and ecosystems. The main mercury exposure for humans comes from consuming fish with elevated mercury concentrations, especially in the form of methylmercury. Most of the methylmercury in the environment is formed by specific microorganisms by transforming mercury.Mareike Gutensohn, at the Department of Chemistry at Ume\u00e5 University, has explored how small sulfur-containing substances, called thiols, influence this transformation. Thiols can be found dissolved in oxygen-free waters or within the surface of cells, as part of proteins, and they play a critical role in forming methylmercury since they can attach to mercury and affect how easily it is transformed or absorbed by microorganisms.Monitoring the environment is importantIn her thesis, she has investigated systematically the combined effect of chemical and biological factors on the formation of methylmercury and the mechanistic behind it. The study unveiled that the formation of dissolved thiols, tied to cell metabolism, leads to enhanced production of methylmercury.\"The formation of both thiols and methylmercury heavily depends on the metabolic activity of microorganisms. Interestingly, the composition and concentration of the formed thiols significantly impact the potential for methylmercury formation. This underlines the importance of monitoring the formation of thiols within the environment,\" says Mareike Gutensohn, doctoral student at the Department of Chemistry.The research also provided the first systematic characterization of the outer and inner cell membranes of the studied microorganism, with respect to thiols within the surface of the cells. For this, Mareike Gutensohn used advanced spectroscopic techniques known as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a powerful method to study cell-mercury interaction.Complex relationshipThe characterization unveiled variations in thiol concentration across the cell membrane, shedding light on the complex relationship between thiols and mercury transformation.\"While our understanding of thiols' role in methylmercury formation has significantly improved, there's still much to explore, particularly the role and implications of the differences in thiol concentration within the cell surface,\" says Mareike Gutensohn.This study advances our understanding of the complex interplay of chemical and biological factors impacting mercury's transformation into methylmercury. This breakthrough in scientific understanding helps predict and control methylmercury formation, contributing to a safer and healthier ecosystem.

  "text": "What makes for the ultimate beer drinking experience? Some like theirs in a frosty glass, others with a wedge of lime. But when it comes to froth\u2014or the head as it's commonly known\u2014what's the best amount and how can it be achieved?          Too much froth and you're left with a smear of bubbles across your face and hanging from your nose as you desperately try to get at the beer beneath. But too little will cause problems in your stomach.You see, if there's no foam the CO2 stays dissolved in the beer. If you then eat something, the foam erupts in your stomach rather than the glass, causing beer bloat. That's why tipping a glass to avoid a frothy head is a rookie error.Hoping to solve this issue, a company in Japan has designed a beer can with two pulls, which control the level of foam produced by opening the can, resulting in the perfect amount of froth.This is just the most recent development in beer technology. Humanity has been chasing the perfect pint since beer's inception, which evidence suggests was roughly 13,000 years ago near Haifa, Israel\u2014the oldest known record of human-made alcohol.Under pressureBeer consumption has evolved through the ages.Those first producers and consumers of beer in Israel were the Natufian people, a group of hunter-gatherers in the eastern Mediterranean. Their beer would have been unfiltered, which made it look like thin porridge.This led to the invention of beer straws around the fifth to the fourth millennium in Iran and Iraq, which featured a filter on the tip that held back the beer solids. These straws were similar in design to a modern bombilla (a yerba mate tea straw used for at least four centuries in South America).The next significant leap in brewing was not the glass bottle, but another airtight closure: the barrel.Advances in cooperage (the making of wooden casks and barrels) during the Middle Ages meant that the CO2 produced by yeast during fermentation remained in the solution within the container, rather than dissipating and giving it the porridge-like consistency of previous beers. This meant beer could be held and dispensed under pressure for the first time. This inexorably altered the appearance and flavor of beer, as it became effervescent and foamy when served fresh.Foam was a vital component of proper beer because it showed its freshness.A good headThe foamy head was at one time called a \"collar\"\u2014a term that first appeared in print in John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row. There seems to be no origin story attached to the moniker. And sadly, there seems less need to apply a name to beer foam since society has strayed from proper beer pouring techniques.Traditionally, beer was allowed to foam up so much as it was being poured that a \"foam scraper\" (also known as a \"foam flipper\" or \"head cutter\") was needed to shave the excess off the glass rim. A large head was achieved by pouring the beer in an upright glass and encouraging excessive foaming. This technique dissipates the trapped CO2 and brings positive flavor elements to the forefront.These days you'll notice that glasses are tipped while beer is poured. This is done to minimize foam but leads to a less pleasurable, gaseous experience instead of a creamy, toasty sip.Next time you order a pint you should ask your bartender to pour the amber stuff into an upright glass. This is all to say, don't fear the foam, it's integral to your enjoyment. Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

  "text": "In a concerted effort with collaborators from the University College London, Professor Zhengxiao Guo from the Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong (HKU), and Professor Junwang Tang, now at the Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, have jointly developed a highly active and selective catalytic material that can efficiently convert methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into formaldehyde, an essential chemical in a waste-free manner.          This innovative material, derived from tungsten trioxide (WO3 catalyst), features a dual active site comprising copper and tungsten atomic species that work in tandem to ensure an effective and selective conversion process. The conversion process can achieve nearly 100% selectivity under visible light, which avoids unwanted byproducts and increase efficiency, making it an eco-friendly alternative to current production methods. The findings have just been published in the journal Nature Communications.Change the unchanged: Methane conversionMethane, the principal component of natural gas, is a widely used carbon source for numerous chemicals. Nevertheless, it is also a potent greenhouse gas, with more than 70 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. The catalytic conversion of methane (converting methane into other chemicals), therefore, presents a tremendous opportunity for achieving net-zero energy and chemical supplies while simultaneously addressing environmental concerns.However, methane is an extremely stable molecule, making it resistant to activation, particularly under mild or ambient conditions. Thus, achieving high activity and selectivity in methane conversion is a significant challenge, and the selective activation of the intermolecular carbon-hydrogen bond is often considered by many chemists as one of the most elusive \"holy grails\" in catalysis.Formaldehyde, on the other hand, is a high-volume commodity chemical with a market value of USD 8 billion, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7%. It is used in household, commercial, aviation, medical and automotive products and serves as a valuable precursor for melamine, urea-formaldehyde and phenolic resins, among others. Formaldehyde is also safely used in the manufacture of vaccines, anti-infective drugs and hard-gel capsules. Currently, it is produced through methanol oxidation-dehydrogenation using silver or metal-oxide catalysts at high reactor temperatures of more than 500\u00b0C\u2013600\u00b0C, resulting in substantial carbon dioxide emissions and energy penalties.      Harnessing sunlight to convert methaneIn their study, the team discovers a new way of turning methane gas into formaldehyde using sunlight. They found that a mixture of atomically dispersed copper and partially reduced tungsten species over tungsten oxide worked really well\u2014the synergistic ensemble enabling exceptional photocatalytic methane conversion to formaldehyde under ambient visible light. The process exhibited nearly 100% selectivity and high conversion efficiency, significantly outperforming previously reported photocatalysts (with a turnover frequency, TOF = 8.5\u00d7106 \u03bcmol (HCHO)\u00b7g-1(cocatalyst)\u00b7h-1).Through mechanistic analysis, they figured out that the copper helped to move electrons around and create reactive molecular species while the tungsten helped to activate the methane gas. Specifically, the copper acted as electron acceptors and promoted photo-induced electron transfer from the conduction band to dioxygen, generating reactive hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO\u00b7). Meanwhile, the adjacent tungsten atom that had a partial positive charge functioned as hole acceptors. The preferred adsorption and activation site of water produced hydroxyl radicals and effectively activated methane to methyl radicals. The synergy of the adjacent dual active sites greatly enhances the overall efficiency and selectivity of the conversion process.This finding paves the way for further research and development of new photo-catalysts for a variety of chemical conversions, promoting more sustainable and efficient processes in the chemical industry.\"Solar conversion of methane is highly desirable for both low-carbon and high-value-added chemical syntheses. However, product selectivity and production efficiency are key to success. This requires an in-depth understanding of the conversion mechanism, careful design of the catalyst, and complementary techniques to confirm its performance\u2014a good case of multidisciplinary tasks that require strong collaborative dedication. That's exactly what the team has managed to do\u2014with much value-added outcome,\" said Professor Zhengxiao Guo, one of the corresponding authors of the paper.

  "text": "While it can take years for the pharmaceutical industry to create medicines capable of treating or curing human disease, a new study suggests that using generative artificial intelligence could vastly accelerate the drug-development process.          Today, most drug discovery is carried out by human chemists who rely on their knowledge and experience to select and synthesize the right molecules needed to become the safe and efficient medicines we depend on. To identify the synthesis paths, scientists often employ a technique called retrosynthesis\u2014a method for creating potential drugs by working backward from the wanted molecules and searching for chemical reactions to make them.Yet because sifting through millions of potential chemical reactions can be an extremely challenging and time-consuming endeavor, researchers at The Ohio State University have created an AI framework called G2Retro to automatically generate reactions for any given molecule. The new study showed that compared to current manual-planning methods, the framework was able to cover an enormous range of possible chemical reactions as well as accurately and quickly discern which reactions might work best to create a given drug molecule.\"Using AI for things critical to saving human lives, such as medicine, is what we really want to focus on,\" said Xia Ning, lead author of the study and an associate professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State. \"Our aim was to use AI to accelerate the drug design process, and we found that it not only saves researchers time and money but provides drug candidates that may have much better properties than any molecules that exist in nature.\"This study builds on previous research of Ning's where her team developed a method named Modof that was able to generate molecule structures that exhibited desired properties better than any existing molecules. \"Now the question becomes how to make such generated molecules, and that is where this new study shines,\" said Ning, also an associate professor of biomedical informatics in the College of Medicine.The study was published today in the journal Communications Chemistry.Ning's team trained G2Retro on a dataset that contains 40,000 chemical reactions collected between 1976 and 2016. The framework \"learns\" from graph-based representations of given molecules, and uses deep neural networks to generate possible reactant structures that could be used to synthesize them. Its generative power is so impressive that, according to Ning, once given a molecule, G2Retro could come up with hundreds of new reaction predictions in only a few minutes.\"Our generative AI method G2Retro is able to supply multiple different synthesis routes and options, as well as a way to rank different options for each molecule,\" said Ning. \"This is not going to replace current lab-based experiments, but it will offer more and better drug options so experiments can be prioritized and focused much faster.\"To further test the AI's effectiveness, Ning's team conducted a case study to see if G2Retro could accurately predict four newly released drugs already in circulation: Mitapivat, a medication used to treat hemolytic anemia; Tapinarof, which is used to treat various skin diseases; Mavacamten, a drug to treat systemic heart failure; and Oteseconazole, used to treat fungal infections in females. G2Retro was able to correctly generate exactly the same patented synthesis routes for these medicines, and provided alternative synthesis routes that are also feasible and synthetically useful, Ning said.Having such a dynamic and effective device at scientists' disposal could enable the industry to manufacture stronger drugs at a quicker pace\u2014but despite the edge AI might give scientists inside the lab, Ning emphasizes the medicines G2Retro or any generative AI creates still need to be validated\u2014a process that involves the created molecules being tested in animal models and later in human trials.\"We are very excited about generative AI for medicine, and we are dedicated to using AI responsibly to improve human health,\" said Ning.

  "answer_squad": " GPCRs",
  "text": "An international study led by Monash University has, for the first time, harnessed cutting-edge technology to reveal new and unprecedented information of how a special class of drugs, known as \"allosteric modulators\" work at the M4 muscarinic receptor, a major target for notoriously difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive deficits, such as schizophrenia.          Muscarinic receptors are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)\u2014the largest drug target class encoded by the human genome. The M4 muscarinic receptor subtype, in particular, plays a vital role in regulating neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and glutamate, in key areas of the brain involved in psychosis and cognition, but, until recently, was notoriously difficult to selectively target by conventional agonists or antagonists.This challenge has begun to be addressed in recent years with the discovery of highly selective allosteric modulators for this receptor, but how such drugs achieve their selectivity and regulate M4 receptor activity in response to different activators has remained a major, elusive, knowledge gap, despite high clinical implications.The new study, published in eLife, and led by a team of researchers from the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (MIPS), has now addressed this important gap in our molecular-level understanding of how allosteric modulators mediate their effects at the M4 muscarinic receptor.In this study, the MIPS researchers (who are world-leaders in the discovery and development of next-generation neuromedicines, including allosteric modulators, for difficult-to-treat mental illnesses), rigorously quantified the pharmacological properties of two distinct 'positive' allosteric modulators, alone or in combination with two different agonists, at the human M4 muscarinic receptor.The team also tapped into technological advancements in the fields of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics simulations to unlock first-of-its-kind evidence of key molecular mechanisms underlying allosteric pharmacology, advancing our understanding of the structural basis of allosteric modulation of the M4 muscarinic receptor and paving the way for the discovery and design of future allosteric drugs.      In particular, the researchers revealed a vital role for ligand\u2013receptor\u2013G protein complex stability, mediated by conformational dynamics between these sites, in the ultimate determination of affinity, efficacy, degree of allosteric modulation, and mechanisms underlying species variability of allosteric drugs, all of which have significant implications for preclinical-to-clinical discovery and translation of such agents.Corresponding author, and MIPS Senior Research Fellow, Dr. David Thal, said that allosteric modulation of GPCRs is a major paradigm in drug discovery; however, despite decades of research, a molecular-level understanding of the general principles that govern the myriad pharmacological effects exerted by GPCR allosteric modulators has remained elusive.\"By determining the cryo-EM structures of the M4 muscarinic receptor and applying molecular dynamics simulations, the team has provided a holistic framework for further GPCR mechanistic studies and, in turn, opened up new approaches for GPCR drug discovery,\" said Dr. Thal.Professor Arthur Christopoulos, FAA FAHMS, also a corresponding author on the study, Dean of the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Director of Monash's Neuromedicines Discovery Centre, said the results have broader implications for the development of new allosteric medicines designed to reduce currently untreated symptoms associated with schizophrenia and cognitive disorders.\"The vast majority of patients with schizophrenia have impaired cognition, which is untreated by any existing antipsychotic drug, and its severity remains a major predictor of prognosis. However the development of new safe and effective treatments has remained stagnant for decades,\" said Professor Christopoulos.\"The research conducted in this study is a vital step toward progressing the next generation of medical therapies and innovations that could make a true impact when it comes to improving health and saving lives.\"Dr. Celine Valant, also a corresponding author and Senior Research Fellow at MIPS, said the findings open up exciting new opportunities.\"The evidence presented in this study will enable future GPCR drug discovery research and potentially lead to the development of next generation medicines for the treatment of a range of psychiatric and cognitive disorders,\" said Dr. Valant.

  "text": "Proteins are biological molecules that perform almost all biochemical tasks in all forms of life. In doing so, the tiny structures perform ultra-fast movements. In order to investigate these dynamic processes more precisely than before, researchers have developed a new algorithm that can be used to evaluate measurements at X-ray free-electron lasers such as the SwissFEL more efficiently. They have now presented it in the journal Structural Dynamics.          Sometimes, when using the navigation system while traveling by car, the device will locate you off the road for a short time. This is due to the inaccuracy of the GPS positioning, which can be as much as several meters. However, the algorithm in the sat nav will soon notice this and correct the trajectory displayed on the screen, i.e. put it back on the road.A comparable principle for addressing unrealistic motion sequences has now been successfully applied by a team of researchers led by PSI physicist Cecilia Casadei. However, their objects of investigation are about a billion times smaller than a car: proteins. These building blocks of life fulfill crucial functions in all known organisms. In doing so, they often perform ultra-fast movements. Analyzing these movements precisely is crucial for our understanding of proteins which can help us produce new medical agents, among other things.How to 'film' proteinsTo further improve the understanding of protein movements, Casadei, together with other PSI researchers, a researcher at DESY in Hamburg and other colleagues at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, U.S., has developed an algorithm that evaluates data obtained in experiments at an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). An XFEL is a large-scale research facility that delivers extremely intense and short flashes of laser-quality X-ray light. Here, a method called time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (TR-SFX) can be used to study the ultra-fast movements of proteins.Credit: Paul Scherrer InstituteThe measurements are very complex for several reasons: the proteins are much too small to be imaged directly, their movements are incredibly fast, and the intense pulse of X-ray light of an FEL completely destroys the proteins. On the experimental level, TR-SFX already solves all these problems: no individual molecule is measured, but rather a large number of identical protein molecules are induced to grow together in a regular arrangement to form protein crystals.When the FEL X-ray light shines on these crystals, the information is captured in time before the crystals and their proteins are destroyed by the pulse of light. The raw data from the measurements are available as so-called diffraction images: light spots that are created by the regular arrangement of the proteins in the crystal and registered by a detector.      How to evaluate the measurement dataWhere the experimental challenges have been overcome, the evaluation of the data is just beginning. \"The measurement of each individual crystal provides only two percent of the data of a complete image.\" This incompleteness has physical and experimental reasons and can only be eliminated by combining the measurement data of many crystals in a meaningful way. Casadei's research focuses on exactly how to go about this.The method established so far is called \"binning and merging\".\"A lot has been achieved with this method in the last decade,\" says Casadei. With this method, the data are divided into time intervals and all data within one interval, a 'bin,' are averaged. However, a lot of detailed information is also lost in this averaging. \"You could say that the individual images of the protein film are then all a bit washed out,\" Casadei continues. \"That's why we have developed a method that allows us to get more out of the measurement data.\"The new method devised by Casadei and her colleagues is called \"low-pass spectral analysis\", or LPSA for short. \"Similar to electronics or audio technology, we apply a low-pass filter,\" Casadei explains. \"However, in our case it comes in the form of advanced linear algebra. We apply these formulas to remove unwanted noise from the data without losing the relevant details.\"In short and simple terms, the raw data, i.e. the diffraction images of the protein crystals, are tracked throughout the protein motion. This movement is assumed to be smooth, i.e. jerk-free. Similar to how the navigation system corrects itself when the car seemingly leaves the course of the road, the new algorithm by Casadei and her colleagues mitigates errors of the protein movement reconstruction.HDR for protein filmsLay people may not notice an immense difference in the new protein films. But for the cineastes at X-ray free-electron lasers, the improvement is comparable to switching from a DVD film to HDR quality.\"Above all, the new algorithm now allows researchers here at SwissFEL at PSI to extract more information from their data,\" says Casadei. Conversely, this means the algorithm can help shorten long measurement times. Since beam time is always in high demand at large-scale research facilities, and in particular at SwissFEL, this is a most welcome prospect for protein researchers using this highly advanced facility.

  "answer_race": " Supercooled water can be studied.",
  "question_squad": " What is the temperature range of water known as?",
  "answer_squad": " no man's land",
  "text": "Researchers at EPFL have found a way to study water in \"no man's land,\" a subzero temperature range where water crystallizes rapidly. Historically, the inability to access \"no man's land\" has prevented scientists from unriddling the anomalous nature of water, but the breakthrough method can now change that.          Water is one of the most essential and widespread compounds on Earth. Covering over 70% of the planet's surface, it has shaped its composition and geology, it regulates its climate and weather patterns, and is at the foundation of all life as we know it.But water is also weird. It exhibits a number of anomalous properties, of which scientists have identified over seventy\u2014so far. Several theories try to explain these anomalies, but verifying them experimentally is difficult. One of the reasons is that this would require studying water between 160 K and 232 K (-113 \u00b0C to -41 \u00b0C), a notorious temperature range known as \"no man's land\" where water crystallizes so fast that it has been impossible for scientists to study its properties.But why would anyone want to cool water to such low temperatures? Because when water is cooled way below its freezing point it becomes 'supercooled' with unique and fascinating properties; for example, under certain conditions it can remain in liquid form but can freeze instantly when disturbed or exposed to certain substances. Supercooled water is obtained by taking liquid water and cooling it below the freezing point while using tricks to prevent it from crystallizing or at least slowing this process down. However, even with these tricks, crystallization in 'no man's land' is still too fast.\"An experiment to systematically probe the structure of water across so-called 'no man's land' has remained elusive for decades,\" says Professor Ulrich Lorenz at EPFL's School of Basic Sciences. Now, scientists led by Lorenz have found a way to do just that. The team developed a way to rapidly prepare deeply supercooled water at a well-defined temperature and probe it with electron diffraction before it can crystallize.\"We have still not fully understood why water is an anomalous liquid, despite this topic being hotly debated for over forty years,\" says Lorenz. \"The answer appears to lie in 'no man's land.\" But because of fast crystallization, any measurement over the full temperature range has not been possible. We do this for the first time. This brings us closer to solving this long-standing mystery.\"The scientists performed the experiments with a specialized time-resolved electron microscope they custom built in their lab. They prepared the supercooled water at a well-defined temperature and probed it directly before crystallization occurred. To do this, they cooled a layer of graphene to 101 K and deposited a thin film of amorphous ice. They then locally melted the film with a microsecond laser pulse to obtain water in 'no man's land,\" and captured a diffraction pattern with an intense, high-brightness electron pulse.The researchers found that as water is cooled from room temperature to cryogenic temperatures, its structure evolves smoothly. At temperatures just below 200 K (about -73 \u00b0C), the structure of water begins to look like that of amorphous ice\u2014a form of ice where water molecules are in a disordered state\u2014unlike the tidy crystalline ice we are usually familiar with.\"The fact that the structure evolves smoothly allows us to narrow down the range of possible explanations for the origin of water anomalies,\" says Lorenz. \"Our findings and the method we have developed bring us closer to unriddling the mysteries of water. It is difficult to escape the fascination of this ubiquitous and seemingly simple liquid that still has not given up all of its secrets.\"The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.

The research paper\u2014recently highlighted as Pick of the Week in the journal, Chemical Science\u2014showcases the researchers' innovative probe that binds to inositol pyrophosphate or '5-PP-InsP5\".5-PP-InsP5 plays a fundamental role in various biological processes, including cell growth, programmed cell death, and enzyme regulation, and new roles are still emerging with it recently being found to be a key regulator of blood glucose levels.Due to its diverse roles in cellular processes, 5-PP-InsP5 is an attractive target for developing therapeutic drugs.However, biomedical and drug discovery research relies on 'small molecule probes' to detect specific target molecules and, until now, no 5-PP-InsP5-specific probes existed.The Loughborough University and University of Oxford research team\u2014which includes Dr. Stephen Butler, Dr. Felix Plasser, and Professor Barry Potter\u2014combined their chemical synthetic and computational modeling expertise to create a probe specific to 5-PP-InsP5 that emits a bright red light upon binding.The intensity and duration of this light can be measured to quantify the levels of 5-PP-InsP5 during different biological processes, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its precise functions, mechanisms, and therapeutic potential.Of the importance of the research, Dr. Stephen Butler commented, \"A key motivation in our lab is to develop molecular tools with real-world applications, so we're excited about the potential of the probe reported here as a drug discovery tool, that could enable high-throughput screening of drug-like molecules that modulate biological processes involving the cellular messenger 5-PP-InsP5.\"Other inositol pyrophosphates exist and are still emerging in biology, so methods to detect, synthesize and exploit these could also be necessary and will be facilitated by the probe design features established in this project.\"Professor Barry Potter, of the University of Oxford, added, \"I have spent almost all of my independent scientific career in research on inositol phosphates and feel that the advent of these new pyrophosphate messengers, with their emerging biological functions, is truly exciting for the field and calls for innovation.\"Our highly collaborative new paper presents a very timely technique to measure such a messenger for the first time and should enable a wealth of further developments in the area.\"The co-lead authors of the study are Megan Shipton and Fathima Jamion, a Ph.D. and final year undergraduate student from Oxford and Loughborough, respectively.Megan and Fathima said of their achievement in a joint statement: \"We are delighted to work as part of this collaborative team to take some vital steps in helping further uncover the biological roles of 5-PP-InsP5.\"It's especially rewarding to see our combined work published in a top chemistry journal and we look forward to seeing how it fuels future research in this area.\"The research paper, titled \"Expedient synthesis and luminescence sensing of the inositol pyrophosphate cellular messenger 5-PP-InsP5,\" is Chemical Science.

  "text": "A study led by researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory could uncover new ways to produce more powerful, longer-lasting batteries and memory devices.          The research examines the causes behind the ordering, or pattern formation, of ions that carry a positive charge, also called cations, in double perovskite oxides, a type of metal considered promising as a potential source of cleaner, more sustainable energy for its magnetism and ability to conduct electricity. The paper, titled \"Insights into Cation Ordering of Double Perovskite Oxides from Machine Learning and Causal Relations,\" is published in Chemistry of Materials.\"If we can understand the fundamental mechanism behind these properties, then we could attempt to grow or otherwise create these perovskite materials for such applications as batteries, memory devices and capacitors,\" said Ayana Ghosh, an ORNL research scientist and the study's lead author. \"We've developed a formula from this study that we'll give to the rest of the world.\"Ghosh and researchers from the SRM Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai, India, sought to determine how the patterns formed by cations affect stability in double perovskites. The more stable the material, the better suited it is for potential energy applications.\"This cation ordering can be affected by a number of variables,\" Ghosh said. \"Sizes of the ions matter. Distortions come into play. We wanted to know: Is there one single factor that would drive cation ordering in this kind of system? If so, what is that factor?\"The team relied on resources from two DOE Office of Science user facilities\u2014data collected at ORNL's Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences and time on the Cori supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center\u2014to develop a new computational framework. The system combined causal analysis and traditional machine learning with density functional theory, which estimates materials' electronic and atomic structures. Researchers trained the algorithm on various cation types and patterns within double perovskite systems to predict conditions that lead to specific ordering of cations.The team combined the cause-and-effect relationships observed with the findings from standard predictive machine learning algorithms. Analysis of the results identified trilinear coupling, an interaction among three types of particles, as the necessary condition behind clear layered ordering\u2014one of the essential patterns of cation ordering.Trilinear coupling combines three types of structural modes that push the cations through the necessary phases to result in properties such as multiferroicity, the combination of magnetization and polarization that makes perovskites promising for energy applications.\"If you have this type of coupling, you should have the formation of clear layered ordering,\" Ghosh said. \"The ordering won't occur without it. You can think of the three modes as fundamental building blocks. This wasn't known before.\"Next steps include applying those findings to identify conditions necessary for other types of ordering to design new phases of double perovskite oxides.\"This new insight gives us a road map to go beyond what we've already known from theory,\" Ghosh said. \"Now we can explore further based on these principles.\" More information:Ayana Ghosh et al, Insights into Cation Ordering of Double Perovskite Oxides from Machine Learning and Causal Relations, Chemistry of Materials (2022).

  "text": "Researchers at Flinders University have discovered a new low-cost material that can be made into lenses for thermal imaging\u2014pointing to new advanced manufacturing applications for this powerful technology.          Thermal and infrared imaging are used in many industries including defense, security and surveillance, medicine, electrical engineering, space exploration and autonomous vehicle operation\u2014but the materials required are expensive and becoming more difficult to find.Lower cost alternatives are needed so a multi-disciplinary team in chemistry and physics at Flinders University have developed a solution in an entirely new polymer material made from sulfur and cyclopentadiene. They say the high-performance polymers have the unique ability to transmit infrared light.\"The material combines high performance, low cost and efficient manufacturing,\" says Ph.D. candidate Sam Tonkin, first author in a new article in the Advanced Optical Materials journal.\"It has the potential to expand the use of thermal imaging to new industries which were previously limited by the high cost of germanium or chalcogenide lenses. This is a rapidly developing field which will see exciting advances in the next few years,\" he says.Sulfur is produced in many millions of tons in petroleum refining. Billions of tons are available in geological deposits. It is plentiful and cheap.Cyclopentadiene is also derived from low-cost materials produced in petroleum refining.The lenses used for thermal imaging are currently made from germanium or chalcogenide glasses. Germanium is an element in short supply and it is very expensive. Some germanium lenses can costs thousands of dollars.Chalcogenide glasses also have shortcomings. For instance, they are often made of toxic elements such as arsenic or selenium.Co-author Dr. Le Nhan Pham, a Flinders University researcher in computational and physical chemistry, says reacting sulfur and cyclopentadiene together provides a black plastic with high transparency to infrared light.\"This is the light that is detected by thermal imaging cameras.\"This novel material was designed to have a wide array of potential applications from space engineering to military operation, and to civil and aerospace industries,\" he says.The polymer can be molded into a variety of lenses, which can be used, for example, to magnify the image in a thermal camera. Because the polymer is black, it can also be used to conceal and protect thermal imaging equipment. The polymer can therefore be used as camouflage to hide a camera used for surveillance.The infrared light passes through the polymer, so one can see through it using an infrared camera. This property is useful for defense operations and wildlife surveillance.The polymer also has many other features:The material has the highest long-wave infrared light transparency ever reported for a plastic.The raw materials are low cost: for a 1 g lens the building blocks cost less than 1 cent.The material allows rapid molding into various shapes such as lenses. This is a more rapid process than current lens production which relies on slow milling methods.The study also reported some key scientific advances, including a new reactor that was designed to enable the key reaction. A key challenge was to be able to use the building blocks in gaseous form. The use of gaseous monomers was previous thought not to be possible by other researchers in the area.The study also includes quantum mechanical calculations to understand how and why the material is transparent to infrared light used in thermal imaging. These insights will also be useful in the future to design new lenses with further improved properties. More information:Samuel J.

  "answer_squad": " consuming fish with elevated mercury concentrations",
  "text": "A new study at Ume\u00e5 University provides insight into how mercury transforms into its more toxic form, methylmercury, with the help of small sulfur-containing substances known as thiols.          Mercury spread in the environment is a critical issue, due to the severe effects on human health and ecosystems. The main mercury exposure for humans comes from consuming fish with elevated mercury concentrations, especially in the form of methylmercury. Most of the methylmercury in the environment is formed by specific microorganisms by transforming mercury.Mareike Gutensohn, at the Department of Chemistry at Ume\u00e5 University, has explored how small sulfur-containing substances, called thiols, influence this transformation. Thiols can be found dissolved in oxygen-free waters or within the surface of cells, as part of proteins, and they play a critical role in forming methylmercury since they can attach to mercury and affect how easily it is transformed or absorbed by microorganisms.Monitoring the environment is importantIn her thesis, she has investigated systematically the combined effect of chemical and biological factors on the formation of methylmercury and the mechanistic behind it. The study unveiled that the formation of dissolved thiols, tied to cell metabolism, leads to enhanced production of methylmercury.\"The formation of both thiols and methylmercury heavily depends on the metabolic activity of microorganisms. Interestingly, the composition and concentration of the formed thiols significantly impact the potential for methylmercury formation. This underlines the importance of monitoring the formation of thiols within the environment,\" says Mareike Gutensohn, doctoral student at the Department of Chemistry.The research also provided the first systematic characterization of the outer and inner cell membranes of the studied microorganism, with respect to thiols within the surface of the cells. For this, Mareike Gutensohn used advanced spectroscopic techniques known as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a powerful method to study cell-mercury interaction.Complex relationshipThe characterization unveiled variations in thiol concentration across the cell membrane, shedding light on the complex relationship between thiols and mercury transformation.\"While our understanding of thiols' role in methylmercury formation has significantly improved, there's still much to explore, particularly the role and implications of the differences in thiol concentration within the cell surface,\" says Mareike Gutensohn.This study advances our understanding of the complex interplay of chemical and biological factors impacting mercury's transformation into methylmercury. This breakthrough in scientific understanding helps predict and control methylmercury formation, contributing to a safer and healthier ecosystem.

  "text": "What makes for the ultimate beer drinking experience? Some like theirs in a frosty glass, others with a wedge of lime. But when it comes to froth\u2014or the head as it's commonly known\u2014what's the best amount and how can it be achieved?          Too much froth and you're left with a smear of bubbles across your face and hanging from your nose as you desperately try to get at the beer beneath. But too little will cause problems in your stomach.You see, if there's no foam the CO2 stays dissolved in the beer. If you then eat something, the foam erupts in your stomach rather than the glass, causing beer bloat. That's why tipping a glass to avoid a frothy head is a rookie error.Hoping to solve this issue, a company in Japan has designed a beer can with two pulls, which control the level of foam produced by opening the can, resulting in the perfect amount of froth.This is just the most recent development in beer technology. Humanity has been chasing the perfect pint since beer's inception, which evidence suggests was roughly 13,000 years ago near Haifa, Israel\u2014the oldest known record of human-made alcohol.Under pressureBeer consumption has evolved through the ages.Those first producers and consumers of beer in Israel were the Natufian people, a group of hunter-gatherers in the eastern Mediterranean. Their beer would have been unfiltered, which made it look like thin porridge.This led to the invention of beer straws around the fifth to the fourth millennium in Iran and Iraq, which featured a filter on the tip that held back the beer solids. These straws were similar in design to a modern bombilla (a yerba mate tea straw used for at least four centuries in South America).The next significant leap in brewing was not the glass bottle, but another airtight closure: the barrel.Advances in cooperage (the making of wooden casks and barrels) during the Middle Ages meant that the CO2 produced by yeast during fermentation remained in the solution within the container, rather than dissipating and giving it the porridge-like consistency of previous beers. This meant beer could be held and dispensed under pressure for the first time. This inexorably altered the appearance and flavor of beer, as it became effervescent and foamy when served fresh.Foam was a vital component of proper beer because it showed its freshness.A good headThe foamy head was at one time called a \"collar\"\u2014a term that first appeared in print in John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row. There seems to be no origin story attached to the moniker. And sadly, there seems less need to apply a name to beer foam since society has strayed from proper beer pouring techniques.Traditionally, beer was allowed to foam up so much as it was being poured that a \"foam scraper\" (also known as a \"foam flipper\" or \"head cutter\") was needed to shave the excess off the glass rim. A large head was achieved by pouring the beer in an upright glass and encouraging excessive foaming. This technique dissipates the trapped CO2 and brings positive flavor elements to the forefront.These days you'll notice that glasses are tipped while beer is poured. This is done to minimize foam but leads to a less pleasurable, gaseous experience instead of a creamy, toasty sip.Next time you order a pint you should ask your bartender to pour the amber stuff into an upright glass. This is all to say, don't fear the foam, it's integral to your enjoyment. Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

  "text": "In a concerted effort with collaborators from the University College London, Professor Zhengxiao Guo from the Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong (HKU), and Professor Junwang Tang, now at the Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, have jointly developed a highly active and selective catalytic material that can efficiently convert methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into formaldehyde, an essential chemical in a waste-free manner.          This innovative material, derived from tungsten trioxide (WO3 catalyst), features a dual active site comprising copper and tungsten atomic species that work in tandem to ensure an effective and selective conversion process. The conversion process can achieve nearly 100% selectivity under visible light, which avoids unwanted byproducts and increase efficiency, making it an eco-friendly alternative to current production methods. The findings have just been published in the journal Nature Communications.Change the unchanged: Methane conversionMethane, the principal component of natural gas, is a widely used carbon source for numerous chemicals. Nevertheless, it is also a potent greenhouse gas, with more than 70 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. The catalytic conversion of methane (converting methane into other chemicals), therefore, presents a tremendous opportunity for achieving net-zero energy and chemical supplies while simultaneously addressing environmental concerns.However, methane is an extremely stable molecule, making it resistant to activation, particularly under mild or ambient conditions. Thus, achieving high activity and selectivity in methane conversion is a significant challenge, and the selective activation of the intermolecular carbon-hydrogen bond is often considered by many chemists as one of the most elusive \"holy grails\" in catalysis.Formaldehyde, on the other hand, is a high-volume commodity chemical with a market value of USD 8 billion, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7%. It is used in household, commercial, aviation, medical and automotive products and serves as a valuable precursor for melamine, urea-formaldehyde and phenolic resins, among others. Formaldehyde is also safely used in the manufacture of vaccines, anti-infective drugs and hard-gel capsules. Currently, it is produced through methanol oxidation-dehydrogenation using silver or metal-oxide catalysts at high reactor temperatures of more than 500\u00b0C\u2013600\u00b0C, resulting in substantial carbon dioxide emissions and energy penalties.      Harnessing sunlight to convert methaneIn their study, the team discovers a new way of turning methane gas into formaldehyde using sunlight. They found that a mixture of atomically dispersed copper and partially reduced tungsten species over tungsten oxide worked really well\u2014the synergistic ensemble enabling exceptional photocatalytic methane conversion to formaldehyde under ambient visible light. The process exhibited nearly 100% selectivity and high conversion efficiency, significantly outperforming previously reported photocatalysts (with a turnover frequency, TOF = 8.5\u00d7106 \u03bcmol (HCHO)\u00b7g-1(cocatalyst)\u00b7h-1).Through mechanistic analysis, they figured out that the copper helped to move electrons around and create reactive molecular species while the tungsten helped to activate the methane gas. Specifically, the copper acted as electron acceptors and promoted photo-induced electron transfer from the conduction band to dioxygen, generating reactive hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO\u00b7). Meanwhile, the adjacent tungsten atom that had a partial positive charge functioned as hole acceptors. The preferred adsorption and activation site of water produced hydroxyl radicals and effectively activated methane to methyl radicals. The synergy of the adjacent dual active sites greatly enhances the overall efficiency and selectivity of the conversion process.This finding paves the way for further research and development of new photo-catalysts for a variety of chemical conversions, promoting more sustainable and efficient processes in the chemical industry.\"Solar conversion of methane is highly desirable for both low-carbon and high-value-added chemical syntheses. However, product selectivity and production efficiency are key to success. This requires an in-depth understanding of the conversion mechanism, careful design of the catalyst, and complementary techniques to confirm its performance\u2014a good case of multidisciplinary tasks that require strong collaborative dedication. That's exactly what the team has managed to do\u2014with much value-added outcome,\" said Professor Zhengxiao Guo, one of the corresponding authors of the paper.

  "text": "With its golden hue, bittersweet notes and frothy head, Stefan Fritsche's latest brew looks and tastes like any other beer.          But the revolutionary tipple, developed at Fritsche's brewery in the German town of Neuzelle, was made with just two ingredients: powder and water.\"Everyone can have their own home brewery\" with his new invention, Fritsche told AFP at the premises near the border with Poland.For now, the recipe finalized earlier this year is non-alcoholic and also contains no carbon dioxide, meaning it has no bubbles.But Fritsche, 56, is also developing an alcoholic version and eventually planning to add bubbles to make it even more beer-like.The main target market will be African and Asian countries, since a powder is far easier and cheaper to transport over long distances than bottles of beer.But the product may not go down too smoothly at home in Germany, which has a 500-year-old purity law around beer known as the \"Reinheitsgebot\".\"We know that pilsner drinkers and craft beer enthusiasts, especially in Germany, will initially be skeptical about our product,\" the brewery admits on its website.It is unclear whether the product could even be marketed as beer under the strict rules, which limit the ingredients to malt, hops, yeast and water.Fritsche declines to reveal his recipe but argues that his invention is necessary in a world that needs sustainable solutions.The brewer is still working with investors to roll out the powder commercially, but is hoping to start selling it within around four months.Sustainable ambitionsThe powdered format, developed with European laboratories over the past two years, makes the beverage 90 percent cheaper to export than traditional beer, he said.                The brewery believes that the powdered format, developed with European laboratories over the past two years, makes the beverage 90 percent cheaper to export than traditional beer.             \"We want to become the first sustainable brewery in the world.\"According to the Impact CO2 carbon footprint calculator, packaging and transport account for 70 percent of the environmental impact of a liter (around two pints) of beer.      The powdered format also saves time, as laboratory production is faster than traditional brewing, which takes two months on average.But German experts are skeptical about whether the idea will catch on.Powdered beer is a \"nice innovation\", but \"it will not endanger or even challenge our traditional breweries\", said Benedikt Meier of the Bavarian Private Breweries Association.The \"Bier und Wir\" brewers' association also has doubts.\"The enjoyment of beer is primarily about conviviality, as it is enjoyed in pubs, in your local, at a party or among friends and like-minded people,\" it said.\"A beer powder whose use focuses on preparation at home is not a serious alternative for this target group.\"Previous attempts to market powdered beers have fallen flat.In 2016, a Danish brewery announced the creation of four varieties of powder with different flavors\u2014but no trace of the project remains on its website.And in 2014, US company Lipsmark made headlines with its hard-liquor sachets, but the product was banned in most states and then withdrawn before it even hit the shelves.But Fritsche is determined that his product will succeed where others have failed.\"We want to go down a new path, so to speak... to make a real, normal and good-tasting beer out of powder,\" he said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:German brewery has high hops for powdered beer (2023, May 28)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-german-brewery-high-powdered-beer.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have attracted much attention because of high conversion efficiency, low environmental pollution, and high specific energy, which can be widely used in vehicles such as automobiles, airplanes, and stationary power stations.          The cathodic and anodic electrochemical catalysis processes in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) are mainly composed of unit steps such as liquid-phase mass transfer, species adsorption and desorption, electron transfer, and surface transformation occurring at the electrode interface in series.It implies that electrochemical catalysis is a complex system including multiple scales in space and time: electron transfer at the quantum scale; active sites at the atomic scale; the triple phase boundary and the electrocatalytic ORR mechanism at the molecular level; catalyst and proton conductor at the nanometer scale; the catalytic layer and MEA at the micrometer scale; and the fuel cell stack at the meter scale.Particularly, each of the scales could greatly affect the electrochemical ORR process and the cell performance. Thus deeply understanding the characteristics and behavior under any scale is the key to greatly enhance the electrocatalytic performance. Of the scales, the catalyst design at the nanometer scale has attracted great attention.Recently, the research group led by Prof. Zidong Wei and Jing Li from Chongqing University, China, outlined the recent developments of carbon-based ORR catalysts from mechanistic understanding and porous structure. The review was published in Chinese Journal of Catalysis.Developing carbon-based catalysts contributes to the large-scale application of fuel cells and metal-air batteries on account of their extremely high cost effectiveness. This review summarized the research progress regarding carbon-based catalysts in terms of the fabrication of active sites, catalyst stability, and strategies for forming porous structures.Atomic-scale dispersion and doping are the most used methods in generating active sites in metal-containing carbon-based catalysts. Heteroatomic doping is a common strategy for fabricating active sites in metal-free carbon-based catalysts. We then analyzed the causes of catalyst deactivation and how to improve the stabilities and anti-poisoning properties of the catalysts.Finally, as the porous structures significantly affect the exposure of the active sites and mass transfer, the effects of the different porous structures on the ORR and the preparation strategies of micro-, meso-, and macroporous carbon materials were reviewed.

  "answer_squad": " amylose starch",
  "text": "A group of researchers from universities in Thailand and Malaysia have collaborated to develop a unique film that is good for the environment and can decompose naturally. They made this film using leftover pineapple stems, which helps reduce the use of harmful plastic films. This new film has the potential to be used as packaging material, contributing to a more sustainable way of doing business and promoting a circular economy.          In the study published in Membranes, Associate Professor Taweechai Amornsakchai from Mahidol University, Thailand led his team of researchers to successfully developed a biodegradable starch film derived from pineapple stem waste, offering a sustainable alternative to non-biodegradable petroleum-based films commonly used for single-use applications that do not require high strength. The key ingredient utilized in this film is high amylose starch extracted from pineapple stems, which serves as the matrix for the material. To enhance its ductility and flexibility, glycerol and citric acid were incorporated as additives.Maintaining a fixed glycerol content of 25%, the researchers experimented with varying levels of citric acid, ranging from 0% to 15% by weight of starch. This approach allowed for the preparation of films with a wide spectrum of mechanical properties, catering to diverse application requirements. As the concentration of citric acid increased, the resulting film exhibited a softer and weaker nature while demonstrating enhanced elongation at the point of fracture. The mechanical properties of the films spanned a broad range, from a strength of approximately 21.5 MPa with 2.9% elongation, to a strength of about 6.8 MPa with 35.7% elongation.To gain further insights into the structure of the films, X-ray diffraction analysis was performed, revealing a semi-crystalline nature. Additionally, the films displayed desirable water-resistant properties and the ability to be heat-sealed, opening up potential applications as packaging materials. To showcase the film's viability for single-use purposes, an exemplar single-use package was successfully demonstrated, underscoring its practicality and versatility.In order to validate the biodegradability of the material, a soil burial test was conducted. The results unequivocally confirmed that the starch film was biodegradable, as it completely disintegrated into particles smaller than 1 mm within the remarkably short span of one month. This promising characteristic suggests that the film has the potential to significantly mitigate the adverse environmental impact associated with the persistence of non-biodegradable materials.The development of this biodegradable starch film from pineapple stem waste holds immense promise for addressing the growing concerns regarding the proliferation of non-biodegradable packaging materials. By utilizing an abundant and renewable agricultural byproduct, the researchers have not only offered an eco-friendly alternative but have also contributed to the efficient utilization of resources and waste reduction. Furthermore, the incorporation of glycerol and citric acid additives allows for customization of the film's mechanical properties, enabling it to cater to a wide array of applications where strength requirements are not excessively demanding.This study serves as a significant milestone in the pursuit of sustainable materials for single-use applications, showcasing the potential of biodegradable films derived from agricultural waste. The findings highlight the importance of exploring innovative approaches to address environmental challenges and emphasize the feasibility of transitioning from petroleum-based materials to renewable alternatives. As the demand for eco-friendly solutions continues to escalate, the development of biodegradable starch films from pineapple stem waste represents a noteworthy contribution to the field of sustainable materials and paves the way for a greener and more sustainable future.

  "text": "Plasma engineers and chemists at the University of Illinois have demonstrated a sustainable way of forming carbon-carbon bonds\u2014the bedrock of all organic compounds\u2014without expensive, rare metals that are typically required as catalysts in bond-forming organic reactions.          Through an interdisciplinary collaboration, Illinois researchers in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering, Bioengineering and Chemistry combined their expertise to develop this novel metal-catalyst-free approach that could lead organic chemistry in a new direction, according to the researchers.In the study, \"Plasma Electrochemistry for Carbon\u2212Carbon Bond Formation via Pinacol Coupling,\" published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the team explains how they used electricity and a plasma-liquid process to generate solvated electrons to form carbon-carbon bonds in a pinacol coupling reaction. C-C bond formation is widely used in the production of many man-made chemicals like pharmaceuticals and plastics.According to researchers, this is the first example of plasma-generated solvated electrons for an organic redox coupling reaction and offers a sustainable solution for similar reductive organic reactions. Typically, such reactions require metal reagents or catalysts that are not only scarce and costly, but also present safety or environmental issues and sometimes require heat in the reactive process.\"Our process only really requires electricity\u2014other than the reactor cell and equipment\u2014and in the future hopefully this can come from renewable sources like wind or solar or nuclear, so the whole process is sustainable,\" said study co-author R. Mohan Sankaran, Donald Biggar Willett Professor in Engineering in the Department of Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering.Sankaran said their process produces electrons from argon gas and then injects these electrons into solution to generate solvated electrons, a powerful chemical species typically generated by radiolysis, which requires complex equipment.\"In our case, the solvated electrons are generated with just a DC power supply and a relatively simple electrolysis reactor that houses our electrodes and the solution where we have the organic substrates,\" said Sankaran, whose group has been developing atmospheric pressure plasmas for over a decade, and in previous work, has applied this type of plasma-liquid process to other applications\u2014nanoparticle synthesis and nitrogen fixation. \"We were curious about organic chemistry, but we had no expertise in either the methods or the characterization.\"      Sankaran, who reached out to Jeffrey S. Moore, research professor in chemistry, for expertise, said this project would not have been possible without the collaboration.\"Most of this is chemistry\u2014something that my group doesn't do\u2014and there is no way we would have succeeded without having someone with the requisite chemistry background,\" Sankaran said.Jian Wang, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral associate in the Moore group, brought his expertise in chemistry and materials science to the project and worked with plasma expert Scott Dubowsky, study co-author and research scientist in the Sankaran group, to learn the plasma-liquid process and then identify an organic reaction to study.Wang experimented with different organic substrates, characterizing reactions using various analytical techniques, and ultimately chose pinacol coupling, because it is a well-established reaction for carbon-carbon bond formation and a reaction they believed could work with the plasma liquid process. Matthew Confer, another co-author and a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Rohit Bhargava, professor of bioengineering and faculty affiliate in chemistry, used his computational chemistry expertise to model how the pinacol product was formed from the solvated electron chemistry and radical reactions.\"This is an excellent illustration of the golden rule for a successful collaboration: the best collaborators share a common goal but bring different expertise,\" said Moore, Stanley O. Ikenberry Research Professor, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor.There have been a few studies where a plasma was used for an organic reaction, Sankaran explained, but the reactions and the mechanism were different.\"The plasma was typically used to oxidize a chemical and the chemical that was produced by the plasma was a reactive oxygen species. In our case, the reaction we studied was reduction which required electrons (or solvated electrons), and the reduction led to the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds,\" Sankaran said.Their next step will be applying their process to another organic chemistry reaction and showing that this approach is general and can be applied to different reactions.\"We also hope to find a reaction that is difficult to carry out, because it has a low yield, requires harsh conditions, or there is no active metal,\" said Sankaran, who also explained that they hope to address one issue their study revealed\u2014that yields can be limited by mass transfer limitations. \"Our reaction occurs at the interface of a plasma and the solution, and for the substrate to reach the interface, it must diffuse. We can address this issue by incorporating liquid flow which will enhance mass transport by convection. Liquid flow will also potentially help us scale up the process whereby we can make a product continuously.\"Wang said one particular challenge for plasma electrochemistry as an alternative to more traditional organic synthesis is that the plasma is so energetic.\"Although we are able to achieve relatively good yield and selectivity, the control is still not as good as for example traditional chemistries with metal catalysts, or electro- or photocatalytic chemistries,\" Wang said. \"We are working on improving the controllability and selectivity right now.\" More information:Jian Wang et al, Plasma Electrochemistry for Carbon\u2013Carbon Bond Formation via Pinacol Coupling, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2023).

  "text": "Researchers led by Prof. Tian Jia from the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new strategy for visible-light-induced selective carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion by mimicking the key elements and assembly structures of natural photosynthetic purple bacterial chromatophores through supramolecular self-assembly.          This work, which offers new insights for accurately simulating the biological structures and functions of supramolecular assemblies and energy conversion for artificial photosynthesis, was published in Nature Catalysis on May 18.Photosynthesis is the ultimate source of energy and organic matter for nearly all living organisms. In nature, photosynthetic organelles harness solar radiation to produce energy-rich compounds from water and atmospheric CO2 via exquisite supramolecular assemblies.Although artificial photocatalytic cycles have been shown to operate with higher intrinsic efficiencies, the low selectivity and stability in water for multi-electron CO2 reduction hampers their practical applications. The creation of water-compatible artificial photocatalytic systems mimicking the natural photosynthetic apparatus for selective and efficient solar fuel production represents a major challenge.In this study, the researchers used a supramolecular assembly approach to create an artificial photosynthetic chromatophore nanomicelle system based on the structure of natural photosynthetic purple bacteria. The system was applied to selective CO2 catalytic conversion in water under visible light irradiation and showed excellent stability and efficiency.The team proposed a promising solution for energy conversion and storage through \"zero-carbon cycle\" pathways, which is an effective way to alleviate energy crisis and reduce carbon emissions.Benefiting from the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the spherical nanomicelles assembled from amphiphilic tri-block porphyrin-based supramolecules are extremely stable in aqueous phase. As a chromatophore, the nanomicelles exhibited obvious light-harvesting antenna effect and strong resistance to photobleaching.Moreover, electropositive ring-like porphyrin arrays of 4.2 nm in diameter were observed on their surface, and each sub-structure consists of ca. 12 porphyrin by calculation.For the purpose of efficient electron injection, an electronegative carbon monoxide catalyst was chosen as the ideal catalyst because the space distance between the catalyst and the ring-like porphyrin array was drawn closer by electrostatic force. Under the irradiation of visible light, the artificial photocatalytic system achieved the conversion of CO2 to methane with high efficiency and selectivity.In addition, the researchers proposed a two-stage mechanism in which carbon monoxide was regarded as intermediate species, which was further proved by isotope labeling experiment, steady-state and transient absorption spectra and density functional theory calculations.

  "text": "Using a high-speed \"electron camera\" at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and cutting-edge quantum simulations, scientists have directly imaged a photochemical \"transition state,\" a specific configuration of a molecule's atoms determining the chemical outcome, during a ring-opening reaction in the molecule \u03b1-terpinene. This is the first time that scientists have precisely tracked molecular structure through a photochemical ring-opening reaction, triggered when light energy is absorbed by a substance's molecules.          The results, published in Nature Communications, could further our understanding of similar reactions with vital roles in chemistry, such as the production of vitamin D in our bodies.Transition states generally occur in chemical reactions which are triggered not by light but by heat. They are like a point of no return for molecules involved in a chemical reaction: As the molecules gain the energy needed to fuel the reaction, they rearrange themselves into a fleeting configuration before they complete their transformation into new molecules.\"Transition states really tell you a lot about how and why reactions happen,\" said co-author and SLAC scientist Thomas Wolf. \"The investigation of similar critical configurations in photochemical reactions could lead to a better understanding of reactions with key roles in chemistry and biology. It's important that we can now look at some specific characteristics of such reactions using our diffraction techniques.\"Until now, no method existed that was sensitive enough to capture these fleeting states, which last for only millionths of a billionth of second. At MeV-UED, SLAC's instrument for ultrafast electron diffraction, the researchers sent an electron beam with high energy, measured in millions of electronvolts (MeV), through a gas to precisely measure distances between the atoms within the molecules in the gas. Taking snapshots of these distances at different intervals after an initial laser flash allows scientists to create a stop-motion movie of the light-induced atomic rearrangements in the molecules.\"These reactions are important for understanding the quantum mechanics underpinning photochemistry,\" said SLAC scientist and co-author Yusong Liu. \"Comparing our experimental results with quantum simulations of the reaction allows us to get a highly accurate picture of how molecules behave and benchmark the predictive power of theoretical and computational methods.\"In a previous study of a related reaction, MeV-UED allowed the team to capture the coordinated dance between electrons and nuclei. The results provided the first direct confirmation of a half-century-old set of rules about the final product's stereochemistry, or the three-dimensional arrangement of its atoms.In the present experiment, the researchers discovered that some parts of the atomic rearrangements happen earlier than other parts, which provides an explanation for why the specific stereochemistry is created by the reaction.\"I recently looked back on some old presentations I did in college about these types of reactions and the famous set of rules that predict the outcomes. But these rules don't actually explain why and how reactions happen.\" Wolf said. \"And now I'm coming back to that and can start answering these questions and that makes it incredibly exciting for me.\"Another big motivation for doing these experiments, Wolf said, is that the same reaction also happens in biological processes such as the biosynthesis of vitamin D in human skin. The researchers plan to conduct follow-up studies further exploring this connection. More information:Y.

  "text": "Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) provide a practical solution for direct conversion of CO2 to chemicals; however, an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the dynamic reconstruction of active sites for perovskite cathodes during CO2 electrolysis remains a great challenge.          In a study led by Dr. Houfu Lv, Prof. Guoxiong Wang and Prof. Xinhe Bao (Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences), the team identify that iridium-doped Sr2Fe1.45Ir0.05Mo0.5O6-\u03b4 (SFIrM) perovskite displays a dynamic electrochemical reconstruction feature during CO2 electrolysis with abundant exsolution of highly dispersed IrFe alloy nanoparticles (NPs) on the SFIrM surface, which is well investigated using in situ electrochemical X-ray diffraction (XRD), near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).During the electrochemical reconstruction and activation process under a constant voltage mode at 1.0 V for ~4 000 s, the current density gradually increased and finally approached a steady state.The exsolved IrFe alloy NPs display high dispersion with an average diameter of ~1.0 nm and a density above 80 000 \u03bcm-2 on the SFIrM surface. Moreover, the activation time was reduced rapidly with increasing applied voltage (constant voltage: 1.2 V, activation time: within 250 s), with similar particle size and density of the exsolved metal NPs during CO2 electrolysis.

Credit: Science China Press             In addition, in situ NAP-XPS measurements were employed to monitor their catalytic process during CO2 electrolysis to reveal the intrinsic reaction mechanism. Upon application of electrochemical polarization, a broader peak appeared at ca. 290 eV in the C 1s spectra, which could be attributed to carbonate species and was most probably decisive for CO2 electrolysis.The peak area of carbonate species on the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-\u03b4 (SFM) cathode was weaker than that on the SFIrM cathode. The enhanced carbonate intermediate species signal confirmed that the in situ reconstructed IrFe@SFIrM interfaces facilitated CO2 adsorption and activation. IrFe@SFIrM interfaces were thus proposed as the catalytically active sites that devoted to a higher CO2 electrolysis performance than SFM.The initial exsolved IrFe alloy NPs could be re-dispersed sufficiently into smaller nanoclusters via a brief oxidation treatment in air. IrFe alloy NPs were regenerated when the applied voltage was switched on again, and the appearance of the intermediate carbonate peak could be further obtained. The oxidative re-dispersion strategy could efficiently improve the stability by delaying particle aggregation.The research is published in the journal National Science Review.

  "text": "Before their approval, pharmaceuticals not only have to be tested for their effectiveness and safety, but also for their stability, since they are usually stored in pharmacies and private households for years. To test stability, a process is needed that decomposes a drug \"in fast motion.\"          Such a method was recently developed by a team of scientists from the Leibniz Institute for Catalysis in Rostock (LIKAT), the RWTH Aachen University and the Julius Maximilian University of W\u00fcrzburg, accompanied by the company RD&C (Vienna, Austria). The research results have now been published in the journal ACS Central Science.Virtually all drugs are multicomponent or multiphase systems that are embedded in a matrix, i.e., contain excipients and carriers, for example. These additives can interact with the active ingredient over time, for example when the drugs are stored for a longer period of time and impair the effect of the drug. The pharmaceutical industry must disclose all stability data before a new drug is approved, so there is considerable interest in developing reliable predictive tools to assess the safety of drugs.Currently, however, such predictive tools for solid-state properties, particularly with respect to solid-state stability and degradation, are limited. In addition, the rate and decomposition products of solid-state degradation processes are unique for each compound, making the development of stability models very time-consuming and costly. Prediction methods in aqueous environments exist, but they lead to high error rates. Since irrelevant degradation products are often formed under these conditions, these prediction methods imply a high financial and health development risk for the manufacturer of new drugs and for the customer.Based on proof-of-concept studies successfully performed by RD&C and the team, a unique and innovative experimental method for predicting stability profiles and degradation pathways in solid compounds, mixtures and matrices has now been developed. In the literature, the approach is referred to as \"mechanochemistry.\" In this approach, the isolated drug or marketed pharmaceutical product is treated in a vibrating mill in the presence of a decomposition-inducing reagent. Within less than 15 minutes, degradation processes can be observed.Everaldo Krake (LIKAT Rostock), first author of the study and a newly graduated scientist, explains, \"We were able to show this on a series of structurally similar so-called thienopyridines, which are the drugs in antiplatelet tablets. Crucial to the success was the collaboration with the group led by Carsten Bolm (RWTH Aachen University), a world-leading expert in the field of mechanochemistry, and the team of Ulrike Holzgrabe (University of W\u00fcrzburg), a renowned pharmaceutical chemist. This showed that the degradation profiles are identical for both the pure drug and the finished pharmaceutical product. This means that reproducible and relevant statements can be made for this class of drugs in short reaction times using the active ingredient alone. This would be of great importance for accelerated drug approval.\"According to the authors, this new approach represents a paradigm shift in the application of mechanochemical processes in organic chemistry. \"In general, mechanochemical studies of the transformation of small organic molecules, particularly drugs, are carried out with the aim of producing specific structural motifs. The new work now published highlights the potential of this approach to also target specific structural motifs for degradation,\" says Carsten Bolm.This could be important not only for drug testing, but also for organic synthesis in general. \"In the future, it will be interesting to apply this mechanochemical approach to other drug families and to evaluate the role of other stimuli such as light or temperature for the forced degradation process,\" Ulrike Holzgrabe concludes.

I want to use my education and learning to solve the obstacles to a better world. There are many problems like this in the textile industry,\" says Sederholm.Originally from Espoo, Sederholm was already interested in natural sciences during her basic education and particularly keen on chemistry and biology. She started studying for a bachelor's degree at the Aalto University School of Chemical Engineering in 2017.\"During my studies, materials sciences and, in particular, biomaterials started to attract me. I ended up in the Master's Degree Program of Fiber and Polymer Technology, where I was able to familiarize myself with bio-based fibers. It felt right.\"The growing sector needs doctorsIn her master's thesis, Sederholm studied the recyclability of fibers produced with the Ioncell technology. The thesis indicated that recycled Ioncell fibers are just as suitable for textile production as original cellulose fibers. Sederholm graduated with a Master of Science degree in autumn 2022.\"In my master's thesis, I got to familiarize myself with the academic world of research. I liked experimental work and enjoyed my time in the research group.\"Postgraduate studies started to interest Sederholm, so she applied for doctoral studies at Aalto University's Bioinnovation Center, where she was able to start immediately after her master's studies.\"Bio-based textiles are still a new field in Finland, but this sector will surely grow. I believe that there will be a need for doctors with expertise and vision related to biomaterials by the time I finish my doctoral studies.\"Using natural phenomena as a modelIn her doctoral research, Sederholm develops an environmentally friendly way of producing hydrophobic textiles for outdoor clothing. The hydrophobic properties of today's outdoor clothing mainly result from synthetic fossil-based fibers. Fossil-free alternatives, on the other hand, contain chemicals that are harmful for the environment.\"Fortunately, water repellent materials can be found in nature. I try to copy them and apply similar methods in the Ioncell process. One option is to develop lignocellulosic fibers using lignin derived from wood. In addition to having hydrophobic properties, the fibers used in outdoor clothing must be sufficiently strong.\"The cross-disciplinary CelluMimicry study combines Aalto University's expertise in chemical technology and business.\"We are studying how to commercialize bio-based water-repellent materials and how suited they are for mass production.

Results were published in two articles in the Chemical Engineering Journal.          Thermoelectric technology has received considerable attention as a potential solution to energy problems. However, the low thermoelectric value ZT (figure of merit) and energy conversion efficiency of N-type bismuth telluride currently limit its widespread commercial application. Nanoengineering is an effective way to improve the thermoelectric properties of materials, but selecting a suitable second phase can be challenging.In this study, the researchers found that incorporating MnSb2Se4 into BTS can yield remarkable results.Incorporated MSS nanoinclusions have been shown to have multiple benefits. It could simultaneously increase the power factor, resulting from the improved thermal performance due to the energy filtering effect and reduce lattice thermal conductivity originating from intensified phonon scattering by the dislocations.The BTS/0.50wt%MSS composite sample demonstrated a maximum thermoelectric ZT of 1.23 at 345K, and an average ZT of 1.15 in the temperature range of 300\u2013473K.Notably, these values represented an approximate increase of 48% and 42%, respectively, over the matrix BTS. In addition, the composite sample exhibited improved mechanical properties, as evidenced by a 17% increase in its Vickers hardness.The results indicate that the incorporation of the MnSb2Se4 secondary phase is an effective way to improve thermoelectric performance and mechanical properties of BTS.The researchers have made significant progress in optimizing the thermoelectric properties of thermoelectric materials at room temperature. In 2022, they found that incorporating polyaniline nanoparticles into the BTS matrix could enhance phonon scattering and reduce the lattice thermal conductivity by 49% at 300K.\"It results in an 8% increase in power factor and a maximum ZTmax of 1.22 at 345K for the 1.5 wt% composite sample,\" said Chen Tao, a member of the team, \"which is an attempt of organic compound, and also for the later inorganic-organic compound system research to lay a certain foundation.\" More information:Shuhuan Yang et al, Enhanced phonon scattering and thermoelectric performance for N-type Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 through incorporation of conductive polyaniline particles, Chemical Engineering Journal (2022).

  "text": "Processes inside human cells are tightly regulated in time and space by various enzymes and proteins. However, if processes become unbalanced\u2014for example, because cells experience increased stress\u2014these processes can also lead to diseases.          For example, proteins can \"aggregate\"\u2014that is, cluster together and form extended, ordered, straight fibers, similar to a Mikado. While most proteins have a well-defined three-dimensional structure, some exist in cells without any structure, like a long string.This category of proteins is called intrinsically disordered. Recently such intrinsically disordered proteins have received considerable attention as driving cellular organization and have been linked to neurodegeneration. However, it is unclear how these disordered and flexible proteins become structured to build the Mikado.A team of researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research and the University of Texas has now shown that interfaces can trigger aggregation of a model intrinsically disordered protein\u2014called FUS (fused in sarcoma). This disordered protein is flexible in the bulk, but at a hydrophobic interface, it forms fibers. These FUS proteins form connected \"Mikado-networks \" that cannot be easily broken down and may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.\"We looked at the formation of FUS fibers at the hydrophobic interface using laser-based methods including spectroscopy and microscopy,\" say Mischa Bonn and Yuki Nagata. The researchers observed the formation of fibers through the collective ordered assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins. The researchers further showed that protein mobility was dramatically reduced upon fiber formation: the proteins are stuck in the fibers they form.\"We were able to demonstrate that hydrophobic interfaces\u2014for example, small oily droplets in cells\u2014can seed molecular ordering and fiber formation,\" explains Sapun Parekh, also a group leader in Mischa Bonn's department and a professor at the University of Austin, Texas. \"This formation happens at surprisingly low concentrations: concentrations 600 times lower than necessary for forming loose protein clusters in solution,\" Parekh adds.The scientists hope their research will contribute to future understanding of how neurodegenerative diseases develop.

  "text": "A breakthrough in fluorescence microscopy has been achieved by the research group of Ralf Jungmann at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry (MPIB) and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t (LMU) Munich. The team developed Resolution Enhancement by Sequential Imaging (RESI), a revolutionary technique that enhances the resolution of fluorescence microscopy down to the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m scale. This innovation is poised to usher in a paradigm shift in our approach to study biological systems with thus far unprecedented detail.          Cells, the fundamental units of life, contain a plethora of intricate structures, processes and mechanisms that uphold and perpetuate living systems. Many cellular core components, such as DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids, are just a few nanometers in size. This makes them substantially smaller than the resolution limit of traditional light microscopy. The exact composition and arrangement of these molecules and structures is thus often unknown, resulting in a lack of mechanistic understanding of fundamental aspects of biology.In recent years, super-resolution techniques have made leaps and bounds to resolve many sub-cellular structures below the classical diffraction limit of light. Single molecule localization microscopy, or SMLM, is a super-resolution approach that can resolve structures on the order of ten nanometers in size by temporally separating their individual fluorescence emission.As individual targets stochastically light up (they blink) in an otherwise dark field of view, their location can be determined with sub-diffraction precision. DNA-PAINT, invented by the Jungmann group, is a SMLM technique that uses transient hybridization of dye-labeled DNA \"imager\" strands to their target-bound complements to achieve the necessary blinking for super-resolution. However, to date, even DNA-PAINT has not been able to resolve the smallest cellular structures.In the current study, published in Nature and led by co-first authors Susanne Reinhardt, Luciano Masullo, Isabelle Baudrexel and Philipp Steen together with Jungmann, the team introduces a novel approach in super-resolution microscopy that enables fundamentally \"unlimited\" spatial resolution.The new technique, called resolution enhancement by sequential imaging, or RESI for short, capitalizes on the ability of DNA-PAINT to encode target identity via unique DNA sequences. By labeling adjacent targets, too close to each other to be resolved even by super-resolution microscopy, with different DNA strands, an additional degree of differentiation (a barcode) is introduced into the sample. By sequentially imaging first one, and then the other sequence (and thereby target), they can now be unambiguously separated.      Critically, as they are imaged sequentially, the targets can be arbitrarily close to each other, something no other technique can resolve. Furthermore, RESI does not require specialized instrumentation, in fact, it can be applied using any standard fluorescence microscope, making it easily accessible for almost all researchers.To demonstrate RESI's leap in resolution, the team set themselves the challenge of resolving one of the smallest spatial distances in a biological system: The separation between individual bases along a double helix of DNA, spaced less than one nanometer apart.By designing a DNA origami nanostructure such that it presents single-stranded DNA sequences that protrude from a double helix at one base pair distance and then imaging these single strands sequentially, the research team resolved a distance of 0.85 nm (or 8.5 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m) between adjacent bases, a previously unimaginable feat. The researchers accomplished these measurements with a precision of 1 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m, or one 10-billionth of a meter, underscoring the unprecedented capabilities of the RESI approach.Importantly, the technique is universal and not limited to applications in DNA nanostructures. To this end, the team investigated the molecular mode of action of Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that was first approved in 1997 for treatment of CD20-positive blood cancer. However, investigating the effects of such drug molecules on molecular receptor patterns has been beyond the spatial resolution capabilities of traditional microscopy techniques. Understanding whether and how such patterns change in health and disease as well as upon treatment is not only important for basic mechanistic research, but also for designing novel targeted disease therapies.Using RESI, Jungmann and his team were able to reveal the natural arrangement of CD20 receptors in untreated cells as dimers and uncover how CD20 re-arranged to chains of dimers upon drug treatment. The insights on the single-protein level now help to shed light on the molecular mode of action of Rituximab.As RESI is performed in whole, intact cells, the technique closes the gap between purely structural techniques such as X-ray crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy and traditional lower resolution whole-cell imaging approaches. Jungmann and his team are convinced that \"this unprecedented technique is a true game-changer not only for super-resolution, but for biological research as a whole.\" More information:Susanne C. M.

  "text": "In aerobic organisms, reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxide (OH), singlet oxygen (1O2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and superoxide (O2\u2013) ions are produced during aerobic respiration, which causes serious oxidative damage to biomolecules in the body. Hence, the removal of ROS, particularly O2\u2013, is of primary importance as it reacts with H+ to produce other toxic ROS species like H2O2 and OH.          This is achieved by metalloenzymes called superoxide dismutases (SODs). These enzymes possess metal ions (like Ni, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn) in their active centers that catalyze the decomposition of O2\u2013 to H2O2 and O2. In this regard, low molecular weight Cu(II) complexes have gained importance as functional SOD models that exhibit high SOD activity. However, they are limited by their tendency to become toxic to the biomolecules after the release of Cu(II).In a recent study, a group of researchers led by Assistant Professor Daisuke Nakane and Professor Takashiro Akitsu from the Department of Chemistry, Tokyo University of Science (TUS), has developed a novel metal-protein hybrid complex with enhanced ROS activity. They coupled the hydrolytic enzyme lysozyme with SOD-active Cu(II) complex to form the hybrid lysozyme CuST@lysozyme, which showed promising SOD activity but low biotoxicity.\"We investigated the formation of a hybrid protein composed of lysozyme and a functional SOD-mimetic Cu(II) complex. We chose lysozyme owing to its stability and crystallinity. We theorized that the resulting SOD-mimetic hybrid protein would improve the biocompatibility and stability of the functional SOD model Cu(II) complex,\" explains Dr. Nakane as the rationale behind their study. The study was published on in Scientific Reports.Through detailed crystallographic and spectroscopic analysis, the research team, which also comprised Assistant Professor Kenichi Kitanishi from TUS, Dr. Arshak Tsaturyan from Southern Federal University, and Professor Masaki Unno from Ibaraki University, among others, confirmed the formation of the hybrid protein CuST@lysozyme, and elucidated its structure.They report that the His15 imidazole group of the lysozyme binds to the Cu(II) center of  CuST  in the equatorial position while the CuST unit is fixed axially by several weak coordination and hydrogen bonds. Further they also suggest that O2\u2013 can coordinate to the Cu(II) center. Through assays, the researchers established high SOD activity and stability of the biocompatible CuST@lysozyme hybrid protein complex.Based on their spectroscopic and quantum calculations, the team propose a five-step mechanism of O2\u2013 disproportionation by the complex. These steps are (1) Cu(II) resting state, (2) O2\u2013-binding Cu(II) state, (3) Cu(I) resting state after protonation of the carboxylate ligand, (4) O2\u2013-interacted Cu(I) state, and (5) H2O2-interacted Cu(II) state.They further suggest that the stability of the complex can be improved by suppressing ligand dissociation by using late-transition-metal complexes for binding lysozyme, increasing interaction between the complexes and lysozyme by using ligands with hydrogen-bonding moieties, and introducing acidic functional groups to counter the basic side chains of lysozyme.The study introduces a new class of SOD active hybrid protein complexes that are biocompatible and have no side reactions with bodily fluids after decomposition of the mimetic complex. \"We have strategically improved the stability of the metal\u2013lysozyme composites, specifically in biological fluids such as plasma and cytosol. This should pave the way for deeper discussions on their therapeutic applications,\" concludes Prof. Akitsu.

  "text": "Scientists at McMaster University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have used artificial intelligence to discover a new antibiotic that could be used to fight a deadly, drug-resistant pathogen that strikes vulnerable hospital patients.          The process they used could also speed the discovery of other antibiotics to treat many other challenging bacteria.The researchers were responding to the urgent need for new drugs to treat Acinetobacter baumannii, identified by the World Health Organization as one of the world's most dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Notoriously difficult to eradicate, A. baumannii can cause pneumonia, meningitis and infect wounds, all of which can lead to death.A. baumanni is usually found in hospital settings, where it can survive on surfaces for long periods. The pathogen is able to pick up DNA from other species of bacteria in its environment, including antibiotic-resistance genes.In the study, published today in the journal Nature Chemical Biology, researchers report they used an artificial intelligence algorithm to predict new structural classes of antibacterial molecules, and identified a new antibacterial compound, which they have named abaucin.Discovering new antibiotics against A. baumannii through conventional screening has been challenging. Traditional methods are time-consuming, costly, and limited in scope.Modern algorithmic approaches can access hundreds of millions, possibly billions, of molecules with antibacterial properties.

  "text": "Danish painters in the 19th century may have turned to an unusual source for some of their supplies: breweries.          Researchers examined paintings from the Danish Golden Age and found traces of yeast and grains. That suggests painters were turning to byproducts from local breweries to prepare canvases, they reported Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.Study author Cecil Krarup Andersen said they went into the project looking for glue made from animals.\"Then, by surprise, we found something completely different,\" said Andersen, a paintings conservator at the Royal Danish Academy.The brewing leftovers would have been spread over the canvases as a paste, creating a smooth surface and preventing the paint from seeping through, Andersen explained. Today, this priming process is usually done with a white mixture known as gesso.The authors said that knowing what's on the canvases will help in conserving them.In the study, scientists took a look at works by two of the first master painters to come out of Denmark\u2014Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, considered the father of Danish painting, and Christen Schiellerup Kobke.To get a peek underneath their scenes of bobbing ships and family portraits, researchers used pieces of canvas that had been trimmed off the paintings in an earlier conservation project.

Instead, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, which prepared canvases for its artists, likely bought leftover mash from local breweries.This kind of recycling wasn't uncommon, Andersen added: Artists also used bits of sails for their canvases and boiled leather scraps for their glue. Records from the time also suggested that beer products may have been used in the arts.

  "text": "What does a traditional West African dish have to do with road salt spread across snowy Canadian streets every winter?          The two subjects are equal passions for chemistry Ph.D. candidate Robert Addai, who works in Western's Material Science Addition lab and studies how metals corrode when they come into contact with food and road salts.It all started with fufu, a common staple in his diet growing up in Ghana. A starchy food that's common in West African cuisine, traditionally fufu is made by pounding cassava, a tropical root vegetable. That labor-intensive process can take hours.The preparation of fufu has evolved, the same way butter and other food staples have become almost exclusively machine produced. Most people now use a metal \"fufu pounding machine\" that offers the repetitive pounding action in a hands-free form, Addai explained.\"It is a delicious food, but it takes a lot of time. The machines also works in the form of friction, by pounding. My research is focused on whether metals are released from the machine into the fufu,\" Addai said.Addai measures the chromium, iron, manganese and nickel present in samples of fufu, by testing a slurry of the food in contact with samples of two types of carefully cleaned stainless steel. After breaking it down in a digester, he analyzes the solution for trace amounts of metals using a specialized tool to quantify metal ions. After reviewing initial results, he found the highest concentrations of iron followed by manganese, chromium and nickel.Addai tests fufu made from powder, cassava flour, which is the most common preparation for those making the food in Canada, as well as some homemade samples of traditional fufu made by machine.His samples are tested after 30 minutes, 24 hours and one week, since fufu can be cooked for various lengths of time. The release of metals increases with time, Addai has found. In some samples, there are potentially harmful levels of nickel and chromium, which have been linked to possible health effects such as respiratory and cardiovascular issues, as well as some types of cancer.Health concerns originally sparked Addai's interest. He wanted to know if the metals in contact with food enjoyed by his friends and family were playing a role in rates of illness.      \"There are a lot of people, not only in Ghana, but all over the world, especially in the diaspora who are suffering from cancer, heart disease and other illness. Scientifically, we don't always know the cause. So I wanted to study this (food preparation) from the start to check if some of the diseases are coming from this food,\" he said.There are other concerns, too, such as the type of metal used to create the fufu machines.\"They use recycled materials, that can contain a lot of lead,\" said chemistry professor Yolanda Hedberg, Addai's supervisor. She conducts similar research testing for the prevalence of metals in dairy products.Addai's deep dive into fufu led him to similar research on metal corrosion in an environment far from a Ghanaian kitchen: an icy Canadian road.Hedberg needed a researcher to work on a new project in the Material Science Addition lab. Addai had the knowledge and the willingness to jump in, Hedberg said.In addition to investigating metals in contact with fufu, Addai is now looking at different brands of road salt used for melting and grip on the roadways in Canada's coldest months. Despite straddling two seemingly disparate fields\u2014from fufu to road salts\u2014Addai conducts the same kind of core research in both projects.Last winter, Addai began running tests on the same squares of stainless steel he used for his cassava research. This time, they were laid out in a parking lot of Western Research Parks for a small pilot project. The metal was left outside for two months and monitored as it was sprayed weekly with nine different varieties of road salt.Addai will continue that work next winter, along with other researchers, to look at the environmental effects of popular types of road salt, including the type used by Western's facilities management team.\"We hope to recommend the best product, to balance effectiveness with environmental impact,\" he said.Addai said it can sometimes be tedious to wait for the results of his studies, many of which undergo multiple stages and phases. It takes time to reach the stage of final analysis.But challenges in examining the tiniest particles of fufu haven't dimmed his enthusiasm for the subject\u2014or the food.Addai is traveling home to Ghana soon and said he can't wait to enjoy the fufu made by his loved ones, instead of the version he makes in Canada using cassava flour.\"I told my family, have the fufu ready,\" Addai said with a laugh. \"It's the first thing I want to do. I miss it so much.\" Provided byUniversity of Western OntarioCitation:From beloved West African cuisine to Canadian road salt, corrosion study opens new path (2023, May 24)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-beloved-west-african-cuisine-canadian.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The increasingly inferior quality of heavy oil resources has brought more difficult challenges to traditional heavy oil processing technology. The high temperature and pressure conditions, and the carbon emission and energy consumption required to convert heavy oil to value-added chemicals are far from ideal.          Plasma technology is a potential approach to tackle this problem without catalysts, high-temperature and high-pressure conditions during the reaction. It also has advantages of short process flow, low carbon emissions and wide material adaptability. However, this technology is complicated due to the inert nature of heavy oil.Researchers led by Prof. Shao Tao from the Institute of Electrical Engineering (IEE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and their collaborators have explored the conversion laws and reaction mechanisms of plasma-enabled heavy oil conversion using different types of pulsed discharge plasma, and converted heavy oil into acetylene, carbon materials or cycloalkanes.Their research findings have been published in the Chemical Engineering Journal with the titles \"Catalyst-free toluene hydrogenation to methyl-cyclohexane by pulsed DBD plasma under ambient conditions\" and \"One-step high-value conversion of heavy oil into H2, C2H2 and carbon nanomaterials by non-thermal plasma.\"With microsecond pulsed spark discharge plasma, the researchers investigated heavy oil cracking characteristics in terms of pulse voltage, pulse repetition frequency and discharge power. Emission spectral analysis revealed the rapid heating and cooling mechanism of the pulsed spark plasma.They achieved one-step cracking of heavy oil into acetylene, hydrogen and nano-carbon materials, with heavy oil conversion rate of 50.4%, acetylene yield of 19.7%, and energy consumption of 55.4 kWh/m3.

Credit: IEE             Moreover, using pulsed dielectric barrier discharge plasma, the researchers realized non-catalytic aromatics hydrogenation to cycloalkanes at mild conditions, which has broken the limitation of catalysts and harsh conditions in conventional heavy oil processing.Isotope conversion experiment and density functional theory calculation revealed the mechanism and kinetic process of hydrogen radical hydrogenation, which has laid a foundation for the study of plasma mass oil hydrogenation process.

  "text": "Designing the next generation of efficient energy conversion devices for powering our electronics and heating our homes requires a detailed understanding of how molecules move and vibrate while undergoing light-induced chemical reactions.          Researchers at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have now visualized the distortions of chemical bonds in a methane molecule after it absorbs light, loses an electron, and then relaxes. Their study provides insights into how molecules react to light, which can ultimately be useful for developing new methods to control chemical reactions.Examining how a molecule responds to light on extremely fast timescales allows researchers to track how electrons move during a chemical reaction. \"The big question is how a molecule dissipates energy without breaking apart,\" said Enrico Ridente, a physicist at Berkeley Lab and lead author on the Science paper reporting the work. This means examining how excess energy is redistributed in a molecule that has been excited by light, as the electrons and nuclei move about while the molecule relaxes to an equilibrium state.Probing these fine-scale movements means making observations of processes that occur on timescales faster than a millionth of a billionth of a second. For decades, researchers have relied on theory to describe how excess energy affects the symmetry of\u2014but does not break\u2014the bonds of a molecule that's been excited by light. This theory predicts how the bond lengths and angles between individual atoms should change while electrons shift position, and what intermediate structures it should adopt.Now, using ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy facilities at Berkeley Lab's Chemical Sciences Division, Ridente and his colleagues observed how the structure of ionized methane molecules evolves over time.\"Methane ions are an ideal system to address this question because they do not come apart when excited by light,\" said Ridente.The angles between atoms in an excited methane molecule change as the molecule relaxes, distorting its shape and redistributing the absorbed energy. Credit: Diptarka Hait/Berkeley LabBy first using a laser to strip an electron from the neutral methane molecule, then taking ultrafast X-ray spectroscopic snapshots of the remaining ion, the researchers collected a time series of spectral signals. The signals revealed how the initially symmetric shape becomes distorted over a ten-femtosecond period (a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second)\u2014observational evidence of a long-studied effect called Jahn-Teller distortion.      Longer time observations showed that for another 58 femtoseconds, the distorted shape vibrates coherently in a scissoring-like motion while redistributing its energy via other vibrations through the structure's geometric changes.\"Thanks to these measurements and the understanding gained from theory, we were able to time-resolve the full evolution of the distortion for the first time,\" said Stephen Leone, a chemist at Berkeley Lab and the senior author on the Science paper.The researchers used the Cori and Perlmutter systems at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a DOE Office of Science user facility at Berkeley Lab, to perform calculations that confirmed their measurements of the molecule's movements.\"We can now explain how the molecule distorts after losing an electron and how the energies of the electrons respond to these changes,\" said Diptarka Hait, a graduate student at Berkeley Lab and the lead theoretical author of the study.The study demonstrated the viability of an X-ray approach for studying ultrafast molecular dynamics. Methane is a fundamental yet simple molecule where one of the most basic types of distortions occurs as predicted, but with richer and more complicated dynamics than previously understood.\"This research opens the door for studying more complex systems and other types of distortions,\" says Ridente. Such insights about the dynamics of electrons and nuclei can lead to innovations in new energy conversion devices and photocatalysis applications.

  "text": "Prof. Liang Haojun from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) proposed a new catalytic assembly approach to escape from metastable states in a far-from-equilibrium system of DNA-functionalized colloids. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.          Self-assembly refers to the process in which assembled primitive elements (molecules, nanoparticles, etc.) spontaneously form ordered structures through non-covalent interactions. The excellent capacity of the system to create new materials has drawn attention. In an ideal assembly process, the system will reach a thermodynamically stable state with the lowest free energy and form a high-quality assembly structure. However, for the assembly system far away from the equilibrium state, the system is prone to be stuck in metastability where the local free energy is extremely small, blocking the formation of a high-quality assembly structure.How to circumvent metastability in a far-from-equilibrium system is regarded as a challenging conundrum in the field of self-assembly. For DNA-functionalized nanoparticle assembly, a typical far-from-equilibrium system, the entropy-controlled thermal annealing strategy constitutes a traditional and generally adopted way to escape from metastability. Nevertheless, the aggregation and dispersion of nanoparticles usually occur over a narrow temperature span during annealing. In correcting misconnected non-covalent bonds, thermal energy is not selective. Thermal annealing is not conducive to the assembly of biologically active particles or under physiological conditions.Inspired by the concept of \"catassembly\" proposed by academician Tian Zhongqun from Xiamen University, Prof. Liang and his team presented a new way to achieve catalytic-assembly of DNA-functionalized colloidal nanoparticles in a far-from-equilibrium system. Based on their prediction on theoretical simulation and previous research results on constant enthalpy control strategy for nanoparticle assembly, they employed a removable molecule named a \"catassembler,\" which serves as a catalyst, to adjust imperfect linkages and assist the system to escape from metastability while preserving assembled framework.In this strategy, the short DNA strand acting as the accelerator has a direct competitive effect with the bonding end on the surface of the nanoparticles inside the assembly structure, and the non-covalent bond of the wrong connection could be corrected by the transient DNA strand replacement reaction, assisting the system to escape from the metastability. During the process, the accelerator would not destroy the overall skeleton of the assembly structure, and it could be removed from the final assembly structure. Moreover, by changing the structural design of the accelerator, it could even reduce the dosage of the accelerator and improve its efficiency.On the basis of the same principle, superlattice structures with different crystal symmetries can be obtained by changing the kernel type of nanoparticles in a two-component system and directly adding the corresponding DNA accelerator after the design of the DNA sequence. This strategy makes the implementation of the assembly of nanoparticles easy to carry out as the chemical reaction occurs at a constant temperature.Furthermore, this DNA accelerator regulation strategy is simple and effective enough that the \"solid\u2013solid\" phase transformation between different colloidal crystals becomes easier to achieve, after breaking through the constraints of the temperature regulation and the initial phase state free energy. It displays its application potential in structurally reconfigurable \"solid\u2013solid\" phase transformation bio-inorganic composites.As a general method for regulating non-covalent interactions within assembly structures, the accelerator strategy proposed in this study is expected to be extended to the controlling and devising of assembly processes for other soft material systems (polypeptides, block copolymers, etc.) that are far from equilibrium.

  "answer_race": " New way to make diamond rotors",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the MIT graduate student who worked on the Killian Award Committee?",
  "answer_squad": " Natalie Golota",
  "text": "Many of the biological materials that researchers are most interested in studying, including those associated with major diseases, don't lend themselves to the conventional methods that researchers typically use to probe a material's structure and chemistry.          One technique, called magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, or MAS-NMR, has proven highly successful as a way of determining the properties of complex molecules such as some proteins. But the resolution achievable with such systems depends on the spinning frequency of tiny rotors, and these systems have bumped up against limits imposed by the rotor materials.Most such devices used today rely on rotors made of yttria-stabilized zirconia, which are as thin as a pin. Such rotors fall apart if spun much faster than a few million revolutions per minute, limiting the materials that can be studied with such systems. But now, researchers at MIT have developed a method for making these tiny, precise rotors out of pure diamond crystal, whose much greater strength could allow it to spin at far higher frequencies. The advance opens the door to studying a wide variety of important molecules, including those found in the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease.The new method is described in the Journal of Magnetic Resonance, in a paper by MIT graduate students Natalie Golota, Zachary Fredin, Daniel Banks, and David Preiss; professors Robert Griffin, Neil Gershenfeld, and Keith Nelson; and seven others at MIT.The MAS-NMR technique, Gershenfeld says, \"is the tool of choice for [analyzing] complex biological proteins in biologically meaningful environments.\" For example, a sample could be analyzed in a liquid environment as opposed to being dried out or crystallized or coated for examination. \"Only [solid-state] NMR does it in the ambient chemical environment,\" he says.The basic method has existed for decades, Griffin explains, and involves placing a tiny cylinder filled with the material to be studied into a magnetic field where it can be suspended and spun up to high frequencies using jets of gas, usually nitrogen, and then zapped with radio-frequency pulses to determine key properties of the material. The term \"magic angle\" refers to the fact that if the cylinder containing the sample spins at one precise angle (54.74 degrees) relative to the applied magnetic field, various sources of broadening of the spectral lines are attenuated and a much higher-resolution spectrum is possible.                These tiny rotors could make it possible to use magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, or MAS-NMR, to determine the structural and chemical properties of certain complex biological molecules. Credit: Massachusetts Institute of Technology             But the resolution of these spectra is directly limited by how fast the tiny cylinders, or rotors, can spin before they shatter. Over the years, early versions were made of various plastics, then later ceramic materials were used, and finally zirconium, \"which is the material of choice that most rotors are made of these days,\" Griffin says.Such MAS-NMR systems are widely used in biochemical research as a tool for studying the molecular structure, down to the level of individual atoms, of materials including proteins that are difficult or impossible to probe using other standard lab methods. These include not only amyloid fibrils, but membrane proteins and some viral assemblies. But some of the most pressing challenges in both biomedical and materials science lie just beyond reach of the resolution of today's MAS-NMR systems.\"As we progressed to spinning frequencies above 100 kilohertz,\" equivalent to 6 million revolutions per minute, Griffin says, \"these rotors have become very problematic. They fail about 50% of the time\u2014and you lose a sample, and it destroys the NMR coil.\" The team decided to tackle the problem, which many said at the time was impossible, of making the rotors out of single crystal diamond.Even the company making the laser system they used thought it couldn't be done, and it took years of work by an interdisciplinary team, involving students and researchers at both MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms and the Department of Chemistry, to solve that fabrication problem. (The collaboration grew out of Griffin and Gershenfeld serving on MIT's Killian Award Committee). They developed a kind of laser-based lathe system that rapidly spins a piece of diamond while zapping it with the laser, essentially vaporizing its outer layers until a perfectly smooth cylinder remains, just 0.7 millimeters across (about 1/36 inch). Then, the same laser is used to drill a perfectly centered hole through the middle of the cylinder, leaving a sort of drinking-straw shape.\"It's not obvious it would work,\" Gershenfeld says, \"but the laser turns the diamond into graphite and drives the carbon off, and you can incrementally do that to drill deep into the diamond.\"This shows the process of making a hollow cylinder out of a block of diamond. The diamond spins while a laser beam burns off its outer layers and its interior. Credit: Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyThe diamond emerges from the machining process with a black coating of pure graphite, but the MIT researchers found that this could be eliminated by heating the rotor overnight at about 600\u00b0C (about 1,100\u00b0F.) The result is a rotor that can already spin at 6 million revolutions per minute, the speed of the best zirconia rotors, and has other advantageous characteristics as well, including extremely high thermal conductivity and radio-frequency transparency.Fredin points out that all the parts needed to make this high-precision machining system \"were all designed and fabricated right here\" in a basement lab in the Center for Bits and Atoms. \"To be able to physically design and make everything and iterate it many times a day in-house was a crucial aspect of this project, as opposed to having to send things out to outside machine shops.\"Achieving much higher spinning frequencies should now be possible with these new rotors, the researchers say, but will require the development of new bearings and new systems based on helium rather than nitrogen to drive the rotation, in order to achieve the increased speeds and the corresponding leap in resolution. \"It was never worth it to develop these helium-compatible bearings for these small rotors until this technology was proven out, when the rotors previously used would not be able to withstand the spinning speeds,\" which could end up going as high as 20 million revolutions per minute, Golota says.Such high rotation rates are almost unheard of outside the NMR field. Preiss says that as a mechanical engineer, \"it's rare that you'd encounter something spinning above tens of thousands of rpm.\" When he first heard the 6 million rpm figure for these devices, he says, \"I kind of thought it was a joke.\"Because of these high speeds, Gershenfeld says, instabilities can easily arise from any imperfection: \"If there's even a slight asymmetry in the structure, at these frequencies, you're doomed.\"Golota says that in her experiments using current zirconia rotors, \"when the rotors fail, they explode, and you essentially just recover dust. But when the diamond rotors fail, we were able to recover them intact. So, you're saving the sample as well, which can be an invaluable resource to the user.\"                A microscope view of a tube-shaped diamond rotor seen from one end, showing the precise round shape and perfectly aligned central opening. Because the rotors spin at such high speeds, Neil Gershenfeld says, instabilities can easily arise from any imperfection. \"If there's even a slight asymmetry in the structure, at these frequencies, you're doomed.\" Credit: Massachusetts Institute of Technology             They have already used the new diamond rotor to produce the carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 spectra of a small peptide, clearly demonstrating the capabilities of the new diamond rotor material, which Griffin says is the first new material for such rotors to be developed in the last three decades. \"We've used spectra like these extensively,\" he says, \"to determine the structure of amyloid-beta 1-42, which is a toxic species in Alzheimer's disease.\"Samples of such material are hard to get and usually obtainable only in tiny quantities, he says. \"We now have a small rotor that's going to be hopefully very reliable where you can put in two or three milligrams of material and get spectral data like these,\" he says, pointing to the sample data they obtained. \"It's really exciting and it's going to open up a lot of new areas of research.\"This work \"is truly remarkable,\" says David Doty, president of Doty Scientific, a maker of NMR systems, who was not involved in this work. \"It would have been very hard to find anyone outside this group who would have thought it possible to laser machine diamond rotors with the precision needed for fast-MAS, prior to actually seeing it work,\" he says.Doty adds, \"What they have demonstrated thus far \u2026 is nothing short of amazing. If the additional needed progress can be made, hundreds of NMR researchers will want these to help them get better data for the projects they are working on, from improving our understanding of some diseases and developing better drugs to developing advanced battery materials.\"\"This new technology has the potential to be a game-changer in the way we will carry out solid-state NMR experiments in the future, opening unprecedented experimental opportunities in terms of resolution and sensitivity,\" says Anne Lesage, adjunct director of the institute of analytical sciences at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Lyon, France, who also was not associated with this work.

  "text": "Researchers in Japan have developed a machine learning process that simultaneously designs new molecules and suggests the chemical reactions needed to make them. The team at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM) in Tokyo published their results in the journal Science and Technology of Advanced Materials: Methods.          Many research groups are making significant progress in using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods to design feasible molecular structures with desired properties, but progress in putting the design concepts into practice has been slow. The greatest impediment has been the technical difficulties in finding chemical reactions that can make the designed molecules with efficiencies and costs that could be practicable for real-world uses.\"Our novel machine learning algorithm and associated software system can design molecules with any desired properties and suggest synthetic routes for making them from an extensive list of commercially available compounds,\" says statistical mathematician Ryo Yoshida, leader of the research group.The process uses a statistical approach called Bayesian inference, which works with a vast set of data about different options for starting materials and reaction pathways. The possible starting materials are all combinations of the millions of compounds that can be readily purchased. The computer algorithm assesses the huge range of feasible reactions and reaction networks to discover a synthetic route towards a compound with the properties it has been instructed to aim for. Expert chemists can then review the results to test and refine what the AI proposes. AI makes the suggestions while humans decide which is best.\"In a case study for designing drug-like molecules, the method showed overwhelming performance,\" says Yoshida. It also designed routes towards industrially useful lubricant molecules.\"We hope that our work will accelerate the process of data-driven discovery of a wide range of new materials,\" Yoshida concludes. In support of this aim, the ISM team has made the software implementing their machine learning system available to all researchers on the GitHub website.The current success focused only on the design of small molecules. The team now plan to investigate adapting the procedure to design polymers. Many of the most important industrial and biological compounds are polymers, but it has proved difficult to make new versions proposed by machine learning due to challenges in finding reactions to build the designs. The simultaneous design and reaction discovery options offered by this new technology might break through that barrier.

  "text": "A team of researchers at Duke University and their collaborators have uncovered the atomic mechanisms that make a class of compounds called argyrodites attractive candidates for both solid-state battery electrolytes and thermoelectric energy converters.          The discoveries\u2014and the machine learning approach used to make them\u2014could help usher in a new era of energy storage for applications such as household battery walls and fast-charging electric vehicles.The results appeared online May 18 in the journal Nature Materials.\"This is a puzzle that has not been cracked before because of how big and complex each building block of the material is,\" said Olivier Delaire, associate professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke. \"We've teased out the mechanisms at the atomic level that are causing this entire class of materials to be a hot topic in the field of solid-state battery innovation.\"As the world moves toward a future built on renewable energy, researchers must develop new technologies for storing and distributing energy to homes and electric vehicles. While the standard bearer to this point has been the lithium-ion battery containing liquid electrolytes, it is far from an ideal solution given its relatively low efficiency and the liquid electrolyte's affinity for occasionally catching fire and exploding.These limitations stem primarily from the chemically reactive liquid electrolytes inside Li-ion batteries that allow lithium ions to move relatively unencumbered between electrodes. While great for moving electric charges, the liquid component makes them sensitive to high temperatures that can cause degradation and, eventually, a runaway thermal catastrophe.Many public and private research labs are spending a lot of time and money to develop alternative solid-state batteries out of a variety of materials. If engineered correctly, this approach offers a much safer and more stable device with a higher energy density\u2014at least in theory.While nobody has yet discovered a commercially viable approach to solid-state batteries, one of the leading contenders relies on a class of compounds called argyrodites, named after a silver containing mineral. These compounds are built from specific, stable crystalline frameworks made of two elements with a third free to move about the chemical structure. While some recipes such as silver, germanium and sulfur are naturally occurring, the general framework is flexible enough for researchers to create a wide array of combinations.      \"Every electric vehicle manufacturer is trying to move to new solid-state battery designs, but none of them are disclosing which compositions they're betting on,\" Delaire said. \"Winning that race would be a game changer because cars could charge faster, last longer and be safer all at once.\"In the new paper, Delaire and his colleagues look at one promising candidate made of silver, tin and selenium (Ag8SnSe6). Using a combination of neutrons and X-rays, the researchers bounced these extremely fast-moving particles off atoms within samples of Ag8SnSe6 to reveal its molecular behavior in real-time. Team member Mayanak Gupta, a former postdoc in Delaire's lab who is now a researcher at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in India, also developed a machine learning approach to make sense of the data and created a computational model to match the observations using first-principles quantum mechanical simulations.The results showed that while the tin and selenium atoms created a relatively stable scaffolding, it was far from static. The crystalline structure constantly flexes to create windows and channels for the charged silver ions to move freely through the material. The system, Delaire said, is like the tin and selenium lattices remain solid while the silver is in an almost liquid-like state.\"It's sort of like the silver atoms are marbles rattling around about the bottom of a very shallow well, moving about like the crystalline scaffold isn't solid,\" Delaire said. \"That duality of a material living between both a liquid and solid state is what I found most surprising.\"The results and, perhaps more importantly, the approach combining advanced experimental spectroscopy with machine learning, should help researchers make faster progress toward replacing lithium-ion batteries in many crucial applications. According to Delaire, this study is just one of a suite of projects aimed at a variety of promising argyrodite compounds comprising different recipes. One combination that replaces the silver with lithium is of particular interest to the group, given its potential for EV batteries.\"Many of these materials offer very fast conduction for batteries while being good heat insulators for thermoelectric converters, so we're systematically looking at the entire family of compounds,\" Delaire said. \"This study serves to benchmark our machine learning approach that has enabled tremendous advances in our ability to simulate these materials in only a couple of years. I believe this will allow us to quickly simulate new compounds virtually to find the best recipes these compounds have to offer.\" More information:Qingyong Ren et al, Extreme phonon anharmonicity underpins superionic diffusion and ultralow thermal conductivity in argyrodite Ag8SnSe6, Nature Materials (2023).

  "text": "Scientists have long been challenged by the complex process of drug discovery and development, with investments that often go unrewarded. However, with the advancement of experimental technology and computer hardware, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a leading tool in analyzing abundant and high-dimensional data.          In a new academic paper published in the journal Engineering titled \"Artificial Intelligence in Pharmaceutical Sciences,\" researchers detail the advantages of AI technology in all aspects of new drug research and development (R&D).AI is capable of discovering new drugs more efficiently and at a lower cost. Through the explosive growth of biomedical data, AI has led to a revolution in drug R&D, from target discovery to preclinical research, automated drug synthesis, and influences on the pharmaceutical market. In the review, the authors provide a brief overview of common AI models in the field of drug discovery, then summarize and discuss in depth their specific applications in various stages of drug R&D.The paper concludes that AI is advantageous in all aspects of new drug R&D. It can be used in the discovery of drug targets, the design and development of new drugs, preclinical research, clinical trial design, and post-market surveillance to assist in the design of safe and effective drugs.AI greatly reduces the cycle time and cost of drug R&D. While some limitations still remain in the AI-based drug R&D process, the authors believe that AI is an indispensable technology in the drug R&D process. In the future, AI technologies will change the R&D paradigm of pharmaceutical sciences, providing personalized medicine to patients.The authors of the paper propose further research to inject new energy into this field and keep the momentum going. The emergence of AI is gradually helping scientists unravel the mystery of large and complex biological systems, making it a game-changer in the drug R&D process.

  "answer_squad": " Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato",
  "text": "Approximately one in three ticks in Estonia and up to one in four in Tallinn carry bacteria that cause borreliosis. Scientists of TalTech are investigating whether medicinal plants growing in Estonia could be used to fight Lyme disease and destroy the bacteria causing it.          The arrival of warmer weather and more people spending time outdoors bring risks that should be addressed. A tick, likely to be carrying at least one pathogen, can attach itself to human skin in natural areas. The abundance of ticks in Estonia and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens have increased significantly in the last decade.The results of the recently published National Institute for Health Development project 'Mail a Tick!' show that, of the six main viruses/bacteria included in the study, at least one pathogen was detected in 62.3% of all ticks examined. The better-known tick-borne diseases include tick-borne encephalitis and borreliosis.More and more causes of Lyme diseaseIt is possible to be vaccinated against encephalitis as a viral disease; moreover, immunity develops as a result of contracting the disease. There is no preventive treatment for Lyme disease. Once infected, there is no immunity and the consequences can be severe. Lyme disease is caused by a group of bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which enter human bloodstream through tick bites.The first sign of infection is an enlarging reddish patch around the bite site, but this is absent in as many as a third of cases. According to scientific articles published in many scientific journals, such as Frontiers in Neurology, Pain, The Lancet, and Clinical Microbiology and Infection, symptoms in the later stages of the disease can include damage to joints, nervous system, skin, and heart.According to the National Institute of Health, approximately 28% of Estonian ticks are carriers of B. burgdorferi and more than 2,500 people are infected with Lyme disease each year. A comparison of the latest data with the results of surveys conducted in 2006\u20132009 and 2012\u20132014 shows that the prevalence of Lyme disease in ticks has increased two or three times in some places across Estonia.It is important to know that tick-borne diseases can also be contracted in the cities. The 2018 National Institute for Health Development survey of green areas in the capital city showed that an average 35% of ticks collected from urban areas carried at least one pathogen, with the prevalence of bacteria causing Lyme disease being as high as 25% of ticks in some places.      Innovative treatments are neededLyme disease is treated with antibiotics, which are generally effective in the acute stage of the disease. However, if the disease goes unnoticed and treatment is delayed, it can develop into a chronic condition.Persistent symptoms are caused by the more resistant forms of B. burgdorferi bacteria, namely round body forms and biofilm, which are not as sensitive to antibiotics as the bacteria in their original form\u2014corkscrew-shaped, or individual spirochetes.Novel treatments are needed to fight resistant forms of bacteria. There are many examples in research literature of the efficacy of various plant-derived compounds or phytochemicals against Lyme disease.The instrumental analysis research group of TalTech has been involved in the research of Estonian plants for a long time, and the main goal of the group in recent years has been identifying phytochemicals that are effective against B. burgdorferi and discovering new lead compounds suitable for the treatment of chronic Lyme disease.Although many Estonian plants are known as medicinal herbs with antibacterial properties, the alleged beneficial properties are often unconfirmed by scientific methods. The chemical study of Estonian plants allows identifying specific plant compounds responsible for different therapeutic properties.                Plantago lanceolata is one of the plants expected to contain phytochemicals with antibacterial properties. Credit: Pille-Riin Laanet and Merike Vaher             Which plants are studied by chemists?The instrumental analysis research group is working on a wide range of plants growing in Estonia that are more or less known as medicinal plants. As a result of the research, an overview of the chemical composition and beneficial properties of many local plant extracts will be available. The first part of the plant research focuses on the chemical characterization of the studied species, the identification of the main groups of compounds present in them, and the antioxidant properties of plant extracts.Antioxidant activity of an extract suggests its potential therapeutic uses both as an antibacterial agent and in the treatment of diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as cancers. With a suitable solvent and extraction protocol, it is possible to isolate compounds with antibacterial properties from plants, from which the researchers hope to identify the ones suitable for the treatment of Lyme disease.A detailed summary of this work can be found in a recent article published in the special issue of Molecules, which describes the identification and characterization of phytochemicals found in various Galium species growing in Estonia.Extracts of Galium verum, Galium aparine, and Galium mollugo were found to have significant antioxidant properties. The main compounds identified in the extracts belonged in the polyphenol and iridoid classes. Representatives of these classes of substances have shown a wide range of beneficial therapeutic properties in many previous scientific studies.Polyphenols are known both for the prevention and treatment of diseases related to oxidative stress and iridoids for their anti-inflammatory properties and as inhibitors of bacterial, viral, and fungal growth. An extract made from Galium verum flowers was found to have the strongest antioxidant properties. In addition, volatile compounds in Estonian Galium species were identified, of which phytochemicals found in all three plant species have been previously confirmed as inhibitors of bacterial and fungal growth.The beneficial properties of Dipsacus fullonum L. are confirmedThe research team has successfully confirmed the anti-Borrelia properties of another plant growing in Estonia, the Dipsakus fullonum L. The results of this research were published last year in a special issue of the journal Pharmaceuticals and were recognized for their importance in this field. Iridoid-glycoside fraction was isolated from the extract of the Dipsacus fullonum L. plant, which showed high activity against Borrelia and a low risk to mammalian cells.As compounds with activity against Borrelia account for about 15% of the total extract, the leaves of Dipsacus fullonum L. are an excellent natural source for extracting novel lead compounds for the treatment of Lyme disease.Plantagos and honey are also examinedScientists of the instrumental analysis research group of TalTech Merike Vaher, Piret Saar-Reismaa, Pille-Riin Laanet, Piia J\u00f5ul, and Olga Bragina will continue their work on the chemical characterization of Estonian plants and the development of suitable extraction methods for compounds with therapeutic potential.Among other things, the activity of various Plantagos and of various types of Estonian honeys and pollen against Borrelia is currently being investigated and ongoing trials have shown promising results in both cases. The researchers of TalTech hope that the results of the research could point to new treatment options for doctors and their patients, and pave the way for clinical trials to help people with chronic Lyme disease.

  "text": "A new paper published in Energy Material Advances explores Eu3+-Bi3+ codoping double perovskites for single-component white-light-emitting diodes.          \"With lead-halide perovskites reaching a mature research stage approaching product marketing, concerns remain about the materials' stability and the toxicity of lead-based salts,\" said paper author Hongwei Song, professor at College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Jilin University.Double perovskites with Cs2AgInCl6 composition, often doped with various elements, have been in the spotlight owing to their intriguing optical properties, namely, self-trapped exciton (STEs) emission and dopant-induced photoluminescence. This interest has sparked different synthesis approaches towards both crystals and nanocrystals, and the exploration of many alloy compositions with mono- and trivalent cations other than Ag+ and In3+.Song explained that, in the development of lead-free perovskite materials, people's first thought is to replace Pb element with a non-toxic element. In order to replace Pb in halide perovskite, researchers chose several low-toxic cations in the same period closest to it, such as Sn, Ge, Bi, Sb, In, etc., because they have a similar inactive shell s orbital.This is the key to the unique photoelectric properties of perovskite materials. Lead-based perovskite materials have attracted great attentions in solid-state lighting area due to their high efficiency, high color rendering and tunable luminescence performance. This is both an opportunity and a challenge for the overall development of the photoelectric industry.\"Since the pioneering work on Cs2AgInCl6 in 2017 reported by Giustino et al. and Zhou et al. nearly simultaneously, many efforts have been devoted to its synthesis, modification of its composition, study of its electronic structure, optoelectronic properties, and applications. Recently, a record of white light emission with 86 % PLQY was achieved by Luo et al. via simultaneous alloying of Ag+ with Na+ and Bi3+ doping, marking an important milestone in the development of Cs2AgInCl6 related materials,\" Song said.      \"Despite several advantages, major issues with these lead halide perovskites remain their poor stability and toxicity. In order to solve such problems, various attempts have been made to reduce the toxicity of perovskites while still maintaining their efficient optical properties.\"The existence of Bi3+ ions decrease the excitation (absorption) energy, provides a new absorption channel and increases the energy transfer rate to Eu3+ ions. Through adjusting the Bi3+ and Eu3+ concentrations, a maximum photoluminescence efficiency (PLQY) of 80.1% is obtained in 6% Eu3+ and 0.5% Bi3+ co-doped Cs2AgInCl6 DPs.\"The energy transfer efficiency can be fitted with the decay rates under different Bi3+ doping concentrations. It can be seen that the energy transfer rate improves as a whole with the increase of the doping concentration of Bi3+, and the optimum energy transfer rate corresponding to the Bi3+ concentration is 0.5%. Next, we conducted PLQY test on the materials. For the undoped Cs2AgInCl6 DPs, PLQY is only 0.5%, which dramatically increases to 20.1% after the addition of Bi3+. After [being] co-doped with Eu3+ and Bi3+ ions, PLQY continues to increase, and reaches the maximum of 80.1% when the Eu concentration reaches 6%,\" Song said.\"Here, we propose a possible mechanism to describe Eu3+ emission in Bi/Eu3+: Cs2AgInCl6. Cs2AgInCl6 DP is a direct bandgap semiconductor. Bi3+ doping provides a new absorption channel for the material, which may be caused by the contribution of the Bi3+ orbital in the band edge, breaking the STE-state compatibility ban transition, generating a new light absorption channel at a lower energy, and promoting the PLQY emitted by STE. For the Eu3+emission, we think there are two pathways. First, the energy transfer from STE to Eu3+ ions is possible as we have observed the Eu3+ emission in the Eu3+ doped Cs2AgInCl6 DPs. Second, the Eu3+ emission may mainly come from the energy transfer from Bi3+ ions to Eu3+ ions. The Bi3+ ions absorb the excitation light and transfer the energy from 1P1, 3P2, 3P1, 3P0 levels of Bi3+ ions to 5D3, 5D2, 5D1 and 5D0 levels of Eu3+ ions. The characteristic emission of Eu3+ ions is then formed through 5D0\u21927Fj(j=0,1,2,3) transitions.\"\"Finally, we prepared the white light emitting diodes based on Bi3+ and Eu3+ codoped Cs2AgInCl6 DPs were fabricated with the optimum color rendering index of 89, the optimal luminous efficiency of 88.1 lm/W and a half-lifetime of 1493 h. This strategy of imparting optical functions to metal halide DPs may lead to future applications, such as optical fiber communications, daily lighting, military industry, displays, and other fields,\" Song said.

  "text": "Most states in the U.S. allow people to use cannabis for medical or recreational purposes. Yet all states want their roadways to be safe. A breathalyzer that can accurately identify people who recently smoked cannabis might help them keep impaired drivers off the road\u2014if such a device existed.          But developing a breathalyzer for cannabis is far more difficult than for alcohol, which people exhale in large amounts when drinking. In contrast, the intoxicating component of cannabis, called THC, is thought to be carried inside aerosol particles that people exhale. The total volume of aerosols can be very small, making it difficult to accurately measure their THC content. Currently, there is no standard method for doing this.Now, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Colorado Boulder have conducted a study in which they collected breath samples from people both before and after they smoked high-THC cannabis, aka marijuana, and used laboratory instruments (not a handheld device) to measure the amount of THC in their breath.The goal of this study, published in the Journal of Breath Research, was to begin developing a protocol that yields reproducible results\u2014a necessary step toward a reliable, validated field-based method.The samples collected before people smoked were important because THC can persist in the bodies of people who frequently use cannabis for a month or more, long after the effects of the drug have worn off.\"One key question that we cannot yet answer is whether breath measurements can be used to distinguish between a person who uses cannabis regularly but hasn't done so lately, and someone who consumed an hour ago,\" said NIST supervisory chemical engineer and study author Tara Lovestead. \"Having a reproducible protocol for breath measurements will help us and other researchers answer that question.\"NIST scientists conduct foundational research on measuring THC and related compounds in the breath of people who have smoked cannabis. Their research shows that a lot of work remains before a reliable cannabis breathalyzer can be developed. Credit: National Institute of Standards and TechnologyThe breath samples were collected in a mobile lab\u2014a comfortably appointed white van that would park conveniently outside participants' homes. This mobile pharmacology lab was developed by researchers at University of Colorado Boulder, including Cinnamon Bidwell, an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience and a co-author of the study.      In addition, all participants purchased and used a consistent kind of high-THC cannabis prepared by a licensed dispensary in Boulder, Colorado. This study design allowed the authors to conduct their research without handling high-THC cannabis or otherwise running afoul of federal laws.At the appointed time, participants popped into the van, gave their pre-use breath sample and also provided a blood sample. They then went back into their residence, smoked cannabis according to their usual custom and returned immediately to the van to provide a second blood sample. Since THC concentrations in blood spike immediately after consuming the drug, researchers compared the before-and-after blood samples to confirm that the participants had in fact just used it. An hour later, the participants gave their second breath sample.Participants provided breath samples by blowing into a tube containing an \"impaction filter\" that captured aerosols from their breath. Later in the lab, the researchers extracted the material caught in the filter and measured the concentration of THC and other cannabis compounds using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, a laboratory technique that identifies compounds and measures their amount.Because this was a protocol development study that involved only 18 participants, the results of the analysis do not carry statistical weight. However, they do highlight the need for further study.\"We expected to see higher THC concentrations in the breath samples collected an hour after people used,\" Lovestead said. However, THC levels spanned a similar range across pre-use and post-use samples. \"In many cases, we would not have been able to tell whether the person smoked within the last hour based on the concentration of THC in their breath.\"\"A lot more research is needed to show that a cannabis breathalyzer can produce useful results,\" said NIST materials research engineer and co-author Kavita Jeerage. \"A breathalyzer test can have a huge impact on a person's life, so people should have confidence that the results are accurate.\" More information:Kavita M Jeerage et al, THC in breath aerosols collected with an impaction filter device before and after legal-market product inhalation\u2014a pilot study, Journal of Breath Research (2023).

  "text": "For pharmaceuticals, knowing the chemical composition is not enough\u2014molecular geometry and crystal structure also play an important role in a drug's activity. By using a method based on electron diffraction, it has now been possible for a research team to determine the structure of Levocetirizine, as reported in the journal Angewandte Chemie. The advantage of this technique is that, unlike for X-ray crystallography, nanoscale crystals are sufficient.          Despite being chemically identical, many pharmaceutical substances may adopt different crystal structures or form cocrystals with an additive. This can significantly influence the properties of a drug, such as bioavailability, solubility, stability, and tabletability. Structural determinations are correspondingly important in the development of advanced solid pharmaceuticals.Today, the standard and routine method for determining the three-dimensional structures of crystalline molecules and biological macromolecules with atomic resolution is single-crystal X-ray diffraction structure analysis (SCXRD). The atoms within the crystal diffract the X-ray radiation, forming a diffraction pattern from which the positions of the individual atoms in the structure of the crystal can be calculated. This requires sufficiently large, well-diffracting single crystals.However, many compounds are difficult or impossible to crystallize. An alternative method is powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), which can analyze a sample in the form of a powder. However, the data analysis is not straightforward and if the sample is a mixture of several phases of the same or different compounds, it is very difficult and often ambiguous.A more recent technique is 3D-electron diffraction/micro-crystal diffraction (3D ED/MicroED). Instead of X-rays, electron beams from an electron microscope are diffracted. Because the interaction of matter with electrons is significantly stronger than interactions with X-rays, sub-micro to nanometer-sized crystals produce diffraction patterns that can be evaluated and direct analysis of components in microcrystalline mixtures becomes possible.A team led by Durga Prasad Karothu and Pan\u010de Naumov has used 3D ED/MicroED to determine the structure of Levocetirizine dihydrochloride. Levocetirizine is an over-the-counter oral antihistamine used to treat allergy symptoms such as hay fever and hives. Although it has been in broad use, its crystal structure has remained unknown because no crystals good enough for X-ray crystallographic analysis could be grown. Recently, the structure of this medication was studied using powder X-ray diffraction and computer calculations\u2014but uncertainty and ambiguity remained.The team at New York University Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates), Rigaku Europe SE (Neu-Isenburg, Germany), and New York University (New York, U.S.) worked with crystals obtained by grinding commercially available tablets. In addition to determining the drug's crystal structure, they were able to use a special evaluation process (dynamical refinement) to unambiguously determine the absolute configuration (the exact spatial arrangement of all atoms within the molecule) of Levocetirizine.

  "text": "How short is one second? The duration of a second can be defined as one 86,400th of a 24-hour day. A bullet train traveling at 300 km per hour can cover a distance of 83 meters in one second. On average, an individual's blink lasts for 0.3 seconds, allowing for three blinks to occur within one second. A joint team of researchers from POSTECH has proposed a synthesis method for fluorine-based compound via a rapid mixing reaction between a gaseous component and liquid that takes less than a single second.          The research team led by Professor Dong-Pyo Kim and Jeong-Un Joo (Department of Chemical Engineering at POSTECH), and Professor Heejin Kim and Hyune-Jea Lee (currently, a researcher at Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology) from the Department of Chemistry at Korea University has successfully developed a new method for synthesizing trifluoromethyl intermediate (-CF3) from fluoroform (CHF3).It involves the use of a special reactor capable of achieving an ultra-fast mixing between gas and liquid. This method offers promising prospects for the synthesis of novel fluorine-based new drugs. The research was published in Nature Communications.Fluorine is not found in its pure form naturally, but instead exists solely in the form of various chemical compounds. Sodium fluoride, a compound containing fluorine, is used as an ingredient in toothpaste due to its ability to coat teeth and prevent cavities.Recent studies have highlighted the potential of synthetic drug molecules containing fluorine as they possess high permeability into cell membranes of diseased tissues and exhibit strong binding affinity against proteins. Consequently, there is growing interest in the development of drugs containing fluorine.There are several approaches to synthesizing trifluoromethyl, but the most cost-effective method involves substituting a hydrogen atom from fluoroform, a simple precursor, with another element or functional group. However, gaseous fluoroform is volatile, which makes it difficult to mix with liquids and exhibits low reactivity. Moreover, it decomposes instantly, requiring the addition of a substance that can react with it. Unfortunately, this process can result in unintended chemical reactions that lead to a low yield of trifluoromethyl.To address the challenge of synthesizing trifluoromethyl from fluoroform, the research team developed a novel gas-liquid reactor with a zigzag-shaped channel and highly permeable non-porous membranes sandwiched between upper and lower channels. This configuration allowed for the swirling and mixing of superbase, a liquid utilized for dehydrogenation, and gaseous fluoroform within the reactor.By breaking fluoroform bubbles into smaller pieces to increase the contact area between gas and liquid, the team was able to effectively produce trifluoromethyl anion (CF3-). Unlike traditional approaches, they produced a fluoride intermediate effectively without requiring stabilizers or additives.The research team synthesized a fluorine-based compound by immediately adding a compound that will react with the fluoride anion intermediate. The entire process, which involved the generation of a fluorine anion intermediate from fluoroform took place within a second. The team maximized the formation of a trifluoromethyl anion, which is known to be short-lived, and rapidly facilitated the subsequent reaction before the intermediate decomposed.This method allowed for improved yield of fluoride-based compounds and introduced a robust technique for the synthesis of fluorine-based drugs.The research findings have significant implications for industrial applications in the economically efficient synthesis of fluoride compounds, making them more practical as well contributing significantly to studies on several unstable intermediates.

  "answer_squad": " Collagen",
  "text": "Collagen is the protein that holds our body together. It is produced inside cells, from where it must be transported to its site of action in connective tissue. The protein domain that is responsible for the recognition of collagen has previously been mistaken for a subform of another.          Dr. Oliver Arnolds and Professor Raphael Stoll from the Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, have characterized and named this domain for the first time. They reported on the so-called MOTH domain of the TANGO1 protein family in the journal Nature Communications on April 20, 2023.How collagen reaches its site of actionAlmost all organisms that have more than one cell require collagen to hold their bodies together. In some mammals, it accounts for up to 30% of body weight. Collagen is a huge protein that is produced in the so-called endoplasmic reticulum, an organelle inside cells. It then has to be exported from the organelle and from the cell, because it is needed in the space between the cells in the connective tissue.A family of proteins known as TANGO1 is responsible for identifying and transporting the collagen. Made up of more than 1,000 amino acids, these proteins are very large indeed. TANGO1 proteins sometimes spread across various cell organelles and the cytoplasm. When the TANGO1 protein detects a maturating collagen, it supports the formation of a tunnel-like lipid connection that transports the collagen from its place of manufacture to its site of action.A distinct structureIn order to perform these mechanisms, TANGO1 has a specific domain, i.e., a functional area with a defined 3D structure. \"Up to now, we have assumed that this domain is similar to the so-called SH3 structure and regarded it as a substructure,\" says Raphael Stoll.In the current study, however, he and Oliver Arnolds demonstrated by means of NMR spectroscopy that there are structural differences between the collagen-recognition domain of TANGO1 and the canonical SH3 domain. These differences are so significant in terms of biochemistry that they warrant referring to this TANGO1 domain as a separate structure. Hence, they named this collagen-recognizing domain MOTH. \"The name is an acronym for the total of four proteins that adopt exactly this structure: MIA, Otoraplin, TALI/TANGO1 homology,\" explains Raphael Stoll.The discovery of the MOTH domain provides insights into evolution, because both vertebrates and invertebrates such as insects need collagen. \"The MOTH domain is very old in evolutionary terms, approximately several hundred million years,\" points out Raphael Stoll.However, as invertebrates separated from vertebrates, the domain changed during evolution. \"We assume that this process has coincided with the evolution of several different collagens. While insects have only one collagen, humans are found to have 28 different variations of it. These findings help improve our understanding of the collagen export process and could prove useful in future drug developments for fibrosis,\" concludes Stoll.

  "answer_squad": " Acetic acid",
  "text": "Chemical engineers at Monash University have developed an industrial process to produce acetic acid that uses the excess carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and has a potential to create negative carbon emissions.          Acetic acid is an important chemical used in several industrial processes and is an ingredient in household vinegar, vinyl paints and some glues. Worldwide industrial demand for acetic acid is estimated to be 6.5 million tons per year.This world-first research, published in Nature Communications, shows that acetic acid can be made from captured CO2 using an economical solid catalyst to replace the liquid rhodium or iridium based catalysts currently used.Liquid catalysts require additional separation and purification processes. Using a solid catalyst made from a production method that doesn't require further processing also reduces emissions.Lead researcher Associate Professor Akshat Tanksale said the research could be a widely adopted practice for industry. \"CO2 is over abundant in the atmosphere, and the main cause of global warming and climate change. Even if we stopped all the industrial emissions today, we would continue to see negative impacts of global warming for at least a thousand years as nature slowly balances the excess CO2,\" Prof. Tanksale said.\"There is an urgent need to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere and convert it into products that do not release the captured CO2 back into the atmosphere. Our team is focused on creating a novel industrially relevant method, which can be applied at the large scale required to encourage negative emissions.\"The research team first created a class of material called the metal organic framework (MOF) which is a highly crystalline substance made of repeating units of iron atoms connected with organic bridges.They then heated the MOF in a controlled environment to break those bridges, allowing iron atoms to come together and form particles of a few nanometers in size.These iron nanoparticles are embedded in a porous carbon layer, making them highly active while remaining stable in the harsh reaction conditions. This is the first time an iron based catalyst has been reported for making acetic acid.From an industrial point of view, the new process will be more efficient and cost effective. From an environmental perspective, the research offers an opportunity to significantly improve current manufacturing processes that pollute the environment.This means a solution to slow down or potentially reverse climate change while providing economic benefits to the industry from the sales of acetic acid products.The researchers are currently in the process of developing the process for commercialization in collaboration with their industry partners as part of the Australian Research Council (ARC) Research Hub for Carbon Utilization and Recycling.

  "answer_squad": " UXD",
  "text": "The nucleobase molecules carrying the genetic codes are the most important ingredients for life, but they are also very vulnerable. When the ultraviolet component in the sunlight irradiates these molecules, the electrons in the molecules will be excited, and the excited nucleobase molecules may result in irreversible changes or even damages to the DNA and RNA chains, leading to the \"sunburn\" of organisms at molecular level.          It is widely believed that there is a \"sunscreen\" mechanism in these nucleobase molecules which can lead to rapid decay into the ground state. The ultrafast decay mechanism for most types of nucleobases has been confirmed. However, the research team of Professor Todd Martinez at Stanford University proposed that there may be a shallow potential barrier for the excited electronic state of uracil (U) nucleobase, which hinders the decay of excited molecules.This can be understood as a trick reserved by nature to promote biological variation and evolution.This novel point of view has caused wide controversy and discussion. There are many different kinds of theoretical models about whether there is indeed a hindrance to the decay of excited state uracil. In this article, using ultrashort electron pulses and X-ray free electron lasers, the research led by Professor Zheng Li and Professor Haitan Xu provides a detailed theoretical analysis of an experimental scheme that incorporates multiple signals of ultrafast electron and X-ray diffraction and X-ray spectroscopy, and opens a way to resolve this interesting controversy.There are currently three hypotheses about the decay time scale of photoexcited uracil nucleobase. In 2007, the group of Todd Martinez proposed that the decay time of photoexcited uracil may be much longer than other nucleobases, reaching more than 1 picosecond, because the shallow potential barrier for the uracil excited state hinders the decay process.In 2009, the research group of Zhenggang Lan from the Max Planck Institute proposed that the decay of the uracil base would not pass through the potential barrier. This theoretical model predicts short decay time of photoexcited uracil, which is about 70 femtoseconds.In 2011, the research group of Pavel Hobza from the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences proposed the intermediate trajectory hypothesis, in which the uracil may have another way of structural relaxation, and the decay time through this path takes about 0.7 ps. Because the predicted potential barrier in the uracil excited state is very shallow, and due to the precision limit of quantum chemical calculations, different theoretical hypotheses give contradictory predictions of electronic decay pathways.      The authors propose an approach which can uniquely identify the electronic decay mechanism of the photoexcited uracil with ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy (XPS), ultrafast X-ray diffraction (UXD), and ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) methods. Incorporating the signatures of multiple probing methods, the authors demonstrate an approach that can identify the geometric and electronic relaxation characteristic time scales of the photoexcited uracil molecule among several candidate models.The XPS signal provides the toolkit to map out the valence electron density variation in the chosen atomic sites of molecules. X-ray can ionize core electrons of molecules, and the shift of photoelectron energy in XPS in the molecule reflects the strength of electron screening effect of nuclear charge, which maps out the local density of valence electrons at the specific atom. Ultrafast diffraction imaging has been widely used to resolve the molecular structural dynamics.UED is capable of characterizing the correlation between electrons and can be used to monitor the electronic population transfer dynamics. Compared to UED, UXD can resolve the transient geometric structure with higher temporal precision, which is free of pulse length limitation of UED because of space charge effect of electron bunch compression.Combining the above signals of multiple experimental results, the characteristic time scales of geometric and electronic relaxation can be obtained, and the decay pathway of photoexcited uracil molecule can be identified.The authors have performed molecular dynamics simulations following the long trajectory hypothesis, and calculated the ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy and coherent diffraction imaging signals. In the long trajectory hypothesis, the uracil molecule first relaxes into minimum energy geometry in the S2 state and then decays to S1 state.The structural and electronic transition dynamics during the decay of uracil nucleobases can be reflected by XPS signal. Choosing the carbon K-edge for the X-ray probe, the variation of XPS signal in corresponding energy range is fitted, and two relaxation time scales (about 3.5 ps and 0.2 ps) are obtained.These two characteristic time scales are related to the molecular structural evolution and electronic state transition dynamics, but the exact determination of the time scales requires combining analysis of coherent diffraction imaging, because the information of structural and electronic evolutions are usually mixed in the XPS signal.UED is capable of characterizing the mean distance between electrons and can be used to detect the electronic population transfer dynamics. The calculated time-resolved electron diffraction signal based on molecular dynamics trajectories reflects 4.2 ps time scale of electronic state decay obtained by exponential fitting, which confirms that the 3.5 ps characteristic time scale of XPS is related to electronic transition dynamics.The pair distribution function reflecting the average distance between atoms is obtained by Fourier transformation of UXD signal, which shows that one of the C-C bond lengths in uracil molecule is elongated in about 0.2 ps after photoexcitation followed by relaxation into minimum energy geometry in the excited state.The time-frequency analysis of UXD signal by continuous wavelet transform reveals the frequencies of the dominant modes, and the 0.2 ps time scale of molecular structure evolution, which is consistent with the characteristic frequencies and 0.2 ps time scale of structural evolution obtained from XPS signal.It is shown that the characteristic time scales of geometric relaxation and electronic decay of uracil in the long trajectory model can be faithfully retrieved by incorporating time-resolved XPS, UED and UXD analyses.Incorporating the signatures of multiple probing methods, the authors demonstrate an approach to identify the decay pathway of photoexcited nucleobases among several candidate models. This study demonstrates the synergy of spectroscopic and coherent diffraction imaging with ultrafast time resolution, which can also serve as a general methodological toolkit for investigating electronic and structural dynamics in ultrafast photochemistry.The research is published in the journal Ultrafast Science.

  "text": "We know a lot about mosquito preferences up close, but how do mosquitoes find us from up to a hundred meters away? Using an ice-rink-sized outdoor testing arena in Zambia, researchers found that human body odor is critical for mosquito host-seeking behavior over long distances. The team also identified specific airborne body-odor components that might explain why some people are more attractive to mosquitoes than others. The work appears May 19 in the journal Current Biology.          Most studies of mosquito preference have been performed in confined laboratory settings that probably don't represent a mosquito's experience in the wild. To test how the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae locates and chooses human hosts over a large and more realistic spatial scale, researchers from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Malaria Research Institute and Macha Research Trust teamed up to build a 1,000 m3 testing arena in Choma District, Zambia.\"This is the largest system to assess olfactory preference for any mosquito in the world,\" says neuroscientist Diego Giraldo, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, one of the study's first authors. \"And it's a very busy sensory environment for the mosquitoes.\"The testing arena contained a ring of evenly spaced landing pads that were heated to human skin temperature (35\u00baC). Each night, the researchers released 200 hungry mosquitoes into the testing arena and monitored their activity using infrared motion cameras. Specifically, they took note of how often mosquitoes landed on each of the landing pads (which is a good sign that they're ready to bite).A video of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes landing on a heated pad that is baited with human body odor and illuminated by infrared LEDs. Credit: Diego GiraldoFirst, the team compared the relative importance of heat, CO2, and human body odor for attracting mosquitoes. They found that mosquitoes were not attracted to the heated landing pads unless they were also baited with CO2, but human body odor was a more attractive bait than CO2 alone.Next, the team tested the mosquitoes' choosiness. To do this, they had six people sleep in single-person tents surrounding the arena over six consecutive nights, and they used repurposed air conditioner ducting to pipe air from each tent\u2014containing the aromas of its sleeping occupant\u2014onto the heated landing pads. As well as recording the mosquitoes' preferences, the researchers collected nightly air samples from the tents to characterize and compare the airborne components of body odor.\"These mosquitoes typically hunt humans in the hours before and after midnight,\" says senior author and vector biologist Conor McMeniman, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute. \"They follow scent trails and convective currents emanating from humans, and typically they'll enter homes and bite between around 10 PM and 2 AM. We wanted to assess mosquito olfactory preferences during the peak period of activity when they're out and about and active and also assess the odor from sleeping humans during that same time window.\"      They found that, night after night, some people were more attractive to mosquitoes than others, and one of the volunteers, who had a strikingly different odor composition from the others, consistently attracted very few mosquitoes.The team identified 40 chemicals that were emitted by all of the humans, though at different rates. \"It's probably a ratio-specific blend that they're following,\" says analytical chemist Stephanie Rankin-Turner , a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the study's other first author. \"We don't really know yet exactly what aspect of skin secretions, microbial metabolites, or breath emissions are really driving this, but we're hoping we'll be able to figure that out in the coming years.\"Though each person's odor profile varied from night to night, the researchers found some stable patterns. People who were more attractive to mosquitoes consistently emitted more carboxylic acids, which are probably produced by skin microbes. In contrast, the person who was least attractive to mosquitoes emitted less carboxylic acids but approximately triple the amount of eucalyptol, a compound found in many plants; the researchers hypothesize that elevated levels of eucalyptol may be related to the person's diet.The researchers were surprised by how effectively the mosquitoes could locate and choose between potential human meals within the huge arena. \"When you see something moved from a tiny laboratory space where the odors are right there, and the mosquitoes are still finding them in this big open space out in a field in Zambia, it really drives home just how powerful these mosquitoes are as host seekers,\" says Rankin-Turner.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the iodide that can convert almost all absorbed energy into detectable light?",
  "answer_squad": " Cs3Cu2I5",
  "text": "Advanced electronic devices require high-quality materials such as metal halide phosphors that can effectively convert light into measurable signals. Toxic element-free copper-based iodides such as cesium copper iodide (Cs3Cu2I5: CCI) are particularly promising in this regard.          CCI is an efficient blue light-emitting material that can convert almost all the absorbed energy into detectable light, making them ideal for use in deep-UV photodetectors and \u03b3-ray scintillators for detecting ionizing radiation, such as gamma or X-rays. However, the thin films of CCI do not meet the required quality standards, hindering their performance improvement for advanced stacking applications.Now, a study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society has addressed this issue by proposing an innovative method for producing high-quality thin films of Cs3Cu2I5. The study was led by researchers from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), including Professor Hideo Hosono as the corresponding author and Specially Appointed Assistant Professor Masatake Tsuji as the first author.In an earlier experimental finding, the team had discovered that cesium iodide (CsI) and copper iodide (CuI) powders can react even at room temperature to form Cs3Cu2I5. Building on this insight, they deposited thin films of CuI and CsI onto a silica substrate by evaporating them in a vacuum chamber. The two films were then allowed to react at room temperature to form transparent and highly smooth films with a high optical transmittance (T) of 92%.Interestingly, the researchers found that the order in which the layers were deposited affected the formed crystalline phases. They noticed that the deposition of CsI layer over CuI resulted in the formation of a blue light-emitting thin film of Cs3Cu2I5, which is the equilibrium phase under this thickness ratio condition.In contrast, depositing CuI over CsI resulted in a yellow light-emitting thin film of CsCu2I3. The formation of these different phases was attributed to an interdiffusion of the Cs and Cu atoms between the two layers. Based on these observations, the researchers found that the formation of each phase could be controlled by simply adjusting the thickness of each film to reach a specific ratio of CsI to CuI.The researchers thus argued that the interdiffusion process leads to the formation of distinct local structures containing point defects that decay through nonradiative channels upon photoexcitation, resulting in highly efficient emissions.\"We propose that this formation originates from the rapid diffusion of Cu+ and I\u2212 ions into CsI crystals along with the formation of I\u2212 at the Cs+ site and interstitial Cu+ in the CsI lattice,\" explains Prof. Hosono. The photoluminescent properties of Cs3Cu2I5 originate from the unique local structure around the luminescent center, the asymmetric [Cu2I5]3\u2212polyhedron iodocuprate anion, consisting of the edge-shared CuI3 triangle and the CuI4 tetrahedron dimer that is isolated by Cs+ ions.Using this approach, the researchers were able to fabricate patterned thin films by selectively depositing a CsI layer through a shadow mask. This allowed them to control the deposition of CsI and pattern only the desired area of the substrate.By carefully adjusting for the thickness of the CuI and CsI layers, they were able to successfully fabricate a film with a central blue light-emitting Cs3Cu2I5 region bordered by a yellow light-emitting CsCu2I3 region. In addition, they demonstrated that the same thin films can be obtained by using solution-processed CuI and patterned CsI thin films for anticipation of future applications.\"Our study explains the mechanism underlying the formation of the rare local structures in Cs3Cu2I5 and its association with photoluminescence in these materials. These results can ultimately pave the way for the development of high-quality thin film devices with ideal optical properties for advanced stacking applications,\" concludes Prof. Hosono.

  "text": "The never-ending demand for carbon-rich fuels to drive the economy keeps adding more and more carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. While efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions, that alone cannot counter the adverse effects of the gas already present in the atmosphere.          So, scientists have come up with innovative ways to use existing atmospheric CO2 by transforming it into useful chemicals such as formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol. A popular method for carrying out such conversions is to use visible light for driving the photoreduction of CO2 via photocatalysts.In a recent breakthrough published in Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, a team of researchers led by Prof. Kazuhiko Maeda of Tokyo Institute of Technology developed a tin-based metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) that can enable selective photoreduction of CO2. They reported a novel tin (Sn)-based MOF called KGF-10, with the formula [SnII2(H3ttc)2.MeOH]n (H3ttc: trithiocyanuric acid and MeOH: methanol).It successfully reduced CO2 into HCOOH in the presence of visible light. \"Most high-performance CO2 reduction photocatalysts driven by visible light rely on rare, precious metals as principal components. Furthermore, integrating the functions of light absorption and catalysis into a single molecular unit made up of abundant metals has remained a long-standing challenge. Hence, Sn was the ideal candidate as it can overcome both challenges,\" explains Prof. Maeda.MOFs, which bring the best of both metals and organic materials, are being explored as the more sustainable alternative to conventional rare-earth metal-based photocatalysts. Sn, known for its ability to act as both a catalyst and absorber during a photocatalytic reaction, could be a promising candidate for MOF-based photocatalysts. While MOFs composed of zirconium, iron, and lead have been widely explored, not much is known about Sn-based MOFs.For synthesizing the Sn-based MOF KGF-10, the researchers used H3ttc, MeOH, and tin chloride as the starting materials and chose 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole as the electron donor and the hydrogen source. The prepared KGF-10 was then subjected to several analysis techniques. They revealed that the material showed moderate CO2 adsorption ability, had a bandgap of 2.5 eV, and absorbed visible light wavelengths.Once aware of the physical and chemical properties of the new material, scientists used it for catalyzing the reduction of CO2 in the presence of visible light. They found that KGF-10 successfully reduced CO2 into formate (HCOO-) with 99% selectivity without needing any additional photosensitizer or catalyst. It also exhibited a record-high apparent quantum yield\u2014 the ratio of the number of electrons involved in the reaction to the total number of incident photons\u2014of 9.8% at 400 nm. Furthermore, structural analysis carried out during the reactions revealed that KGF-10 underwent structural changes while facilitating photocatalytic reduction.This study presented for the first time a tin-based high-performance, precious-metal free, and single-component photocatalyst for visible-light-driven reduction of CO2 to formate. The excellent properties of KGF-10 demonstrated by the team could open new avenues for its application as a photocatalyst in reactions such as solar energy-driven CO2 reduction.\"The results of our study are a testimony to the fact that MOFs can be a platform for creating outstanding photocatalytic functions, usually unattainable with molecular metal complexes, using non-toxic, inexpensive, and Earth-abundant metals,\" concludes Prof. Maeda.

  "text": "Chemistry researchers at Flinders University have 'struck gold' by discovering a new way to make 'green' polymers from low-cost building blocks with just a small amount of electricity.          The reaction is fast and occurs at room temperature. No hazardous chemical initiators are required\u2014just electricity, with many potential uses including in gold mining and recycling e-waste, an interdisciplinary team reveal in an article just published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.While hundreds of millions of tons of plastic is produced every year, with up to half used for single purposes, the Flinders University research group is working on more sustainable options. The power used in production is a contributor to pollution and global warming.\"The use of electricity to produce new materials is an emerging field of research that opens many doors to new chemicals and polymers that can be produced in a more sustainable way,\" says co-author Dr. Thomas Nicholls, an expert in using electrochemistry to make valuable molecules.The process begins by adding an electron to the basic building block or monomer. After 'electrocuting' the monomer, it reacts with another building block in a chain reaction which leads to the formation of a polymer.First-author and Ph.D. candidate Jasmine Pople says, \"Our method to electrochemically produce polymers provides new materials that are highly functional and environmentally friendly.\"\"The use of electricity to make valuable molecules is expanding rapidly due to its versatility. Additionally, it may generate less waste than traditional chemical syntheses and it can be powered with renewable energy.\"The key polymer made by the team has sulfur-sulfur bonds in its backbone. These sulfur groups can do useful things like bind precious metals such as gold. The team demonstrated that the key polymer could remove 97% of gold from solutions of relevance to mining and e-waste recycling.The sulfur-sulfur bonds can also be broken and reformed. This interesting property enabled the team to discover conditions to convert the polymer back to its original building block. This is an important advance in recycling.Typically, when common plastics are recycled, they are simply heated and reshaped into a new product. This process can cause degradation and down-cycling (conversion to a less valuable material), leading to eventual disposal in landfill.In contrast, the polymers made in the latest research from Flinders University scientists can be chemically converted back into its constituent building blocks in high yield\u2014meaning that building block can be used again to make new polymers.The team also carried out quantum mechanical calculations to understand the details of how the reaction works. The findings were surprising and fortuitous.\"The polymerization has a clever self-correcting mechanism: whenever the wrong reaction occurs, it reverses until the correct reaction proceeds, ensuring a uniform polymer,\" says Research Associate in computational and physical chemistry Dr. Le Nhan PhamFuture applications of this class of materials include environmental remediation, gold mining, and use of the polymer as an anti-microbial agent.

The study, published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, was led by Insilico's Taiwan and UAE centers which focus on pioneering and constructing breakthrough methods and engines with rapidly developing technologies\u2014including generative AI and quantum computing\u2014to accelerate drug discovery and development.The research was supported by University of Toronto Acceleration Consortium director Al\u00e1n Aspuru-Guzik, Ph.D., and scientists from the Hon Hai (Foxconn) Research Institute.\"This international collaboration was a very fun project,\" said Al\u00e1n Aspuru-Guzik, director of the Acceleration Consortium and professor of computer science and chemistry at the University of Toronto. \"It sets the stage for further developments in AI as it meets drug discovery. This is a global collaboration where Foxconn, Insilico, Zapata Computing, and University of Toronto are working together.\"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most successful generative models in drug discovery and design and have shown remarkable results for generating data that mimics a data distribution in different tasks. The classic GAN model consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator takes random noises as input and tries to imitate the data distribution, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between the fake and real samples. A GAN is trained until the discriminator cannot distinguish the generated data from the real data.In this paper, researchers explored the quantum advantage in small molecule drug discovery by substituting each part of MolGAN, an implicit GAN for small molecular graphs, with a variational quantum circuit (VQC), step by step, including as the noise generator, generator with the patch method, and quantum discriminator, comparing its performance with the classical counterpart.The study not only demonstrated that the trained quantum GANs can generate training-set-like molecules by using the VQC as the noise generator, but that the quantum generator outperforms the classical GAN in the drug properties of generated compounds and the goal-directed benchmark.In addition, the study showed that the quantum discriminator of GAN with only tens of learnable parameters can generate valid molecules and outperforms the classical counterpart with tens of thousands parameters in terms of generated molecule properties and KL-divergence score.\"Quantum computing is recognized as the next technology breakthrough which will make a great impact, and the pharmaceutical industry is believed to be among the first wave of industries benefiting from the advancement,\" said Jimmy Yen-Chu Lin, Ph.D., GM of Insilico Medicine Taiwan and corresponding author of the paper. \"This paper demonstrates Insilico's first footprint in quantum computing with AI in molecular generation, underscoring our vision in the field.\"Building on these findings, Insilico scientists plan to integrate the hybrid quantum GAN model into Chemistry42, the Company's proprietary small molecule generation engine, to further accelerate and improve its AI-driven drug discovery and development process.Insilico was one of the first to use GANs in de novo molecular design, and published the first paper in this field in 2016.

  "text": "To be able to exploit the advantages of elements and their molecular compounds in a targeted manner, chemists have to develop a fundamental understanding of their properties. In the case of the element bismuth, a team from the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung has now taken an important step.          Chemists at the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung strive for the rational design of chemical processes that lead to more efficient and sustainable chemistry for academia as well as industry. A fundamental understanding of the properties of elements such as bismuth and their molecular compounds is necessary in order to be able to take advantage of their potential for catalysis.A team led by Josep Cornell\u00e0 and Frank Neese, group leader and director at the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung, has now found that there are still some \"white spots\" in the chemical landscape that need to be tapped. The researchers have now published their work on an intriguing property of new bismuth complexes in the journal Science.Why bismuth? Research group leader Josep Cornell\u00e0's team has been interested in this particular metal for quite a while. \"Bismuth can offer some advantages\u2014compared to other metals. For example, it is more readily available and less toxic than other elements. In addition, special properties of bismuth that other 'classical' catalysis candidates do not have could play a role in future reaction designs,\" Cornell\u00e0 explains.What is it that makes the M\u00fclheim Bismuth molecule so special? Atoms consist of the atomic nucleus as well as an atomic shell formed by electrons. When molecules are synthesized from atoms or fragments, usually pairs of electrons from different atoms come together to for chemical bonds. However, chemists are often interested in situation that deviate from this situation, which is the case when the molecules have unpaired electrons. Such systems tend to be highly reactive and will readily interact with other molecules.\"Normally, molecules with unpaired electrons are always magnetic,\" explains Frank Neese. But now the researchers of the Kohlenforschung have developed a molecule containing bismuth that has unpaired electrons and yet, strangely enough, shows no magnetism at all. The solution to this riddle has to do with, among other things, the special position of bismuth in the periodic table of the elements.Bismuth is the heaviest of the stable elements\u2014all subsequent elements are radioactive. Due to the particularly heavy atomic nucleus, the electrons show a special behavior, which can only be understood with the help of Einstein's theory of relativity. These properties lead to the initially perplexing experimental finding.\"Our molecule is not really 'non-magnetic',\" the researchers explain, \"but there is no magnetic field on Earth strong enough to detect magnetism in our system.\" The fact that the researchers were able to calculate the fascinating properties of this molecule from first principles of physics is due to the quantum chemistry program package ORCA, developed in M\u00fclheim and widely used throughout all chemical disciplines by tens of thousands of chemists worldwide.With their work, the scientists from M\u00fclheim have added an important point to the \"chemical profile\" of bismuth. This may be of importance in the future when designing new types of catalysts.

  "text": "Pharmaceutical drugs can save lives, but taking these medications as prescribed\u2014especially among those with chronic conditions\u2014can be challenging, for a variety of different reasons. Improving medication adherence could reduce unfavorable health outcomes, hospitalizations, and preventable deaths, while simultaneously reducing health care costs by up to $300B annually in the United States alone.          One potential way to increase adherence is to reduce how often a person needs to take their medication. This can be achieved through a controlled-release system, where a single injection contains a drug that is continually released in the body over an extended period of time. Unfortunately, many controlled-release systems deliver a substantial portion of their cargo right after injection, which can result in inconsistent drug dosing\u2014more drug is released initially (potentially resulting in toxicity) and less drug is released over time (potentially at too small a dose to be effective). A system that could release discrete doses at specific time points could revolutionize the way drugs are delivered, from multi-dose vaccinations to daily medications.Responding to this challenge, researchers from Rice University have developed PULSED (for Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs). Their method, recently reported in Advanced Materials, creates drug-filled microparticles that can be engineered to degrade and release their therapeutic cargo days or weeks after injection. By combining multiple microparticles with different degradation times into a single injection, the researchers could develop a drug formulation that delivers many doses over time.\"As a field, we are continually aiming to develop effective and efficient drug delivery systems that maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize side effects, which can ultimately improve medication adherence,\" said Luisa Russell, Ph.D., a program director in the Division of Discovery Science & Technology at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB). \"With several doses combined into a single treatment, the controlled-release system described here could transform the therapeutic landscape, potentially negating the need for frequent drug administration, both at home and at the clinic.\"The PULSED microparticles are composed of PLGA, or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), a commonly used polymer in a number of FDA-approved devices. PLGA is made up of repeating units of lactic acid and glycolic acid, two molecules that occur naturally in our bodies. By extending the overall length of the polymer, modifying the ratio of lactic acid to glycolic acid, and \"capping\" the end of the polymer with different molecules, researchers can dictate how long it takes PLGA to disintegrate (and thereby release its therapeutic payload).      \"In our case, we can combine populations of microparticles with different PLGA compositions that each release their entire contents at one distinct time point,\" explained senior study author Kevin McHugh, Ph.D., an assistant professor at Rice University. \"This allows us to achieve multiple release events at specific, predetermined times.\"Here's how the drug-loaded microparticles are made: Heated, semiliquid PLGA is pressed into a mold and then cooled, solidifying in the shape of hollow cylinders with an opening at the top. The core of each microparticle is filled with therapeutic cargo, and then the top of the microparticles are heated, causing the PLGA to melt and flow over the opening to seal the drug inside. The initial particles that the researchers developed were 400 micrometers in diameter (for reference, the thickness of a dime is about 1350 micrometers).As a first step, the researchers filled four different PLGA microparticle shells with dextran (a type of sugar) that was tagged with a fluorescent molecule, allowing them to easily visualize and measure cargo release. They incubated the microparticles in a body-temperature buffer to mimic real-life conditions and found that the microparticles released their contents at staggered intervals, ranging from roughly eight to 31 days, depending on the PLGA formulation. Importantly, the researchers found that each microparticle formulation released its cargo rapidly, emptying 75% of the dextran over a period of approximately one to three days. They had similar results when they repeated the experiments in mice.\"While we extended the microparticle degradation time to roughly five weeks in this study, we have only begun to tinker with PLGA compositions to further extend their degradation times and subsequent drug release,\" said McHugh. \"Based on our previous work with other systems, we are confident that by changing PLGA length and component ratios, we could extend release to six months and likely much longer.\"After the researchers optimized their microparticle fabrication process, they needed to ensure that a pharmaceutical drug was still viable once encased inside. Many drugs\u2014especially biologic agents, which are developed using living components\u2014are sensitive to heat, which the researchers use to seal their microparticles.What's more, the researchers wanted to be certain that long-term storage inside the human body\u2014conditions that heat and acidify the microparticles\u2014wouldn't adversely affect the drug. They encapsulated bevacizumab (an FDA-approved antibody that is used to treat several types of cancer) into their microparticles along with different kinds of excipients (inactive drug stabilizers) and evaluated the drug's activity. With the right combination of excipients, the microparticles released bioactive and viable bevacizumab, even after weeks under simulated body conditions.Finally, the researchers wanted to push the envelope and further miniaturize their microparticles. While the original particles could easily flow through an 18-gauge needle, which is routinely used for things like blood collection, smaller needles are preferred for pediatric vaccinations and insulin administration, which typically range from 22 to 31 gauge. Using a smaller mold and the same fabrication method, the researchers were able to shrink the microparticles down to a diameter of 100 micrometers. The loading capacity of these tiny microparticles is 50-fold lower than the original microparticles, but they could potentially be used with even the smallest of commonly used needles, said McHugh. Future work will include evaluating the disintegration time and cargo release of these miniaturized particles.\"Routes of drug administration are often underappreciated in the field of pharmaceutical medicine,\" McHugh said. \"Our study, while still early in development, could reshape how routine vaccinations and recurring medications are delivered, ultimately improving medication adherence and human health.\" More information:Tyler P.

  "answer_squad": " OXZEO",
  "text": "Researchers have reported a strategy to disentangle the activity-selectivity tradeoff for direct conversion of syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, into desirable ethylene, propylene, and butylene. These hydrocarbons are known as light olefins and are the most-used building blocks for plastics.          \"Activity and selectivity are two primary indexes of a successful catalyst for chemical reactions. A higher activity means higher efficiency in converting feedstock to products, thereby reducing energy consumption,\" said Jiao Feng, an associate professor at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Dalian, China. \"Selectivity reflects the percentage of the desired products; for example, ethylene, propylene and butylene in this case, which determines the economy of the technology.\"For almost a century, a process called the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) was used for direct syngas conversion with iron or cobalt-based catalysts for synthesis of chemicals. However, selectivity for light olefins remained a challenge. An alternative process, named OXZEO and developed six years ago by the same research team using metal oxide-zeolite catalyst, improved light-olefin selectivity far beyond the theoretical limit of FTS. Despite the significant progress over the years, the activity is still limited by the activity-selectivity tradeoff.For example, when FTS is used to convert syngas to light olefins, the yield amounts to around 26%. Using traditional silicon containing zeotypes within the OXZEO catalyst concept, the light-olefins yield has so far maxed out at 27%. These limits originate from activity-selectivity tradeoff, a long-standing challenge in catalysis. This can be traced to the catalytic sites for both the target and side reactions, which are usually entangled on technical catalysts.Now, in a paper published in the journal Science on May, 18, 2023, a team led by Dr. Jiao, Prof. Pan and Prof. Bao has shown that incorporating germanium-substituted aluminophosphates within the OXZEO catalyst concept can disentangle the desired target reaction from the undesired secondary reactions. It enhances the conversion of the intermediates to produce olefins by creating more active sites and in turn generation of intermediates but without degrading the selectivity of light olefins. With this new strategy, researchers simultaneously achieved high CO conversion and light-olefins selectivity and the yield reached an unprecedented 48% under optimized conditions.To validate the mechanism, researchers also studied silicon-substitute and magnesium-substitute aluminophosphates and tested them in similar scenarios. The active sites of these two zeotypes cannot efficiently shield the side reaction of hydrogenation and oligomerization, thereby the activity-selectivity tradeoff cannot be overcome, despite optimizing the acid site density or reaction conditions.\"Separating the active sites of the two key steps of syngas conversion via OXZEO catalysts, and increasing the active site density and modulating its properties for kinetics of intermediate transport and reactions within the zeotype confined pores provides one effective solution for syngas conversion to light olefins,\" said Pan Xiulian, professor at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Dalian, China. \"We expect that this can be applicable to analogous bifunctional catalysis in other reactions and will be of interest for further development of zeolite catalysis.\"\"If it can be incorporated with green hydrogen energy technology in the future, it will make significant contribution to the goal of carbon neutrality,\" said Bao Xinhe, professor at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Dalian and the President of the University of Science and Technology of China.

  "answer_squad": " chlorine",
  "text": "A team of chemists from Tsinghua University and Guangxi Normal University, both in China, has found an organic catalyst that can be used to make chlorine more energy efficiently. In their paper published in the journal Nature, the group describes how they searched for and found an organocatalyst with an amide functional group that could be used to enable a chlorine evolution reaction.          Thomas Turek, with Clausthal University of Technology, has published a News and Views piece in the same journal issue outlining the work done by the team in China.Chlorine (a yellowish-green gas at room temperature) is widely used to disinfect water, such as in swimming pools. But it is also used in a wide variety of other applications such as making plastics and bleaching paper. Unfortunately, the process for producing chlorine uses a lot of energy and also emits a lot of carbon dioxide\u2014it involves electrolysis of sodium chloride solutions that generate both chlorine and sodium hydroxide\u2014both of which are used in manufacturing applications.For that reason, scientists have been looking for more efficient and cleaner ways to make the material. One such approach has involved the use of organic (instead of metal) catalysts because they tend to be less expensive, less toxic and they are generally easier to obtain.After searching for possibilities, the team found an organic molecule in the amide group RCON-H that enabled the creation of chlorine by helping chloride ions in salt water combine in ways that led to the production of chlorine on a positive electrode. They also found that adding CO2 gave rise to the intermediate, carbamic acid, which enhanced efficiency of the catalyst exponentially; this was because it binds to the amide nitrogen and in so doing created a radical species.They also found that after the reaction, it was relatively easy to separate the CO2 from the chlorine because of the differences in physical properties. Testing showed that the process was able to achieve a density of 10 kA m\u207b\u00b2 and had a selectivity of 99.6% with an overpotential of just 89 mV.The team concludes by noting that future processes using the new catalyst would use far less energy than the conventional approach and they would be much cleaner\u2014many would not release any harmful by-products at all. They also suggest that their new approach could pave the way in general for a cleaner approach to producing chlorine.

  "text": "At least 2 billion people worldwide routinely drink water contaminated with disease-causing microbes.          Now Stanford University scientists have invented a low-cost, recyclable powder that kills thousands of waterborne bacteria per second when exposed to ordinary sunlight. The discovery of this ultrafast disinfectant could be a significant advance for nearly 30% of the world's population with no access to safe drinking water, according to the Stanford team. Their results are published in Nature Wateron May 18.\"Waterborne diseases are responsible for 2 million deaths annually, the majority in children under the age of 5,\" said study co-lead author Tong Wu, a former postdoctoral scholar of materials science and engineering (MSE) in the Stanford School of Engineering. \"We believe that our novel technology will facilitate revolutionary changes in water disinfection and inspire more innovations in this exciting interdisciplinary field.\"Conventional water-treatment technologies include chemicals, which can produce toxic byproducts, and ultraviolet light, which takes a relatively long time to disinfect and requires a source of electricity.The new disinfectant developed at Stanford is a harmless metallic powder that works by absorbing both UV and high-energy visible light from the sun. The powder consists of nano-sized flakes of aluminum oxide, molybdenum sulfide, copper, and iron oxide.\"We only used a tiny amount of these materials,\" said senior author Yi Cui, the Fortinet Founders Professor of MSE and of Energy Science & Engineering in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. \"The materials are low cost and fairly abundant. The key innovation is that, when immersed in water, they all function together.\"Fast, nontoxic, and recyclableAfter absorbing photons from the sun, the molybdenum sulfide/copper catalyst performs like a semiconductor/metal junction, enabling the photons to dislodge electrons. The freed electrons then react with the surrounding water, generating hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals\u2014one of the most biologically destructive forms of oxygen. The newly formed chemicals quickly kill the bacteria by seriously damaging their cell membranes.      For the study, the Stanford team used a 200 milliliter [6.8 ounce] beaker of room-temperature water contaminated with about 1 million E. coli bacteria per mL [.03 oz.].\"We stirred the powder into the contaminated water,\" said co-lead author Bofei Liu, a former MSE postdoc. \"Then we carried out the disinfection test on the Stanford campus in real sunlight, and within 60 seconds, no live bacteria were detected.\"The powdery nanoflakes can move around quickly, make physical contact with a lot of bacteria and kill them fast, he added.The chemical byproducts generated by sunlight also dissipate quickly.\"The lifetime of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxy radicals is very short,\" Cui said. \"If they don't immediately find bacteria to oxidize, the chemicals break down into water and oxygen and are discarded within seconds. So you can drink the water right away.\"The nontoxic powder is also recyclable. Iron oxide enables the nanoflakes to be removed from water with an ordinary magnet. In the study, the researchers used magnetism to collect the same powder 30 times to treat 30 different samples of contaminated water.\"For hikers and backpackers, I could envision carrying a tiny amount of powder and a small magnet,\" Cui said. \"During the day you put the powder in water, shake it up a little bit under sunlight and within a minute you have drinkable water. You use the magnet to take out the particles for later use.\"The powder might also be useful in wastewater treatment plants that currently use UV lamps to disinfect treated water, he added.\"During the day the plant can use visible sunlight, which would work much faster than UV and would probably save energy,\" Cui said. \"The nanoflakes are fairly easy to make and can be rapidly scaled up by the ton.\"The study focused on E. coli, which can cause severe gastrointestinal illness and can even be life-threatening. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has set the maximum contaminant-level goal for E. coli in drinking water at zero. The Stanford team plans to test the new powder on other waterborne pathogens, including viruses, protozoa, and parasites that also cause serious diseases and death.

  "text": "The University of Alicante Applied Biochemistry research group\u2060\u2014in collaboration with researchers from the Alicante University Hospital Dr. Balmis (HGUDB) and the Alicante Health and Biomedical Research Institute (ISABIAL)\u2060\u2014has identified the anti-cancer capacity of a pigment present in the Santa Pola salt flats. This pigment is produced by certain microorganisms, the \"halophilic archaea,\" in order to protect themselves from the sun, and its anti-tumor capacity has been tested in several types of breast cancer.          Professor in Biology and director of the group Rosa Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez explains that this important finding, which has been published in the journal Scientific Reports, began with the development of Micaela Giani's Ph.D. thesis. There, she demonstrated\u2014through in vitro tests\u2014the antioxidant activity of the pigment and its effect on enzymes (biocatalysts) that are involved in pathologies such as diabetes or metabolic syndrome such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome.After these results were made public, it was then that they wondered what would happen if they added the pigment to the cancer cells, based on the hypothesis that, being a pigment with an antioxidant activity almost 300 times higher than that of other antioxidants, it could limit the ability of these cells to grow and reproduce, as explained by the researcher.In this second phase, the research group has worked in collaboration with Dr. Gloria Peir\u00f3, pathologist at the HGUDB and lecturer in the UA Department of Biotechnology, and Yoel Genaro Montoyo-Pujol, Ph.D. in Experimental and Biosanitary Sciences and researcher also at the UA, both belonging to the breast cancer and immunology research group at ISABIAL.                Credit: Asociacion RUVID             Thanks to this collaboration, the effect of this pigment could be tested in vitro in cell lines representing different intrinsic phenotypes of breast cancer and a line of healthy breast tissue. According to Mart\u00ednez, they have reached the conclusion that, in certain doses, the pigment does not cause any harmful effect on healthy cells, but it does limit the growth capacity of neoplastic cells. She also stressed that this finding opens a door to biomedicine, to the design of new strategies to fight cancer based on the use of natural compounds, which are not harmful to the body.Halophilic archaea are extremophilic microorganisms that require a hypersaline environment to thrive, so they are mainly found in coastal salt marshes, inland salt marshes or hypersaline lakes. These microorganisms synthesize rare C50 carotenoid pigments called bacteriorruberin (BR) and its derivatives monoanhydrobacterioruberin (MABR) and bisanhydrobacterioruberin (BABR).Based on this discovery, as the researcher pointed out, there are several phases to be developed, starting with extending the study with different cell lines of other types of tumors, to continue with tests on tissue samples from biopsies or surgical specimens, in order to design possible treatment protocols using this pigment, and then move on to animal studies before reaching clinical use in patients.

  "text": "Food allergies pose a significant health risk, resulting in numerous hospitalizations every year, as even trace amounts of allergens can trigger severe reactions. Cross-contamination of food products can happen easily in the production process, so it's important to have reliable methods of testing for allergens.          A new study conducted at the University of Illinois explores the application of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to detect three types of allergens in quinoa flour. The researchers say the method is fast, easy, non-invasive, inexpensive, and highly accurate.\"Detecting adulterated allergenic components in food could benefit millions of people around the world who suffer from food allergies,\" said Qianyi (Lisa) Wu, an undergraduate student in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U of l, and lead author on the paper. The project was supported by a grant from the Office of Undergraduate Research at U of I.\"We use an NIR device to measure spectral information through the reflectance of light in the samples. We tested models with different wavelengths to determine the best NIR system for allergen detection,\" she added.The researchers used NIR spectroscopy to identify three common allergens\u2014peanut, sesame, and wheat\u2014in quinoa flour, a gluten-free grain that is often used as a wheat substitute. Adulterated or contaminated quinoa could be dangerous for people with allergies, so it is crucial to find any presence of allergens.Traditional laboratory methods for allergen detection typically involve complex DNA analyses that require costly equipment and specialized personnel. These methods are time-consuming, involve the use of chemicals, and often result in destruction of the sample, so industry scientists are seeking better approaches to detect allergens.\"NIR spectroscopy offers numerous advantages. It is non-destructive, non-invasive, and doesn't use chemicals. It provides results in real time, and with a short training period, anyone can perform the analysis,\" said Mohammed Kamruzzaman, assistant professor in ABE and Wu's faculty advisor. Kamruzzaman is corresponding author on the paper.      NIR spectroscopy uses near-infrared light to measure the absorbance of different wavelengths, Kamruzzaman explained.\"Each material has a unique 'fingerprint' of light absorbance. When allergens are present in the quinoa flour, the NIR instrument can detect them. Then we use machine learning to analyze the gathered information, allowing us to identify the allergens and quantify their concentration,\" he said.NIR spectroscopy is an indirect method of analysis, so it is not 100% accurate but comes very close. Even if it doesn't capture the exact amount of contaminants present in the food, it will identify whether the allergen is there or not, and that is what the consumer needs to know, Kamruzzaman stated.Other techniques usually focus on detecting a single allergen, but this method can detect multiple allergens simultaneously. It can easily be modified to detect additional allergens and to test other products than quinoa.The researchers said it will not be difficult to develop low-cost miniature sensors based on their methodology. These sensors can be used in various settings, including industry facilities, restaurants, and even homes. Eventually it may even be possible to have a mobile phone app that can detect food allergens on the spot.Wu said the opportunity to conduct research as an undergraduate student has been instrumental in deciding her future plans.\"During my sophomore year, I attended an American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) meeting and Dr. Kamruzzaman gave a speech introducing his research topic. I thought it sounded really interesting, so I contacted him, and that's how I got involved,\" Wu stated. \"I was thinking about going to graduate school, but I wasn't entirely certain. After being engaged in research for several years, I have discovered my passion for it.\"Wu received a U of I Graduate College Illinois Distinguished Fellowship, and upon graduating with her bachelor's degree in May 2023, she will continue directly into a doctoral program in ABE with Kamruzzaman.\"Lisa has done outstanding work with a small grant from the Office of Undergraduate Research. It is truly inspiring for undergraduate students to realize they can do meaningful research and publish their findings. This can serve as motivation for other students to engage with faculty and actively pursue research opportunities. I'm always open to students reaching out to me for potential involvement in research projects,\" Kamruzzaman added.The paper, \"Reagent-free detection of multiple allergens in gluten-free flour using NIR spectroscopy and multivariate analysis,\" is published in the Journal of Food Composition and Analysis.

  "text": "A new study conducted by a team of scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (MPIC) reveals that the adverse health effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are attributable to the conversion of peroxides into more reactive species such as the hydroxyl radical (OH) rather than the direct chemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as previously thought.          In the scientific literature, the total production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2 is commonly used as proxy for the toxicity of air pollutants and their ability to induce oxidative stress and inflammation. The research team led by Thomas Berkemeier from the MPIC in Mainz found that ROS concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the human respiratory tract may be primarily determined by the release of endogenous H2O2 and the inhalation of ambient gas-phase H2O2, while the chemical production of H2O2 through inhaled PM2.5 is less important.\"Based on our simulations, we think that the overall concentrations of these reactive species in the lungs are large anyway, and not directly dependent on levels of air pollution,\" says Dr. Thomas Berkemeier, head of the Chemical Kinetics & Reaction Mechanisms group at the MPIC. They used a computer model to understand the relevant physical, chemical, and biological processes, and quantify the health effects of different types of air pollutants.\"Our new model simulates the chemical reactions that happen in the respiratory tract. For the first time, we included production, diffusion, and removal of hydrogen peroxide from cells and the blood stream into our computer model. This was quite challenging, because it is not so easy to put these processes in biological tissues into equations,\" explains Thomas Berkemeier.New research directions\"The findings of this study suggest that the current paradigms for assessing the differential toxicity of individual PM2.5 components need to be critically reassessed,\" says Prof. Dr. Ulrich P\u00f6schl, Head of the Multiphase Chemistry Department at the MPIC. The study proposed that the chemical production of superoxide and H2O2 in a cell-free assay may not be a suitable metric for assessing the differential toxicity of individual PM2.5 components, and some acellular oxidative potential assays may not capture the actual deleterious effects of PM2.5.Fine particulates might act through Fenton chemistryHowever, the production of hydroxyl radicals (OH) was strongly correlated with Fenton chemistry of PM2.5 in the model calculations. \"The model simulations suggest that PM2.5 mostly acts by conversion of peroxides into highly reactive OH radicals. Thus, PM2.5 is not so much the fuel, but rather the catalyst of the chemical reactions that cause damage to cells and tissues,\" says Berkemeier explaining the role of inhaled particles in the model.Additionally, PM2.5 may stimulate the production of superoxide from endogenous sources, which further contributes to the adverse health effects of air pollution.The study underscores the importance of continued research to better understand the chemical mechanisms underlying the health effects of air pollution and to develop effective strategies to mitigate these effects. The authors believe that this study will contribute significantly to this important research effort. Their findings are published in Environmental Science: Atmospheres.Air pollution is a major health risk that affects millions of people worldwide, but the underlying chemical mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) typically contains chemical components that can trigger oxidation reactions. When inhaled and deposited in the human respiratory tract, they can induce and sustain radical reaction cycles that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) that covers the airways and alveoli in human lungs.Numerous studies have shown that excess concentrations of ROS like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) can cause oxidative stress injuring cells and tissues in the respiratory tract.

  "answer_squad": " CBD",
  "text": "Soon, you'll be able to get a box of freshly picked, sweet strawberries from the grocery store or local farm stand. But it's disappointing when you get them home and find that the ones at the bottom have started to rot. To increase the berries' shelf life, researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces have incorporated cannabidiol\u2014a non-hallucinogenic compound from cannabis known as CBD\u2014and sodium alginate into an edible antimicrobial coating.          CBD is popular because of its potential therapeutic effects. But this cannabinoid has also been shown to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. In previous studies, CBD limited the growth of some bacteria and pathogenic fungi, such as the ones that cause fresh fruits and vegetables to rot.However, the oily compound needs to be evenly distributed in water before it can be widely incorporated into foods or used for food preservation. One possible way to do this is to encapsulate the CBD molecules in edible polymers. So, Pongpat Sukhavattanakul, Sarute Ummartyotin and colleagues wanted to see if a food coating made using CBD-filled nanoparticles could promote antimicrobial activity and extend the freshness of strawberries.The researchers encapsulated CBD in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), a biodegradable polymer used in drug delivery, producing 400-nm-wide particles. They mixed the most stable nanoparticles, containing 20% by weight CBD, with sodium alginate in water. Strawberries were then submerged into solutions containing different amounts of nanoparticles before a second dip into a mixture of ascorbic acid and calcium chloride to turn the colorless coating into a gel.Untreated and treated strawberries were then placed in open plastic containers at refrigerator temperatures. After 15 days, CBD-treated samples ripened and decayed much more slowly than untreated ones, possibly because of reduced microbial growth. The coating with the most CBD-loaded nanoparticles preserved the berries' dark red appearance, enhanced their antioxidant activity the most and exhibited the largest antimicrobial protection over the storage period, suggesting that this version would lead to the longest shelf life.The researchers say that their results demonstrate how encapsulated CBD could be used to create a colorless antimicrobial coating for active food packaging.

  "text": "A group of researchers at Leipzig University has developed a new method for synthesizing cis-tetrahydrocannabinol (cis-THC)\u2014a natural substance found in the cannabis plant that produces the characteristic psychoactive effect and has many potential applications, including in the pharmaceutical industry.          \"Our strategy makes it possible to produce cis-tetrahydrocannabinoids and test them for their biological activity,\" explains researcher Caroline Dorsch, who, together with Professor Christoph Schneider from the Institute of Organic Chemistry, has published her findings in the journal Angewandte Chemie.She points out that until now there has been no way of synthesizing this structural class in a consistent way. With their simple, inexpensive and nature-based synthesis, the Leipzig researchers have for the first time made the substance class of cis-tetrahydrocannabinoids accessible for a broad range of applications. The researcher notes that because previous methods required many steps and large amounts of chemicals and solvents, their approach is clearly superior. The substance can be synthesized with high overall yields and excellent optical purities using the new method.Tetrahydrocannabinol is one of the phytocannabinoids produced in the cannabis plant. These compounds accumulate mainly in the inflorescences of the female plants. It has been known since the 1960s that this also produces the characteristic psychotropic effect in the body.Research into this natural substance led to the elucidation of the underlying mechanism of its action\u2014the endocannabinoid system. This is the term used to describe the signaling pathway in the body that is affected by tetrahydrocannabinol and causes the characteristic effects of smoking marijuana, for example.\"Manipulating this pathway is of pharmaceutical relevance. Cannabinoids can have a variety of effects in the body, for example functioning as painkillers, antipsychotics or anti-epileptics. However, only a few cannabinoids are currently available on the pharmaceutical market. The prescription of natural cannabis products is occasionally viewed as an exception,\" says Dorsch.The possession, cultivation and distribution of narcotic cannabis products is prohibited in Germany under the Narcotics Act (BtMG). Samples containing trans-configured cannabinoids are classified as narcotic. Recent studies have shown that cis-THC accumulates mainly in parts of the cannabis plant where the related trans-compounds are absent. This has so far led to the classification of such samples as textile or non-narcotic hemp. However, cis-THC does have a mild psychotropic effect.THC is a chiral compound. Chirality describes a spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule which cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. The image and mirror image of such compounds are called enantiomers and often have different effects in the human body. While nature can easily control the targeted synthesis of these compounds, this is a major challenge under laboratory conditions\u2014which this work successfully overcomes.The newly developed process also requires very small amounts of catalyst, which is highly attractive from an environmental perspective in terms of saving energy and resources and minimizing by-products.cis-THC has received less research attention than the more potent trans-THC. Nevertheless, other natural substances not derived from cannabis also share a basic structure with cis-THC. These are valuable compounds with promising pharmacological profiles that have yet to be fully explored.The new strategy now presented has laid an important foundation for the more detailed investigation of this family of substances. In addition to cis-THC, a number of other natural and non-natural representatives of this structural class have been produced using this method.

  "text": "In her first publication in the journal Forensic Science International, Ms. Ruby Dixon demonstrated that bacteria can be transferred between a male and female during sexual intercourse and there is a possibility that bacterial colonies may be unique to each individual.          The research was the brainchild of Brendan Chapman, a Senior Lecturer in Forensic Science at Murdoch who has spent more than a decade working with law enforcement at crime scenes and in the laboratory.The pair have coined the bacterial DNA makeup of the sex organs, the \"sexome.\"Identifying the perpetrator of a sexual assault is complex and often requires the analysis of human DNA to catch the offender.But traces of DNA are not always found, such as when semen is not present, making the task all the more difficult for investigators.\"Current techniques for investigating sexual assault work well, however if there aren't enough male cells then there may not be enough to link it to a person using conventional DNA analysis,\" Dixon said.\"This research shows that we can detect that a heterosexual couple has had intercourse based on the bacteria we find after sex.\"Some 'male bacteria' stays on the female and some 'female bacteria' stays on the male.\"The end goal is that we'll be able to take a swab, analyze the bacteria, and link it back to an individual, or at the very least eliminate suspects.\"Dixon explained that even if the bacteria wasn't completely unique to an individual, it would likely be distinct enough to eliminate assault suspects.\"It's like when you buy a packet of M&M's, you know that there are six colors in every packet, so you might say they're identical from the outside,\" she said.\"However, each packet has a different number of each color\u2014one might have five blue, while another only three\u2014and it goes the same for each color.\"It's similar when it comes to bacteria, although male bacteria may look relatively similar at a glance, we found the composition of each person's bacterial makeup is probably different enough to use for identification.\"Chapman said the findings could have a significant real-world impact on investigations.\"This research is a big step forward for forensic science and has the potential to lead to breakthroughs in cases that involve sexual assault,\" he said.\"We've demonstrated the concept, and the plan is to further investigate uniqueness of individual bacterial fingerprints and the effect of things like contraception and non-heterosexual couples.\"The fact is, we have now demonstrated that bacteria may be just as powerful as conventional forensic DNA but with the added benefit of being available even when male human DNA is undetectable.\"Dixon said the next stage of the research will further assess how the new technique can be implemented on a national scale.

  "answer_squad": " waixenicin A",
  "text": "Chemists led by Thomas Magauer at the University of Innsbruck succeeded in synthesizing the natural product waixenicin A for the first time. This molecule is found in soft corals and is of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry due to its potential medical applications. The study is published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.          Soft corals are a rich source of bioactive natural products. The genus Xenia produces the so-called Xenia diterpenoids, which are characterized by their structural complexity and diverse biological activities. Due to their promising activities, pharmaceutical companies are also showing increasing interest in them\u2014some Xenia diterpenoids feature anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, for instance. The first representatives of these substances were isolated as early as 1977, however, they have only been studied to a limited extent.The biggest challenge is the low availability of natural sources. Many marine organisms, including corals, are largely impossible to cultivate. Large-scale extraction of Xenia diterpenoids from corals in nature would represent an enormous impairment of their sensitive ecosystem. Several attempts to produce the complex molecular structures in the laboratory have failed, and to date only a handful syntheses of structurally simplified modifications have been described in the literature.Inhibition of ion channelIn 2014, the group of Thomas Magauer started their research on the synthesis of waixenicin A. The goal was to develop a flexible synthetic strategy to this natural product and to explore its mode of action as well as potential for drug development.Waixenicin A is a unique member of the Xenia diterpenoids and was first isolated from the Hawaiian octocoral Anthelia edmondsoni at Harvard Medical School in 1984. Initial testing in 2011 revealed that waixenicin A is a selective and highly potent inhibitor of the TRPM7 ion channel. Ion channels play an essential role in various biological processes, including neural signaling and the perception of a wide variety of sensations such as heat, taste, and pain.Earlier work on herbicides leads to successMagauer's group finally succeeded in synthesizing waixenicin A in the laboratory in April 2023. The synthesis was very challenging due to the special properties of the natural product but was finally accomplished with the help of an efficient synthetic strategy that Magauer's group had established during previous work in the area of herbicides.Despite early progress and a significant breakthrough in 2017, the desired bicyclic scaffold was not accessible in the laboratory. The presence of several labile functional groups as well as a strained nine-membered ring prevented the successful synthesis for several years.Eventually, a solution based on an earlier study on the synthesis of the herbicide Cornexistin was developed. The use of an intramolecular ring closure enabled efficient assembly of the desired molecular scaffold. Sequential functionalization of a key bicyclic intermediate allowed selective incorporation of the side chain and completed the first synthesis of waixenicin A. Further diversification of the key intermediate provided access to two additional Xenia diterpenoids: 9-Deacetoxy-14,15-deepoxyxeniculine and Xeniafaraunol A. Particularly intriguing was the conversion to Xeniafaraunol A, which could be performed in only one step. The significance of this step for the biosynthesis and the biological activity is yet unexplored, so exciting research questions are guaranteed.The Magauer group is currently optimizing the developed route and is working on the synthesis of a unique substance library. In collaboration with Susanna Zierler's group, the latter will be investigated for its inhibitory effect on the TRPM ion channel. Additional binding studies will provide important insights into the mode of action of this fascinating family of natural products.

  "text": "A research group has developed a neural device that detects specific neurotransmitters in the brain with high sensitivity and selectivity by combining multifunctional fibers and DNA molecular probes. Details of the research were published in the journal Analytical Chemistry on April 24, 2023.          It is estimated that more than a billion people suffer from brain disorders worldwide. Current therapeutic techniques use electrical modalities to establish an interface with the brain. This typically involves electrodes being used to read electrical potential or deliver electrical currents to specific tissues in the body.However, cells inside the brain communicate with one another via chemical signals, and thus researchers have been looking for ways to measure and manipulate both the electrical and chemical signals.One such breakthrough in this regard has been microscopic, thermally-drawn microelectronic fiber-based neural probes that can act as an interface with the brain across electrical, chemical, optical, and mechanical modalities. Still, the capabilities of this technology for studying intrinsic in-brain chemistry have yet to be explored, and few attempts have studied how it could be integrated with multi-modal and multi-level brain studies.\"We expanded the capabilities of the fibers to include neurochemical sensing,\" says Dr. Yuanyuan Guo, associate professor at Tohoku University's Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences (FRIS), and leader of the research group. \"We coupled aptamers, a new type of biosensor comprising a single strand of synthetic DNA with customizable sequences, on the microelectronic fibers. These defined aptamers sense neurochemicals with high sensitivity and high selectivity.\"Aptamers can be thought of as keys that specifically unlock the locks of certain target molecules. Like a key fits into a specific lock and opens it, an aptamer can bind to a specific molecule and interact with it in a selective manner.In the study, the defined aptamer sequences bound to specific molecules with a high affinity, inducing a reversible three-dimensional conformational change from a relatively simple chain structure into a complex structure wrapping around targets. Aptamers were tagged with ferrocene as an electrochemical readout for target molecule and aptamer binding.The research group focused on dopamine due to its physiological significance in mediating learning behavior and motivation. But Guo points out that this sensing mechanism is applicable to other molecules regardless of their charge or electrochemical profile. \"Our discovery provides a universal method for fiber surface modification, to monitor wide-range molecules of interest.\"Ultimately, the breakthrough will hopefully enable the development of new brain research and methods for the prevention and treatment of diseases of the brain and organs that have not been elucidated to date.

  "answer_squad": " Organic chemistry",
  "text": "Organic chemistry, the study of carbon-based molecules, underlies not only the science of living organisms, but is critical for many current and future technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays. Understanding the electronic structure of a material's molecules is key to predicting the material's chemical properties.          In a study recently published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry by researchers at the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, a machine-learning algorithm was developed to predict the density of states within an organic molecule, i.e., the number of energy levels that electrons can occupy in the ground state within a material's molecules. These predictions, based on spectral data, can be of great help to organic chemists and materials scientists when analyzing carbon-based molecules.The experimental techniques often used to find the density of states can be difficult to interpret. This is particularly true for the method known as core-loss spectroscopy, which combines energy loss near-edge spectroscopy (ELNES) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). These methods irradiate a beam of electrons or X-rays at a sample of material; the resulting scatter of electrons and measurements of energy emitted by the material's molecules allow the density of states the molecule of interest to be measured. However, information the spectrum has is only at the electron absent (unoccupied) states of the excited molecules.To address this issue, the team at the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, trained a neural network machine-learning model to analyze the core-loss spectroscopy data and predict the density of electronic states. First, a database was constructed by calculating the densities of states and corresponding core-loss spectra for over 22,000 molecules. They also added some simulated noise. Then, the algorithm was trained on core-loss spectra and optimized to predict the correct density of states of both occupied and unoccupied states at the ground state.\"We attempted to extrapolate predictions for larger molecules using a model trained by smaller molecules. We discovered that the accuracy can be improved by excluding tiny molecules,\" explains lead author Po-Yen Chen.The team also found that by using smoothing preprocessing and adding specific noise to the data, the predictions of density of state can be improved, which can accelerate adoption of the prediction model for use on real data.\"Our work can help researchers understand the material properties of molecules and accelerate the design of functional molecules,\" senior author Teruyasu Mizoguchi says. This can include pharmaceuticals and other exciting compounds. More information:Machine Learning Lets Researchers See Beyond the Spectrum, The Journal of Physical Chemistry (2023).

  "text": "The discovery that zinc is involved in the fertilization process earlier than initially thought was made with the help of the Bionanoprobe, a cutting-edge instrument at Argonne.          To make a baby, first you need an egg. To have an egg, there needs to be a follicle. And in the very beginning of follicle development, there needs to be zinc.The last of those statements represents the new findings reported recently by a team of researchers from Michigan State University, Northwestern University and the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory. The research builds upon earlier work looking at the role of zinc in fertilization and uncovers the importance of the metal earlier in the process of ovulation.The results were reported in a paper in the Journal of Biological Chemistry that looked at the role of zinc in follicle development. The researchers, led by Teresa Woodruff and Tom O'Halloran of Michigan State University, used the Bionanoprobe at Argonne's Advanced Photon Source (APS) to examine zinc and other trace elements in the egg cell itself as well as surrounding somatic cells.The researchers observed that the concentration of zinc in mouse follicles more than triples as they go through their development, while concentrations of other trace elements such as iron and copper increased to a lesser extent. The researchers also noticed that growing follicles acquired zinc at a rate 70 times faster than undeveloped follicles, suggesting a key role for zinc in the maturation of ovarian follicles.\"We had known from earlier research that zinc played an important role in fertilization, but this new research shows that it's involved way before egg meets sperm,\" said Argonne staff scientist Si Chen, an author of the study.\"This study is a beautiful example of how synchrotron-based science can open new fundamental understandings of biology, of reproduction, and of metabolism of disease,\" said Michigan State microbiology professor Tom O'Halloran. \"When you're working with photons and X-ray beams, you might not always initially understand the connection to actual physiology\u2014but this is really at the cutting edge of bringing new tools to the biology community.\"      The Bionanoprobe is one of a few facilities in the world where researchers can measure the concentration of different elements within a cell's organelles in cryogenic conditions, Chen said. \"Being able to resolve subcellular compartments is important for understanding what's going on behind the scenes as the follicle develops,\" she said.The importance of zinc for follicle development is related to the fact that there are zinc-activated proteins that control the process, according to Chen. \"Transient fluctuations in the amount of zinc in a cell can provide important signaling pathways for the next steps in development,\" she said.The researchers also observed that the egg has ways of regulating how much zinc is allocated to specific subcellular locations. \"The zinc levels need to be kept in a certain range for the follicle to develop normally,\" Chen said. \"Just like in the rest of our bodies, there are certain optimal conditions, or homeostasis, that needs to be achieved.\"At the Bionanoprobe, the researchers used X-ray fluorescence microscopy to measure the zinc concentrations.The results may have implications for future studies on human fertility. \"The production of follicles is essential to human reproduction,\" Chen said. \"Gaining a better understanding of how they develop could potentially lead to better reproductive medicine.\"\"There are a lot of mysteries about what the signals are that tell which follicle to mature and be ovulated,\" O'Halloran said. \"This process is rooted in a deeper biological story about which we are just beginning to uncover the foundations.\"According to O'Halloran, the upcoming upgrade of the APS will give scientists access to a more intense beam that will produce a 100 times greater sensitivity to zinc, allowing for an even faster and more precise structural determination of chemical signatures.\"Because there's so much biological variability between cells as they go through differentiation and developmental processes, you need to image a large number of sections to get a statistically representative sample,\" he said. \"With the upgraded APS, we'll have more samples being measured per minute of beam time, with higher sensitivity and better spatial resolution.\" More information:Yu-Ying Chen et al, Zinc dynamics regulate early ovarian follicle development, Journal of Biological Chemistry (2022).

  "text": "Common inflammatory disorders such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease can be diagnosed or monitored by measuring the protein calprotectin in stool samples, while serum levels of calprotectin could be used to monitor the inflammation status in rheumatoid arthritis. Calprotectin concentrations in patient samples are typically determined using antibodies that bind and detect the protein, for example, in lateral flow assays like the now all-too-familiar home COVID-19 test kits.       But there is a problem with antibody-based calprotectin assays: The results can vary depending on the type of antibody and assay used. This happens because antibodies may bind to different sites on the protein, or might not have a uniform composition. The antibodies can also become inactivated over time due to unfolding or precipitation.One possible solution is to use peptides instead of antibodies to detect and measure disease markers like calprotectin. Peptides are sequences of up to 50 amino acids that can bind to proteins with high affinity and selectivity, but unlike antibodies, they can be chemically produced with high purity and homogeneity. In addition, peptides are stable over time, are cheaper to produce than antibodies and with lower inter-batch variability, and they can be attached to a specific location on a surface, significantly simplifying diagnostic assay development because it allows for a more accurate and controlled way of detecting biomarkers.A lateral flow assay for calprotectin. Credit: Christian Heinis (EPFL)/Jo\u00eblle Jourdan (B\u00dcHLMANN AG)With this idea, Christian Gerhold, CTO of the diagnostics company B\u00dcHLMANN, worked with the group of Professor Christian Heinis at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) to develop human calprotectin ligands based on peptides. From a library of more than 500 billion different peptides, Cristina Diaz-Perlas, a postdoc in Heinis's group, isolated several binders of calprotectin, and showed that the peptides are suited for calprotectin quantification in simplified lateral flow assays. The best peptide had a dissociation constant of 26 nM\u2014a measure of how tightly it binds calprotectin, making it a good candidate for diagnostic tests.The peptide not only binds to a large surface region of calprotectin but also to a specific form of calprotectin that is the relevant species in patient samples. Under the guidance of Benjamin Ricken at B\u00dcHLMANN, the peptide was finally tested in professionally assembled lateral flow cassettes and found that it was suited for accurate detection and quantification of calprotectin. In a proof-of-concept study, this setup was used to quantify the concentration of calprotectin in serum obtained from patient blood samples.The peptide developed is the first synthetic affinity reagent that could be generated against the biomarker calprotectin. \"The EPFL and B\u00dcHLMANN teams are currently performing more tests with the calprotectin-specific peptide to translate the assay into a product that can bring the diagnostic power of this increasingly important biomarker to a new level to help patients suffering from inflammatory diseases,\" says Christian Heinis.Christian Gerhold adds, \"This collaboration greatly benefited from B\u00dcHLMANN's knowhow to produce and handle the biomarker, and expertise of the EPFL team to generate and screen large combinatorial libraries of peptides by phage display.\" More information:Cristina D\u00edaz-Perlas, High-affinity peptides developed against calprotectin and their application as synthetic ligands in diagnostic assays., Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "Research has shown that a thin cellulose film can inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus within minutes, inhibit the growth of bacteria including E. coli, and mitigate contact transfer of pathogens.          The coating consists of a thin film of cellulose fiber that is invisible to the naked eye, and is abrasion-resistant under dry conditions, making it suitable for use on high traffic objects such as door handles and handrails.The coating was developed by scientific teams from the University of Birmingham, Cambridge University, and FiberLean Technologies, who worked on a project to formulate treatments for glass, metal or laminate surfaces that would deliver long-lasting protection against the COVID-19 virus.While conventional chemical disinfectants and antiviral surface designs target either the structural proteins or nucleic acids, the researchers, led by Professor Zhenyu Jason Zhang, from Birmingham's School of Chemical Engineering, focused on drying out the respiratory droplets that contain the viruses by the capillary force introduced by the porous structure.The COVID-19 virus is known to remain active for several days on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel, but for only a few hours on newspaper. The team, which has expertise in surface chemistry and formulation engineering, investigated the structure and performance of a coating made from micro-fibrillated cellulose (MFC) provided by FiberLean Technologies, the leading global producer of MFC for the paper and packaging industry.The researchers found that the porous nature of the film plays a significant role: it accelerates the evaporation rate of liquid droplets, and introduces an imbalanced osmotic pressure across bacteria membrane.They then tested whether the coating could inhibit surface transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Here they found a three-fold reduction of infectivity when droplets containing the virus were left on the coating for 5 minutes, and, after 10 minutes, the infectivity fell to zero.By contrast when droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 were left on a glass surface, their initial infectivity was still maintained after 10 minutes. The antimicrobial tests were repeated with droplets containing bacteria (E. coli and S. epidermidis), and here again, the researchers saw substantial reductions in infectivity at 1 hour and 24 hours.The experiments were repeated with aerosolized artificial saliva, and here the analysis suggested that the cellulose thin film is also effective in suppressing the contact transfer of respiratory aerosols.Professor Zhang commented, \"The risk of surface transmission, as opposed to aerosol transmission, comes from large droplets which remain infective if they land on hard surfaces, where they can be transferred by touch. This surface coating technology uses sustainable materials and could potentially be used in conjunction with other antimicrobial actives to deliver a long-lasting and slow-release antimicrobial effect.\"The researchers confirmed the stability of the coating by mechanical scraping tests, where the coating showed no noticeable damage when dry, but easy removal from the surface when wetted, making it convenient and suitable for daily cleaning and disinfection practice.The paper is published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.

Therefore, two clearly distinct radical signals were observed in the high-field/-frequency single-crystal EPR spectra of a VT complex for the first time.In their strategy, a pyridyl derivative of a diarylethene (DAE) ligand was used as the linker along with the Co-dioxolene unit, which is a classical VT building block, to form a VT CP with a chain structure. Light may promote the rearrangement of the crystal structure and further influence magnetic properties through modification of the ligand field (isomers differ substantially in shape and conjugation), leading to photocontrol and deep insight into organic radicals on a 1D chain.An open-form and a closed-form complex were synthesized. Photoconversion between the open- and closed-form species (ligands and complexes) due to the effect of DAE ligand photoisomerization was explored through UV/vis absorption spectroscopy.Notably, the 1D chains in the two types of complexes differ due to the open and closed forms of the 6F-DAE-py2 ligand. The open-form complex exhibits a zigzag 1D structure, while the closed-form complex displays quasi-linear characteristics. In the study of SC-XRD, two types of crystallographically distinct SQ\u00b7\u2013 radicals, referred to as Radical 1 and Radical 2, are observed in the chains of the open-form complex due to their zigzag configurations.They used high-field (~13.3 T) and -frequency (~360 GHz) single-crystal EPR spectroscopy to significantly enhance the resolution of Zeeman splitting in the open-form complex, which led to the observation of a remarkable phenomenon. Dual SQ\u00b7\u2013 radical signals were directly visualized when the c-axis was aligned with the static field.Furthermore, angle-dependent EPR spectroscopy was carried out. The directional variations of these dual radicals, as well as their 180\u00b0 periods, were confirmed. To conveniently investigate the two directional radicals, they determined the face index of a single crystal of the open-form complex. In this way, they confirmed the gz value of Radical 1 and distinguished the g1 and g2 values obtained in high-field and high-frequency EPR spectroscopy.Interestingly, a synergistic effect between valence tautomerism and semi-conductivity was found in magnetic and electronic studies. Electrical conductivity increased with increasing temperature below the transition temperature, which is a characteristic semiconductor behavior. However, electrical conductivity was observed to decrease with increasing temperature above 330 K, which is ascribable to electron transfer during valence tautomerism.Such behavior was observed for the first time in a single-crystal VT complex. The Arrhenius analysis determined the origin of the semiconductive behavior before 330 K, while DFT calculations helped illustrate the mechanism of the unusual change in electrical conductivity during the VT transition process.This study presents the first example of dual-radical-based molecular anisotropy and charge-transfer-induced conductive anisotropy in a photoswitchable coordination polymer. It is of considerable significance with regard to the anisotropy and synthesis of multifunctional bistable magnetic materials in the molecular magnetism field.

  "text": "Don't be surprised to see pills with unusual shapes in the future. At first sight they may look funny, but they can release pharmaceuticals inside the body in a controlled manner. Using a combination of advanced computational methods and 3D printing, objects can be produced that dissolve in liquids in a predetermined format.          A group of Computer Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany, and the University of California at Davis, have invented a process that relies solely on the shape of the object for a time-controlled release. This will have important implications for the pharmaceutical industry, which has recently begun focusing sharply on 3D printing.Funny looking pills are not a design gimmick, they can release medication in a desired time regime. Controlling pharmaceutical drug levels in patients is an important part of medication. In the case of intravenous infusion, the concentration in the blood is determined by the drip rate multiplied with the proportion of the drug in the IV solution. A constant drug level might be achieved by initially administrating a large dose and maintaining it from then on by smaller doses. With oral administration, this regime is much more difficult to ensure.One idea would be to use multi-component, multi-material structures with different drug concentrations at different locations, which is difficult to manufacture. On the other hand, great advances in 3D printing and its insurmountable capabilities for creating complex shapes, making free-form drugs with a constant distribution of the biochemical in the carrier material is currently a viable option. For such drugs, the release depends solely on the geometric shape, which is easier to ensure and control.The project, led by Dr. Vahid Babaei (MPI for Informatics) and Prof. Julian Panetta (UC Davis), produces 3D objects that dissolve in a desired function of time, hence releasing their content in a controlled way. By cleverly combining mathematical modeling, experimental setup and 3D printing, the team can print 3D shapes that deliver a timed amount of drug as they dissolve. This can be used to set predetermined drug concentrations through oral delivery.Since no external influence is possible after ingestion in the digestive tract, the desired time-dependent drug release must be generated by the shape (active surface that dissolves) of the specimen. With some effort, the time-dependent dissolution can be calculated from a given geometric shape. For a sphere, for example, it is strictly proportional to the decreasing spherical surface.      The research team proposes a forward simulation, based on a geometric intuition that objects are dissolved one layer at a time. Practitioners are, however, mostly interested in defining a desired release first and then finding a shape that dissolves according to that release profile. Even with this efficient forward simulation, the reverse engineering to find the appropriate three-dimensional shape for a desired drug regime has significant difficulties.This is where topology optimization (TO) finds application: forward simulations are inverted to find a shape that exhibits a certain property. Originally developed for mechanical components, TO has meanwhile gained a wide range of applications. The team is the first to propose an inverse design strategy to find the shape from release behavior based on topology optimization. The dissolution is validated by means of experiments: the measured release curves are very close to the desired values.In the experimental setup, the objects are printed using a filament based 3D printer. The dissolution is then evaluated by a camera system, i.e., actually measured, not just calculated by a mathematical model. For this purpose, the optical transmittance of the solvent is optically recorded. In contrast to the measurement methods commonly used to date, which directly determine the active ingredient concentration (e.g., by titrating), this method is much faster and simpler to set up. Optical methods for measuring the density of active ingredients have, by the way, been in use for quite some time: when grapes are mashed for making wine, the sugar content (\u00d6chsle) of the grape juice is determined by refractometry.The inverse design method can also incorporate different fabricability constraints of different manufacturing systems. For example, it can be modified to generate extruded shapes and thus does not stand in the way of mass production. Beyond the discussed application in pharmaceutics, further possibilities include the production of catalytic bodies or even coarse granular fertilizers.

  "text": "In the face of increasing global scarcity of freshwater resources, desalination is considered one of the most effective ways to alleviate this problem. However, it does come with a catch\u2014efficient and low-cost evaporation materials are key to achieving large-scale applications.          Hydrogels present a promising opportunity, yet conventional uses of these in interfacial solar evaporators still lack the ability to satisfy the trade-off for high evaporation rate, salt resistance and durable mechanical properties.Therefore, most traditional hydrogel materials are only suitable for low-salinity brine, far from the requirements of long-term evaporation and treatment of industrial high-salinity wastewater. It has been demonstrated that the salt resistance of hydrogels can be enhanced by constructing interpenetrating 3D macropore structure.Nonetheless, rapid water transport and high water content can lead to increased conductive heat loss. This problem can be solved by further designing the Janus structure. Furthermore, although various methods for creating such structures exist, they are often complex and lack surface stability.To that end, a team of researchers from the School of Chemical Engineering and Technology at Hebei University of Technology in Tianjin, China, introduced hydrophobic fumed nano-silica aerogel (SA) into the hydrogel production process. The ultra-lightweight and super-hydrophobic properties of SA enable it to spontaneously migrate and aggregate to the upper region of the hydrogel during the gelation process, forming a Janus structure.\"We know that the regulation of pore structure can also balance the problem of increased heat loss caused by the high salt resistance of the sponge-like hydrogel,\" explained Aqiang Chu, lead author of the study published in Green Energy & Environment. \"Consequently, we incorporated agar (AG) to enhance the comprehensive performance of hydrogel evaporators.\"Notably, AG has a thickening function, which in this case stabilizes the bubble structure formed during the foaming process, and thus help regulate the pore structure of the hydrogel.\"The large number of hydroxyl groups on the AG chain can at once reduce the enthalpy of water evaporation by interacting with water and forming ether bonds with polyvinyl alcohol to form a robust cross-linked network, contributing to improved mechanical properties,\" Chu explained further.\"Coupled with the low cost and environmental friendliness of these preparation materials, our Janus dual-network sponge-like hydrogel solar evaporator shows great potential for practical applications in the field of interfacial solar evaporation,\" added corresponding author Hao Li.

The China-led team said the dye, which has yet to be tested as an antidote on humans but has already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for other uses, has the potential to \"save many lives\".Amanita phalloides, commonly known as death caps, are estimated to cause more than 90 percent of all deaths from mushroom poisoning worldwide.They often resemble other species of mushrooms that people like to pick in the wild\u2014but eating just half of one can cause deadly failure of the liver or kidneys.While originally native to Europe, death caps have spread across the world, causing more than 38,000 illnesses and nearly 800 deaths in China alone between 2010 and 2020.For a new study published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers sought to target alpha-amanitin, the main toxin produced by the mushrooms.They used genome-wide CRISPR screening, a relatively new technique that has helped researchers understand the role specific genes play in infections and poisonings.The team had previously used the technology to find a potential antidote for the box jellyfish, one of the world's most venomous animals.The CRISPR screening identified that the protein STT3B was a key culprit in the toxic effects of death cap poisoning.The team searched through a database of drugs already approved by the US FDA and found one that could potentially block the protein.'Unexpected connection'It is a fluorescent dye called indocyanine green, which is administered intravenously. It has been widely used for decades in the US, Europe and elsewhere for diagnostic imaging, allowing doctors to measure liver and heart function.Qiaoping Wang, a researcher at China's Sun Yat-sen University and senior author of the study, told AFP that \"upon discovering this unexpected connection, the research team was understandably taken aback\".The team tested the antidote first on liver cells in a petri dish, then on mice.In both cases, it \"demonstrated significant potential in mitigating the toxic impact\" of mushroom poisoning, Wang said.\"This molecule holds immense potential for treating cases of human mushroom poisoning and could mark the first-ever specific antidote with a targeted protein,\" he said.\"It could save many lives if it is as effective in humans as in mice.\"The team now intends to conduct trials on humans using the dye as a death cap antidote.An extract from milk thistle seeds called silibinin has previously been used to treat death cap poisoning, but exactly how it works has remained unclear.

  "text": "While many materials melt when heated, researchers from Japan recently discovered a novel material in which melting can be induced by ultraviolet light instead of heat. Even more intriguing, this material exhibits changes in its luminescent properties while it melts. This material is the first organic crystalline material found to show changes in luminescent color and intensity upon ultraviolet light-induced melting.          Investigators from Osaka University reported their discovery of this new class of photo-responsive crystal compounds, \"heteroaromatic 1,2-diketones,\" in Chemical Science on April 20. Light irradiation causes the crystals in these materials to melt, a phenomenon termed photo-induced crystal-to-liquid transition (PCLT).This phenomenon can dramatically change a material's properties and makes possible a broad range of applications, for example, photo-responsive, reversible adhesives that could be controlled by light. Few materials have been shown to have this crystal-melting property; hence, the discovery of a new class of PCLT materials is a great step forward in this field.In characterizing their newly discovered class of PCLT materials, the researchers found that one member of this class, the diketone SO, shows changes in luminescence during the irradiation-induced melting process. \"This is the first organic crystal we know of that exhibits a luminescent evolution during crystal melting, showing changes in intensity and color, from green to yellow,\" says lead author Mao Komura.Real-time observation of crystal melting with luminescence evolution. Credit: Osaka UniversityThese changes in luminescence, i.e., changes in the way the material absorbs and emits light, indicated that SO was undergoing molecular-level changes in shape during the PCLT process. Building upon past research on luminescent molecules, the research team realized they could further investigate these molecular-level changes underlying PCLT to better understand the crystal-melting phenomenon.\"We found that the changes in luminescence arise from sequential processes of crystal loosening and conformational changes prior to melting,\" explains senior author Yosuke Tani. \"These visual indications of the steps of the PCLT process enabled us to advance the current understanding of crystal melting at the molecular level.\"By applying single-crystal X-ray analysis, thermodynamic property analysis, and theoretical calculations to probe the mechanisms governing the behavior of this new PCLT material, the researchers demonstrated that a disordered layer in the crystal is a key factor for PCLT in this class of materials.

  "text": "Researchers at Kanazawa University report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences high-speed atomic force microscopy experiments that show how ligands associated with stimulating and suppressing activation of the TRPV1 protein increase and decrease the molecule's structural variations. The observations provide insights into how these heat- and chili-sensing proteins function.          The skin senses heat\u2014both from increased temperature and molecules like capsaicin in chilies\u2014through the activation of protein receptors called Transient receptor potential vanilloid member 1 (TRPV1). However, the mechanisms behind the function of TRPV1 have not been clear. Now Ayumi Sumino at Kanazawa University in Japan and Motoyuki Hattori at the Fudan University in China and their colleagues provide important insights into this mechanism.Using high-speed atomic force microscopy to compare the protein with and without stimulating or suppressing molecules\u2014ligands\u2014bound to it, they obtain what they describe as \"the first experimental evidence showing the correlation between molecular fluctuation and the gating state (ligand binding).\"Once activated, the TRPV1 channel opens, allowing ions to permeate and signaling to the nervous system that a noxious stimulant is present. In 2011 researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the U.S. put forward a theoretical basis for the activation of the receptor derived from thermodynamics, a theoretical framework that has since been corroborated by experiment.The idea was that the molecule would respond to heat with a change in heat capacity, which is related to the fluctuations in the molecule's conformation. Structures for the TRPV1 protein were known from previous cryo electron microscopy studies but these did not clarify how the fluctuations in protein conformation might change with stimulating or suppressing molecules, or even whether temperature and chili sensing shared the same molecular mechanism.Atomic force microscopy (AFM) senses the topology of surfaces through the effect of distance on the forces on a nanosized tip positioned directly above the surface. The microscope was first invented in 1986 but was revived through work at Kanazawa University that enabled it to capture topologies at high speed thereby providing a window into the dynamics of structures.Sumino, Hattori and colleagues used high-speed AFM to image the TRPV1 receptor both in its unbound state and when bound to ligand molecules that either stimulate (agonist) or suppress (antagonist) the protein's activity. They used the molecule resiniferatoxin, which is 1,000 times hotter than capsaicin, as the agonist and for the antagonist they used capsazepine, which blocks the pain of capsaicin.From the structures captured the researchers were able to observe fluctuations in the conformation of both the bound and unbound states of TRPV1. They found that resiniferatoxin increases conformational fluctuations, while capsazepine suppresses them.Although the conformational fluctuations were very small\u2014at around an Angstrom\u2014the researchers highlight evidence in the literature of conformational changes at this scale being sufficient to affect the ion permeability of a channel. In their report of the work, the researchers conclude, \"Overall, this study suggests the importance of structural fluctuation, which would be a key factor for the heat-sensing of TRPV1.\" More information:Ayumi Sumino et al, Antithetic effects of agonists and antagonists on the structural fluctuations of TRPV1 channel, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

  "answer_squad": " pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rhodium complex",
  "text": "Hydrogen, the simplest element on Earth, is a clean fuel that could revolutionize the energy industry. Accessing hydrogen, however, is not a simple or clean process at all. Pure hydrogen is extremely rare in nature, and practical methods to produce it currently rely on fossil fuels. But if scientists find the right chemical catalyst, one that can split the hydrogen and oxygen in water molecules apart, pure hydrogen could be produced from renewable energy sources such as solar power.          Now, scientists are one step closer to finding that catalyst. Chemists at the University of Kansas and the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory have unraveled the entire reaction mechanism for a key class of water-splitting catalysts. Their work was published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\"It's very rare that you can get a complete understanding of a full catalytic cycle,\" said Brookhaven chemist Dmitry Polyansky, a co-author of the paper. \"These reactions go through many steps, some of which are very fast and cannot be easily observed.\"Rapid intermediate steps make it difficult for scientists to decipher exactly where, when, and how the most important parts of a catalytic reaction occur\u2014and therefore, if the catalyst is suitable for large-scale applications.At the University of Kansas, associate professor James Blakemore was researching possible candidates when he noticed something unusual about one catalyst in particular. This catalyst, called a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rhodium complex, or Cp*Rh complex, was demonstrating reactivity in an area where molecules are usually stable.\"Metal complexes\u2014molecules that contain a metal center surrounded by an organic scaffold\u2014are important for their ability to catalyze otherwise difficult reactions,\" said Blakemore, who is also a co-author of the paper. \"Typically, reactivity happens directly at the metal center, but in our system of interest, the ligand scaffold appeared to directly take part in the chemistry.\"So, what exactly was reacting with the ligand? Was the team really observing an active step in the reaction mechanism or just an undesirable side reaction? How stable were the intermediate products that were produced? To answer questions like these, Blakemore collaborated with chemists at Brookhaven Lab to use a specialized research technique called pulse radiolysis.Pulse radiolysis harnesses the power of particle accelerators to isolate rapid, hard-to-observe steps within a catalytic cycle. Brookhaven's Accelerator Center for Energy Research (ACER) is one of only two locations in the United States where this technique can be conducted, thanks to the Lab's advanced particle accelerator complex.      \"We accelerate electrons, which carry significant energy, to very high velocities,\" said Brookhaven chemist David Grills, another co-author of the paper. \"When these electrons pass through the chemical solution we're studying, they ionize the solvent molecules, generating charged species that are intercepted by the catalyst molecules, which rapidly alter in structure. We then use time-resolved spectroscopy tools to monitor the chemical reactivity after this rapid change occurs.\"Spectroscopic studies provide spectral data, which can be thought of as the fingerprints of a molecule's structure. By comparing these signatures to known structures, scientists can decipher physical and electronic changes within the short-lived intermediate products of catalytic reactions.\"Pulse radiolysis allows us to single out one step and look at it on a very short timescale,\" Polyansky said. \"The instrumentation we used can resolve events at one millionth to one billionth of a second.\"By combining pulse radiolysis and time-resolved spectroscopy with more common electrochemistry and stopped-flow techniques, the team was able to decipher every step of the complex catalytic cycle, including the details of the unusual reactivity occurring at the ligand scaffold.\"One of the most remarkable features of this catalytic cycle was direct involvement of the ligands,\" Grills said. \"Often, this area of the molecule is just a spectator, but we observed reactivity within the ligands that had not yet been proven for this class of compounds. We were able to show that a hydride group, an intermediate product of the reaction, jumped onto the Cp* ligand. This proved that the Cp* ligand was an active part of the reaction mechanism.\"Capturing these precise chemical details will make it significantly easier for scientists to design more efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for producing pure hydrogen.The researchers also hope their findings will provide clues for deciphering reaction mechanisms for other classes of catalysts.\"In chemistry, findings like ours can often be generalized and applied to optimize other systems, but obtaining critical details on rapid reactivity, like we have done here, is a key step,\" Blakemore said. \"We hope other research groups will take our insights and build on them, perhaps by using ligand-promoted reactivity to build better catalysts.\"This study is just one set of experiments among a large body of clean energy work that scientists at the University of Kansas and Brookhaven Lab are conducting.\"We're building the fundamental chemical knowledge that will, one day, help scientists design the optimal catalyst for producing pure hydrogen,\" Polyansky said.

Each isotope, having a different weight, travels through the field at a slightly different radius, allowing the different isotopes to be collected separately.The technology was developed to fill a gap left by the 1998 closure of the Manhattan Project-era calutron facility at Y-12, which produced the now-dwindling U.S. stockpile of stable isotopes. EMIS development is intended to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign suppliers for rare, hard-to-produce stable isotopes. EMIS now can match or exceed the quality of isotopes produced at the calutrons.Egle came to ORNL in 2010 to work on the first-generation of EMIS, still in use at the lab. He's since worked on second- and third-generation EMIS\u2014each better than the last, he said.While the original EMIS could separate isotopes of any element at decent resolution, the third-generation machine is optimized for separating elements at the heavier end of the periodic table, such as ytterbium, whose isotope Yb-176 is used in nuclear medicine and radiography.Moreover, it can separate all the isotopes of ytterbium simultaneously, whereas the calutrons went through a series of separations and were able to capture only every other isotope\u2014even or odd numbers.Other isotopes of ytterbium, for example, are used in quantum memory, Egle said. EMIS-3 can produce them all. That's important because particular isotopes with no previously known use may be crucial in the future.\"Things that were not the target isotope 40 years ago that we have in inventory can all of a sudden become the enabler for future science,\" Egle said. \"We absolutely never throw any isotopes away if we can help it.\"                In 2018, ORNL's EMIS produced 500 milligrams of the rare isotope ruthenium-96, unavailable anywhere else in the world. Credit: ORNL/U.S. Dept. of Energy             Unlike the calutrons, EMIS are automated, so the associated labor cost is expected to be lower. And while the calutrons were linked together, each EMIS can run independently, so multiple isotopes can be produced at the same time\u2014for example, a medical isotope alongside a national security isotope such as nickel-63, used for detecting explosives at airports.\"At DOE's discretion, we could have three machines running ytterbium, three running nickel, and one running a small amount of a rare isotope needed for research,\" Egle said. \"They're all independent machines that can be doing independent missions in the same facility simultaneously.\"EMIS features prominently in plans for the Stable Isotope Production and Research Center, or SIPRC, a new facility under construction now and expected to be operational by 2030. Its flexibility makes it a perfect complement to the gaseous centrifuge isotope separators, or GCIS, the lab is developing for multiple isotopes. Self-sufficient GCIS, which also will be used in SIPRC, can produce high volumes of isotopes at a low cost. But changing GCIS from one isotope to another is a process that can take years, whereas EMIS can switch from producing one isotope to another in a matter of weeks.\"The EMIS fills a boutique, niche market: milligrams-to-grams scale at very high enrichments, with high flexibility where we can switch across the whole periodic table relatively rapidly,\" Egle said.Development of EMIS-3 went smoothly, Egle said, because of adequate funding\u2014including the renovation of a facility specifically for its production\u2014and because of the expertise and skilled workforce ORNL grew while developing the first two generations.\"We didn't just copy this out of a book,\" he said. \"This is knowledge that we've built and a knowledge base that can be taken to the next level, whatever the next level is.\"The lab also has established relationships with vendors to produce the ORNL-designed components for EMIS-3. Egle said parts for the technology come from as near as a small, family-owned electronics company in nearby Blount County, and as far away as an electromagnet facility in New Zealand. Vendors send fully integrated modules to ORNL to be assembled into the complete machine.\"The nice thing about EMIS-3 is that it's a very solid platform for further development,\" Egle said. \"It's extremely modular, and that gives the design a lot of flexibility. When you're looking at the whole periodic table, flexibility is very important. If we need to add additional safety engineering controls for different toxicities or hazards, that's easily done.\"Egle is excited about the potential for future generations of EMIS\u2014and for that matter, about ORNL's stable isotope program in general.\"The stable isotope program is absolutely fascinating; it enables so many different things,\" he said. \"You get to come to work and say, 'Do I want to work on curing cancer, basic science, national security\u2026?' You can pretty much touch it all during the course of a day in the stable isotope program. You can see that in our staff. People say, 'Wow, you guys are very excited about what you do.' It's easy to get excited about a mission space like that.\" Provided byOak Ridge National LaboratoryCitation:An electromagnetic isotope separator that continues to improve (2023, May 15)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-electromagnetic-isotope.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs) are a family of enigmatic proteins involved in cell growth and metabolism present in various species. From humans to fruit flies, they play a unique role in the growth of cancerous tumors and the spread of cancer throughout the body. New research emerging from McGill University is contributing to what is known about PRLs, which could potentially become an important tool in the development of cancer-fighting treatments.       Led by Kalle Gehring, a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and founding director of the McGill Centre for Structural Biology, the researchers focused on unraveling the mystery around PRLs. \"It's important for us to study PRLs because they are so important in cancer,\" said Gehring, \"In some cancers such as metastatic colorectal cancer, the proteins are overexpressed up to 300-fold.\"Published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Prof. Gehring and his colleagues (with data collected at the Canadian Light Source (CLS) at the University of Saskatchewan) confirmed that not only PRLs exist in all kinds of single- and multi-cell animals, but that the role of PRLs in binding magnesium transporters is common among all studied species.This overexpression of PRLs makes cancer cells more metastatic and drives the spread to other organs. This data could help to further the understanding of how these proteins influence human disease.\"What we learned is that they all bind the magnesium transporters in the same way,\" says Gehring. \"We're excited because it helps us understand this pathway, and that will reveal new targets for drugs to prevent cancer progression.\" More information:Rayan Fakih et al, Burst kinetics and CNNM binding are evolutionarily conserved properties of phosphatases of regenerating liver, Journal of Biological Chemistry (2023).

  "answer_race": " CDs can be used to stabilize drug supersaturation.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the enclosing cavity in a CD?",
  "answer_squad": " hydrophobic cavity",
  "text": "In the medicine market, most newly introduced drugs and drug candidates show poor water solubility, which prevents their absorption in the body. This, in turn, limits their therapeutic efficiency. Solubilizing agents such as cyclodextrins (CDs) are commonly employed to enhance their solubility.          CDs have a cyclic structure featuring a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic cavity inside that can enclose drug molecules to form inclusion complexes. However, solubilization does not necessarily enhance drug adsorption in the body, since the solubilized drugs cannot readily pass through biological membranes.One way to improve the permeability of drugs through biological membranes is by increasing their concentration in the solution to form a supersaturated state. However, supersaturated states are unstable as the drug tends to precipitate and form crystals, limiting its effectiveness.To prevent this, the addition of effective crystallization inhibitors is necessary to stabilize drug supersaturation over a long period. CD derivatives are particularly advantageous as they can solubilize drugs as well as inhibit their crystallization. However, the mechanism underlying their crystallization inhibition effect remains poorly understood.In this light, a study led by researchers from Chiba University, Japan, recently investigated the impact of 12 different CD derivatives with varying hydrophobic cavity sizes on crystallization inhibition of two poorly water-soluble drugs\u2014carvedilol (CVD) and chlorthalidone (CLT).Their work was published in the International Journal of Pharmaceutics. It involved contributions from Professor Kunikazu Moribe, Associate Professor Kenjirou Higashi, and Assistant Professor Keisuke Ueda.\"Different solubilization abilities of CD derivatives lead to different drug supersaturation levels, resulting in a misestimation of their crystallization inhibition strength. Thus, a systematic analysis of the drug crystallization inhibition effect while considering the solubilization effect of CD derivatives is essential,\" explains lead author Mengyao Liu, a Ph.D. student at the Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology at the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Chiba University.The researchers evaluated the solubilization and crystal inhibition effect of each CD derivative on the two drugs by performing phase solubility tests and measuring the crystallization induction time\u2014the time taken for a supersaturated solution to form crystals. In a phase solubility test, they dissolved the drugs in CD derivative solutions of different concentrations and examined their solubility.For measuring the crystallization induction time, the researchers added the drugs in drops to form supersaturated solutions and then analyzed their concentrations at different time intervals after removing the precipitated crystals.The phase solubility tests revealed that the addition of \u03b2-CD and \u03b3-CD derivatives improved the solubility of CVD. However, CLT's solubility was enhanced only by the \u03b2-CD derivative. \"Notably, the degree of solubility improvement depends on the ability to form stable inclusion complexes that, in turn, depends on the size fitness between the drug molecule and the CD cavity,\" explains Prof. Moribe.However, there was no correlation between the solubilization effect of the different CD derivations and their crystallization inhibition abilities. Moreover, methylated CD derivatives were more effective than their unmethylated counterparts in maintaining the supersaturated state. The researchers attributed the crystallization inhibition ability of the methylated CD derivatives to their highly hydrophobic outer surfaces, which sterically hinder the nucleation and crystal growth processes, and thus maintain the supersaturated state.\"We have discovered a novel function of methylated CD derivatives as effective stabilizers for supersaturated drugs, an effect that is independent of their inclusion complex formation ability,\" says Prof. Moribe.In conclusion, these findings shed light on the potential application of CD derivatives in drug-supersaturated formulations, which, in turn, could facilitate the clinical use of poorly water-soluble drug candidates.

  "answer_squad": " monomers",
  "text": "A program to advance the discovery of new polymers has been developed by a team of interdisciplinary researchers across King's Faculty of Natural, Mathematical and Engineering Sciences. The software, called PySoftK, uses AI to identify new polymer materials, which could be used across a wide range of applications including in medical technology, pharmaceuticals, energy storage and more. The software is described in a paper available on the chemRxiv pre-print server, and PySoftK is available on GitHub.          Professor Chris Lorenz from the Department of Physics and lead researcher on the technology said, \"PySoftK will allow us to accelerate the development of novel polymers for a whole range of applications, from using polymers with embedded nanoparticles to stitch human tissue together, to improving energy storage methods. These materials will help form a building block to tackle large scale challenges that we face in health care, in developing biodegradable home and personal care products and in creating more environmentally friendly energy storage systems.\"Polymers are large molecules made up of smaller repeating molecules called monomers, which bond together in a chain-like fashion to form a long polymer molecule. Polymers can be naturally occurring, such as proteins and DNA, or they can be synthetic, such as plastics and synthetic fibers. This new software development could change the way we investigate the relationship between the chemical structure and function of new polymeric materials, by providing a robust dataset for researchers to train artificial intelligence (AI) to identify desirable polymer properties.Synthetic polymers can be designed to interact with changes in their environment or make use of certain properties. For example, Gore-Tex, a polymer used in clothing was developed as an improvement to nylon, a traditional polymer. While both materials are waterproof, Gore-Tex is also be breathable, because it has been designed with a particular chemical property to perform a specific function. This is known as a designer polymer.Other areas where designer polymers are used, include medical ointments, paints, coatings, food packaging, biomedical imaging and energy storage. Designer polymers have the potential to have a wide range of different functions due to their underlying physical and chemical properties, which originate from the type and arrangement of monomers that build the polymer.To advance our discovery of these types of materials, high-performance computers (HPCs) are used to simulate and predict the behavior of polymers, which then informs researchers how best to build polymers with the desired properties for fulfilling certain tasks.      Over the past several decades, molecular scale simulations, computer simulations representing 3D structures of molecules, have improved our understanding of the relationship between chemical structure and function in increasingly complex polymers. However, more recent advances in computing power and computational algorithms have enabled scientists to investigate more complex systems and provide more accurate predictions using molecular-scale simulations at speed. This can lead to faster and more cost-effective design of materials, as less time is devoted to rounds of experimentation.Lorenz suggests, \"Normally, maintaining a large, diverse and accurate molecular database can be a hugely costly and time intensive process, as researchers race to label and categorize models correctly.\"By offering a set of tools and programming modules to automate the process of curating, modeling and creating libraries of polymers, PySoftK facilitates the generation of large databases on which to train future machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. This allows researchers to move their focus away from exhaustive library maintenance and onto discovering new materials.\"Dr. Alejandro Santana Bonilla, research software engineer within the Faculty of Natural, Mathematical and Engineering Sciences, and one of the lead researchers on the project said, \"The software package is versatile, flexible, and easy to install. It can generate a wide range of polymer topologies and perform library generation in a fully parallelized manner, making it highly efficient,\"Researchers hope that these models will be the driving force of new designer polymer development. PySoftK could also play a significant role for researchers in nano- and bio-technology, who are searching for new functional materials. But without reliable data to train the AI, they risk making inaccurate predictions.\"Ultimately, the integration of molecular scale simulations and machine learning into the rational design process for designer polymers will be vital to furthering our understanding between the chemical structure and function of complex materials,\" says Lorenz.

  "text": "Plants are impressive in their diversity, but especially in the variety of metabolites they produce. Many plant natural products are highly complex molecules, such as the alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, which are produced by the Madagascar periwinkle Catharanthus roseus. These two substances are already indispensable in cancer therapy.          Researchers are very interested in finding out which individual biosynthetic steps are required to form the complex molecules. \"Currently, these compounds are still obtained in very small quantities from the plant's leaf extract. We can learn from the plant how this compound is produced and use this knowledge to develop production systems that are more cost-effective, scalable and sustainable,\" said first author Chenxin Li of the University of Georgia's Center for Applied Genetic Technologies, describing the research goal. The study is published in the journal Nature Chemical Biology.Assigning genetic and metabolic information to individual cells of plant organsThe scientists know that gene activity is not the same in all cells of a plant and that the chemistry can differ drastically from cell to cell. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to use a new set of methods collectively termed single-cell omics to investigate specialized and rare cell types that play a central role in the biosynthesis of plant natural products, and whose signals are often obscured by more abundant cell types in plant organs.\"With single-cell omics, we have a method that allows researchers to assign genetic and metabolic information to individual cells. The term omics refers to the fact that an entire collection of genes or metabolites is quantified and analyzed,\" says Lorenzo Caputi, head of the Alkaloid Biosynthesis Project Group in the Department of Natural Product Biosynthesis in Jena and one of the lead authors.Biosynthetic pathway of vinblastine is organized in three distinct cell typesAs the analyses showed, the entire biosynthetic pathway for the alkaloid vinblastine is organized in three stages and three discrete cell types. \"The first stage is expressed exclusively in specialized cells associated with vascular bundles in the leaf, called IPAP. The second stage of the biosynthetic pathway is expressed only in cells of the epidermis, the layer of cells that cover the leaves, and the last known steps of the biosynthetic pathway are expressed exclusively in idioblasts, a rare cell type of the leaf,\" says Chenxin Li.      The researchers measured the concentrations of several intermediates in the metabolic pathway for vinblastine in single cells and were surprised. \"Two important precursors of vinblastine, catharanthine and vindoline, occur in the idioblast cells at millimolar concentrations, about three orders of magnitude higher than vinblastine itself. The concentration of the two precursors in these cells was much higher than we expected and even exceeded their concentrations in whole organ extracts. However, this observation makes sense in that catharanthine and vindoline were found only in the rare idioblast cells. The abundant other cells in the leaf dilute the high concentration when whole leaves are crushed,\" says Sarah O'Connor, head of the Department of Natural Product Biosynthesis.The research team is confident that the organization of biosynthetic pathways for medicinally relevant alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus is not an isolated phenomenon. \"We are just beginning to understand how and why such a cell type-specific organization exists. In addition, analysis of genes expressed simultaneously in a particular cell type has helped us identify new players in this metabolic pathway. The same technique can be used to study the biosynthesis of many other natural products.\"Finally, the exact sites of accumulation of plant compounds, such as the epidermis, the vascular system, or latex duct, can help us hypothesize the ecological roles of natural products. For example, depending on the pattern of accumulation, the compounds may be more effective against biting insects than they are against sap-sucking insects,\" says Robin Buell, Professor at Georgia University.A better understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of the anti-cancer drugs vincristine and vinblastine may also help to produce or harvest these compounds more effectively in the long term. The use of methods described is also promising for the study of many other interesting and medically important natural products from the plant kingdom. The approach described here will help to narrow down these rare and specialized cells and uncover the gene activities and chemistry that are exclusive to them.

  "text": "Researchers from Stockholm University have developed porous crystals made from pomegranate extract to capture and degrade pharmaceutical molecules found in local municipal wastewater. The research is published in the scientific journal Nature Water.          Pharmaceutical compounds affect the human body to improve our health, but they can also have unintentional adverse effects for the well-being of wildlife. Hence wastewater treatment plants are facing the challenge of removing emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) such as active pharmaceutical ingredients, and therefore new materials and technologies are required.One strategy for removing pollutants from water is by using porous materials that behave like sponges. Metal-organic frameworks, so called MOFs, are a type of nanoporous material that are made of metal ions and organic molecules. Most MOFs are made using synthetic organic molecules. But now researchers from the Department of Materials and Environmental Chemistry, Stockholm University, have managed to develop new porous MOFs using a naturally occurring molecule found in plants\u2014ellagic acid.\"Ellagic acid is one of the main building units of naturally occurring polyphenols known as tannins, which are common in fruits, berries, nuts, and tree bark. By combining ellagic acid, which was extracted from either pomegranate peel or tree bark, with zirconium ions, we developed a new highly porous MOF which we named SU-102,\" says Erik Svensson Grape, Ph.D. student at the Department of Materials and Environmental Chemistry.

The results showed that SU-102 removed many of the pharmaceutical pollutants that were not fully removed by the wastewater treatment facility. In addition to capturing the pharmaceutical pollutants, SU-102 was also used to break down pollutants using light in a process known as photodegradation.\"This has been a very exciting project as we got the opportunity to work directly with water samples from the treatment plant, thereby finding an application where our material could be put to use towards a very pressing environmental issue.

  "text": "Quick assessment of trace blood components in untreated blood samples is possible with fluorescence tests but, in practice, blood's strong autofluorescence interferes with the analysis. In the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition, a research team has now introduced a novel fluorescence probe that quenches this autofluorescence and precisely quantifies traces of hydrogen sulfide, which is an important signal molecule.          Some blood components are present in extremely low concentrations but are anything but unimportant. For example, the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide H2S, which smells of rotten eggs, is an important messenger molecule in the body. It is, among other things, involved in regulating circulation.Patients with cardiovascular diseases usually have a reduced H2S concentration in their blood, whereas patients with colon cancer often have elevated levels. The quantification of this and other trace components are correspondingly helpful in forming a diagnosis, and for the investigation of physiological and pathological relationships.Fluorescence tests are especially powerful in the analysis of biomolecules. They are inexpensive, uncomplicated, highly sensitive, and can be used for real-time measurements. The problem is that trace components cannot be detected in whole blood samples because blood itself strongly fluoresces, overwhelming weaker signals. Whole blood is therefore centrifuged and only the plasma is analyzed. However, this reduces the concentrations of unstable components and gas molecules, yielding inaccurate results.A team led by Hongwen Liu and Ronghua Yang at Hunan Normal University (Changsha, China) has now developed a novel technique for fluorescence tests that can successfully quantify H2S in whole blood. The trick is that the fluorescence probe itself almost completely quenches the interfering autofluorescence of the blood. The fluorescence dye very strongly absorbs the light that is given off by the autofluorescence of blood components.The fluorescence dye used is based on borodipyrromethene (BODIPY) that has been modified by the addition of two molecular fragments that \"recognize\" H2S. The presence of H2S activates the probe and it begins to fluoresce. Because the autofluorescence of the blood remains quenched, the background fluorescence remains very low and does not interfere.Fluorescence tests using the new probe on whole blood samples from patients with cardiovascular diseases verified their reduced H2S levels. Tests on mice with colon cancer showed, also as expected, elevated blood H2S concentrations.In addition, red blood cells from mice were treated with allicin. Allicin is the fragrant compound in garlic that is also responsible for its positive medicinal effects, such as reducing blood pressure. The team was able to use their new probe to demonstrate that allicin triggers the formation of H2S in red blood cells.The researchers hope to use this strategy to develop additional probes for other trace analytes in whole blood.

  "answer_squad": " sustainable electrochemical technique",
  "text": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major greenhouse gas emitted through various types of human activities. In an effort to decrease humanity's carbon footprint, scientists and policymakers across the globe are continuously trying to explore new methods for reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions and converting them into useful forms. In this regard, the electrochemical method of reducing CO2 to other carbonaceous forms like carbon monoxide, alcohols and hydrocarbon has gained considerable attention.          Against this backdrop, environmental researchers from Doshisha University, Japan led by Prof. Takuya Goto recently published a study in Electrochimica Acta that demonstrated one such method for converting CO2 into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) using molten salts through sustainable electrochemistry. Their study was made available online, and included contributions from Dr. Yuta Suzuki from the Harris Science Research Institute and Mr. Tsubasa Takeda from the Department of Science of Environment and Mathematical Modeling.Using a sustainable electrochemical technique, the research team facilitated the conversion of CO2 into MWCNT using LiCl-KCl melt. The molten salts were saturated with CO2 gas and semi-immersed nickel (Ni) substrate was used as electrode. The supplied CO2 was electrochemically converted to solid carbon at the end of the procedure. This green conversion occurred via a reduction reaction at the Ni electrode/LiCl-KCl melt/CO2 interface.\"The electrochemical reduction of CO2 on a Ni electrode in LiCl-KCl melt at 723K was studied. Under high polarization, a super meniscus was formed at the three-phase interface of the Ni electrode/LiCl-KCl melt/CO2 gas, where the direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 to solid carbon progressed. Solid carbon was obtained in the wetted area of the Ni electrode as well as in the bulk molten salt via the electrochemical technique,\" says Prof. Goto.Subsequent characterization of the electrode-deposited carbon using electron microscopy techniques and elemental analysis revealed that the obtained carbonaceous material consisted of MWCNTs, commercially viable nanostructures, that were 30\u201350 nm in diameter. The team then varied the applied voltage and extended the reaction time, recording noticeable changes in the MWCNTs. The height of the generated MWCNTs increased after the electrolysis time was increased from 10 min to 180 min.\"We studied the dependence of applied potential and electrolytic time on the morphology and crystallinity of the electrodeposited carbon. Based on our experimental results, we proposed a model for the formation of the MWCNTs on the Ni electrode,\" says Prof. Goto.The proposed model for the generation of MWCNTs from CO2 is described in three stages. The first stage involves the reduction of CO2 to carbon atoms at the Ni/LiCl-KCl melt/CO2 interface. During the second stage, the electrodeposited carbon atoms form Ni-C compounds (like NiC) on the surface of Ni electrode. Finally, when solubility limit of carbon in Ni-C compounds is reached, the cylindrical-shaped MWCNTs grow from the edge of the Ni-C compounds generated during the second stage.In summary, the study identifies a novel process for sustainably converting CO2 into commercially useful carbonaceous materials. Moreover, the employed electrochemical process is environment friendly owing to the non-usage of fossil fuel. In addition, the use of high-temperature molten salts is unique because it enables the direct conversion of CO2 gas into MWCNTs.\"Our results indicate that CO2 can be converted into carbonaceous functional materials. By combining non-consumable oxygen-evolving anodes, this technique can contribute to the development of a carbon recycling technology that will not only solve global environmental problems but also play an important in carbon pricing economies.

  "text": "Synthetic organic polymers are typically insoluble polycrystalline or amorphous products rather than single crystals. The direct synthesis of single-crystal porous polymers remains a challenge in polymer science and crystal engineering.          However, many biomacromolecules found in nature can achieve single-crystal form assisted with multiple supramolecular interactions, implying that reversible supramolecular interactions can be used to modulate the crystallinity of porous polymer materials.In a study published in Nature Synthesis, the research groups led by Prof. Liu Tianfu and Prof. Cao Rong from Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter of the Chinese Academy of Sciences proposed a strategy to achieve single crystals of a porous polymer.In the hierarchical structures of natural protein crystals and some nucleic acids, 1D covalent chains generate highly crystalline or even single-crystal products through a synergistic combination of non-covalent supramolecular interactions, and further fold into specific spatial conformations as secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. Inspired by this, the researchers envisioned that the judicious choice of 1D chains with tunable dynamic covalent bonds and supramolecular interactions might yield direct synthesis of a single-crystal porous polymer with desired cavities, ion channels and functionalities.They designed and synthesized a single-crystal porous polymer-based hydrogen-bonded organic framework (PHOF-1) through a one-pot route and confirmed its structure by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies.The researchers found that 1,4-phenylenebisboronic acid monomers polymerize into a tetramer to afford a nine-membered B4O52- cluster (primary structure), which further extends into 1D covalent chains (secondary structure) that are non\u2013covalently cross-linked by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions (tertiary structure), ultimately evolving to afford a hydrogen-bonded organic framework (quaternary structure).Compared with insoluble 2D or 3D crosslinked porous polymers, the 1D polymer chains show excellent solubility and solution processability. The dissolved PHOF-1 maintains the consecutive 1D chain structure with a very narrow molecular weight distribution and can regenerate reversibly in single-crystal or amorphous states depending on the solvent evaporation rate.Taking advantage of the solution processibility, the researchers continuously coated PHOF-1 onto a non-woven fabric to afford a functional composite textile capable of capturing NH3.This design strategy may open a new avenue for the exploration of single-crystal porous polymer materials with precise structural information, confined pore spaces, and straightforward solution processibility.

  "text": "During his Ph.D. with TUoS, ISIS facility development student Innes McClelland developed a cell for testing battery materials during their operation using muon spectroscopy and used it to study an increasingly vital cathode material.          Understanding what is happening inside a battery material while it is charging and discharging is crucial to improving the performance of existing batteries and developing new materials for use in the batteries of the future.One cathode material that is proving increasingly vital for future batteries is LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2, known as NMC811. This material has a high capacity, but often suffers an irreversible capacity loss between the first charge and discharge. It's thought that this loss of capacity may be due to kinetic barriers to diffusion of the lithium ions in the material. Understanding this issue could lead to insights that inform the design of new and improved alternatives.Muon spectroscopy is an excellent tool for studying these materials because it can probe the diffusion of ions such as lithium and sodium on a local scale, largely avoiding interfacial or grain boundary effects. Previous muon experiments on battery materials have studied the components individually, outside a battery. Although these are useful for understanding the fundamental properties, they lack an insight into the behavior of the materials during operation.Professor Serena Cussen, who co-supervised Innes through his PhD, spoke as part of an ISIS-organized session at the AAAS conference in March. In this video, she gives an overview of the work of her research group, and how they use neutrons and muons to learn more about materials of interest for clean energy storage research. Credit: University of SheffieldAs part of his ISIS facility development studentship, Dr. Innes McClelland designed a cell that would be able to do just that. Working in collaboration with his co-supervisor beamline scientist Peter Baker and engineers from ISIS, his supervisor Professor Serena Cussen at the University of Sheffield and colleagues from the Faraday Institution next-generation cathode project FutureCat, he was able to design a cell for doing operando muon spectroscopy measurements.As explained in their recent paper, published in Chemistry of Materials, the group were able to use this cell to study NMC811 to investigate what might be causing its lack of repeat cyclability. Using the new setup, they could measure the lithium diffusion characteristics within the material at over 70 points during the first cycle. They found that the lithium diffusion was, as expected, faster at a higher state of charge, but that it never restored to the same value as in the pristine sample.Interestingly, by combining the differing measurement properties of muon spectroscopy with electrochemical methods, they were able to see that this slow diffusion was more prevalent on the surface of the cathode, rather than in the bulk material. This suggests that processes that focus on stabilizing the surface of the material are likely to be more successful at improving its properties.\"The exciting development of operando muon spectroscopy opens up a wide range of opportunities for researchers working on energy storage materials, allowing a unique perspective of ionic diffusion from inside the materials themselves whilst in operation,\" Innes explains.He adds, \"I look forward to seeing future studies which can develop the field towards a variety of battery chemistries.\" More information:Innes McClelland et al, Direct Observation of Dynamic Lithium Diffusion Behavior in Nickel-Rich, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) Cathodes Using Operando Muon Spectroscopy, Chemistry of Materials (2023).

  "answer_squad": " polyester hydrolases",
  "text": "The rigidity, transparency and hardness of PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) make it one of the most valuable plastics for the manufacture of plastic bottles, packaging and other single-use products. However, these characteristics make it highly persistent in the environment, to the point that a plastic PET bottle may take several hundred years to degrade in the ocean.          At the molecular level, PET, and all plastics, have a polymeric structure made up of tens of thousands of repetitions of small subunits called monomers. In the last decades, the degradation of PET by a kind of bacterial enzymes called polyester hydrolases (or PETases) has been regarded with much hope, as it is considered as a potential eco-friendly method for recycling plastic waste and recover the original monomers, thus enabling an effective circular-material economy loop.Now, a new study led by the Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies del Mar (ICM-CSIC) and the University of Leipzig (Germany) has revealed the details, at the molecular level, of the PET degradation process by these enzymes.\"The results of our work can be very useful for the industry, as this is the first time we can 'see' the motion picture of the process. Also, they pave the way to design new enzymes capable of breaking down the plastic into its original soluble components with high efficiency,\" explains Francesco Colizzi, a leading author of the study.From her side, Ania Di Pede-Mattatelli, one of the work co-authors, adds that \"these enzymes could also be applied to treat PET microplastics from washing of microfleece textiles that end up in sewage treatment plants, thus contributing to the preservation of the marine environment.\"Experiments and 3D simulationsTo unravel the inherent mechanism of biocatalytic degradation of PET at the atomic level, the authors of the work, recently published in the journal ACS Catalysis, designed a glass matrix that stabilized the enzymatic reaction intermediates and allowed their detection in real time by specific experiments of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Then, using molecular calculations on a supercomputer, they were able to interpret the spectroscopic data and generate a detailed 3D molecular model of the enzymatic process of PET degradation.Until now, how PET could bind and interact with these enzymes have been the subject of intense research, and controversial hypotheses have been put forward. For example, the simultaneous binding of a large portion of PET to the enzyme was thought to be necessary for the enzyme to break down the plastic polymer into its original components.Instead, this work shows that the interaction of only 2 PET subunits is enough for the enzyme to cut the polymer. Lastly, the study reveals that the enzyme can \"walk\" or slide on the PET chain to move from one cut to the other.\"Understanding how PET interacts with the enzyme is important to guide the design of new improved systems for recycling. In the end, nature itself provides us with the starting material to reduce plastic pollution, but we must use them appropriately,\" concludes Colizzi.

  "text": "New synthetic metabolic pathways for fixation of carbon dioxide could not only help to reduce the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, but also replace conventional chemical manufacturing processes for pharmaceuticals and active ingredients with carbon-neutral, biological processes. A new study published in Nature Communications demonstrates a process that can turn carbon dioxide into a valuable material for the biochemical industry via formic acid.          In view of rising greenhouse gas emissions, carbon capture, the sequestration of carbon dioxide from large emission sources, is an urgent issue. In nature, carbon dioxide assimilation has been taking place for millions of years, but its capacity is far from sufficient to compensate man-made emissions.Researchers led by Tobias Erb at the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology are using nature's toolbox to develop new ways of carbon dioxide fixation. They have now succeeded in developing an artificial metabolic pathway that produces the highly reactive formaldehyde from formic acid, a possible intermediate product of artificial photosynthesis. Formaldehyde could be fed directly into several metabolic pathways to form other valuable substances without any toxic effects. As in the natural process, two primary components are required: Energy and carbon. The former can be provided not only by direct sunlight but also by electricity\u2014for example from solar modules.Formic acid is a C1 building blockWithin the added-value chain, the carbon source is variable. carbon dioxide is not the only option here, all monocarbons (C1 building blocks) come into question: carbon monoxide, formic acid, formaldehyde, methanol and methane. However, almost all of these substances are highly toxic\u2014either to living organisms (carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol) or to the planet (methane as a greenhouse gas). Only formic acid, when neutralized to its base formate, is tolerated by many microorganisms in high concentrations.\"Formic acid is a very promising carbon source,\" says Maren Nattermann, first author of the study. \"But converting it to formaldehyde in the test tube is quite energy-intensive.\" This is because the salt of formic acid, formate, cannot be converted easily into formaldehyde. \"There's a serious chemical barrier between the two molecules that we have to bridge with biochemical energy\u2014ATP\u2014before we can perform the actual reaction.\"The researcher's goal was to find a more economical way. After all, the less energy it takes to feed carbon into metabolism, the more energy remains to drive growth or production. But such a path does not exist in nature. \"It takes some creativity to discover so-called promiscuous enzymes with multiple functions,\" says Tobias Erb. \"However, the discovery of candidate enzymes is only the beginning. We're talking about reactions that you can count along with since they're so slow\u2014in some cases, less than one reaction per second per enzyme. Natural reactions can happen a thousand times faster.\"This is where synthetic biochemistry comes in, says Maren Nattermann. \"If you know an enzyme's structure and mechanism, you know where to intervene. Here, we benefit significantly from the preliminary work of our colleagues in basic research.\"      High-throughput technology speeds up enzyme optimizationThe optimization of the enzymes included several approaches: building blocks were specifically exchanged, and random mutations were generated and selected for capability. \"Formate and formaldehyde are both wonderfully suited because they penetrate cell walls. We can put formate into the culture medium of cells that produce our enzymes, and after a few hours convert the formaldehyde produced into a non-toxic yellow dye,\" explains Maren Nattermann.The result would not have been possible in such a short time without the use of high-throughput methods. To achieve this, the researchers cooperated with their industrial partner Festo, based in Esslingen, Germany. \"After about 4,000 variants, we achieved a fourfold improvement in production,\" says Maren Nattermann. \"We have thus created the basis for the model mikrobe Escherichia coli, the microbial workhorse of biotechnology, to grow on formic acid. For now, however, our cells can only produce formaldehyde, not convert it further.\"With collaboration partner Sebastian Wenk at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, the researchers are currently developing a strain that can take up the intermediates and introduce them into the central metabolism. In parallel, the team is conducting research with a working group at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion headed by Walter Leitner on the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to formic acid. The long-term goal is an \"all-in-one platform\"\u2014from carbon dioxide via an electrobiochemical process to products like insulin or biodiesel.

  "text": "Plastic is cheap and light, and conceivably recyclable, which makes it an easy choice for packaging when it comes to food and cosmetics. But it's also potentially toxic and biologically harmful, making it a non-starter for many environmentally responsible and socially conscious companies in Canada and around the world.          Western chemistry professor Elizabeth Gillies, mechanical and materials engineering professor Aaron Price and their research teams worked with industry partner CTK Bio Canada to develop a new biodegradable, hemp-based material that could serve as a sustainable substitute for packaging needs for a wide variety of products.\"When it comes to packaging, plastic replaces things like metal and glass. Those are heavy and expensive,\" said Gillies, who is also the Canada Research Chair in polymeric biomaterials. \"Glass recycling is not a very profitable business and while many plastics are potentially recyclable, it often doesn't happen in practice.\"This lack of recycling, compounded by a global microplastics pollution crisis, led Gillies and her team to find a degradable 'plastic' to solve the problem, or in this case, a hemp-based product.Hemp is a sustainable agricultural crop that requires minimal resources to grow. It's also a waste product of Canada's ever-growing cannabis industry, making it a free resource that would otherwise be destined for a compost heap or the landfill. These reasons alone make hemp a suitable candidate, but its structural makeup makes it a clear winner.\"Depending on the form, hemp can have a fibrous structure, which acts perfectly as a reinforcement for materials,\" said Gillies. \"Basically, hemp is stronger and more malleable than many other biomaterials.\"The goal of the project with CTK Bio was to find a proxy for widely used industrial plastics such as high-density polyethylene pellets, which could be fed directly into the same manufacturing process currently used to produce plastic packaging. Gillies and her collaborators used ground hemp stalk powder to serve as filler during production of packaging.While mechanical properties like strength and malleability are not quite the same as the current packaging plastics, the new biomaterial approaches the necessary qualities, depending on the application, and they do exhibit degradability, which is key.In terms of cost, biomaterials are currently more expensive to produce than plastic, but companies are working to optimize and reduce pricing, so it is expected costs will fall in the coming years as these technologies improve.Results of the study validate the new hemp-based biomaterial's potential as a plastic alternative and open the door for future industry collaborations and partnerships.

  "text": "An international research team led by Bert Weckhuysen (Utrecht University) and Sara Bals (University of Antwerp) has shown that a promising catalyst for clearing CO2 becomes significantly more active and selective if its pretreatment is modified. The scientists have visualized the mechanism underlying this concept with unparalleled precision. The results of the study are published in Science on May 11. Matteo Monai, Kellie Jenkinson and Angela Melcherts are the first authors.          Cleaning up carbon dioxide or converting it into something useful is becoming increasingly common, for example in the energy and transportation sectors, where huge amounts of the greenhouse gas are emitted. Catalysts are necessary for such a cleanup process to proceed properly and quickly. In the case of CO2 hydrogenation, which is a widely used chemical reaction to clean up CO2, a nickel-supported titanium dioxide catalyst is used.In this study, the scientists show that the catalyst's performance is highly dependent on the temperature at which it is prepared. The selectivity and activity of the catalyst were much better during CO2 hydrogenation at a pretreatment temperature of 600\u00b0C than at 400\u00b0C. Better selectivity is desirable because the catalyst provides fewer unwanted by-products. Improved activity results in a faster progression of the catalytic reaction. The researchers expect the same principle to apply to catalysts with metal oxides other than titanium oxide.The team of scientists made the principle visible using advanced electron microscopy. And they did so with unparalleled precision: at the atomic level. They inserted a special nanoreactor, in which the catalytic process took place, into the microscope and were able to see exactly what happened to the catalyst.\"During the process, you see the titanium atoms crawling onto the nickel like layers and coming off again,\" Bert Weckhuysen says. \"At a high pretreatment temperature, some titanium atoms remained on the nickel. At a low temperature, the layers of titanium atoms disappeared completely.\"Two chemical elements, such as nickel and titanium, interacting and forming a catalyst, is an old concept known as strong metal support interaction (SMSI). This study reveals for the first time what happens at the atomic level during this interaction. The sliding layers of titanium have never been seen before. \"The new technique has made it possible for us to observe this with our own eyes,\" says Weckhuysen. \"With, moreover, a very high resolution. We can count the titanium atoms on the nickel.\"The international research team that worked on the study is extremely interdisciplinary. According to Sara Bals, this was critical to achieving the results obtained. \"We used electron microscopy techniques that are generally difficult to combine with experiments in a nanoreactor,\" she says. \"Researchers with different backgrounds and access to a variety of advanced techniques each laid out small pieces of a larger puzzle.

  "text": "Scripps Research chemists have solved a long-standing problem in the field of pharmaceutical chemistry with a relatively simple and controllable method for making benzocyclobutenes (BCBs)\u2014a class of reactive compounds that are highly valued as building blocks for drug molecules, but have been relatively hard to access.          The new method, described in a paper in Science, uses designer ligand molecules with palladium-atom catalysts to break pairs of adjacent methylene-type C-H bonds in relatively cheap and abundant carboxylic acids. Breaking these bonds enables the making of BCBs with unprecedented ease through a process called a formal [2+2] cycloaddition.The researchers demonstrated the new method with relatively easy syntheses of several BCBs found in traditional medicines and in experimental and approved drug molecules. The paper, \"Regio-controllable [2+2] benzannulation with two adjacent C(sp3)\u2013H bonds,\" was co-authored by Ji-Min Yang, Yu-Kun Lin, Tao Sheng, Liang Hu, Xin-Pei Cai and Jin-Quan Yu, all of Scripps Research.\"Our new method requires only a saturated aliphatic chain and aryl halides as coupling partners for a formal cycloaddition yielding a four-membered ring,\" says study senior author Jin-Quan Yu, Ph.D., the Bristol Myers Squibb Endowed Chair in Chemistry and Frank and Bertha Hupp Professor in the Department of Chemistry at Scripps Research. \"By contrast, the traditional method for making BCBs requires more steps and yields a mix of products that are hard to separate.\"BCBs have a unique core structure consisting of a relatively rigid, strained and reactive ring of four carbon atoms fused to a benzene ring. They are present in some natural medicinal compounds and in the heart-failure drug ivabradine. In general, their propensity for biological activity makes them potentially very useful building blocks for drugs. They are also key ingredients in photosensitive polymers, polymer dielectrics and other advanced materials.The synthesis of BCBs has been challenging, however. The limitations of the various methods that have been published include an inability to control the order in which individual reactions occur, so that the reaction products include not only the desired product but also unwanted ones. Yu's new method for the first time enables this control\u2014a property called regioselectivity.Last year, the Yu lab developed a method for the palladium-catalyzed, \u03b2- and \u03b3-methylene C-H functionalization of free aliphatic acids, to make structurally diverse \u03b3- and \u03b4-lactones\u2014also highly valued as potential pharmaceutical building blocks. Inspired by that method and using it as a starting point, they pursued a similar approach to surmount the challenge of BCB regioselective synthesis.For the new method, they employed bidentate amide-pyridone ligands bearing palladium catalysts to activate the C-H bonds of two adjacent methylene units in a carboxylic acid.\"In the presence of a dihaloheteroarene, two C\u2013H bonds and two aryl\u2013halogen bonds are stitched together almost miraculously to form a bicyclic BCB scaffold,\" Yu says. \"Regioselectivity is achieved through the differentiation between the aryl iodide and bromide sites.\"The chemists showed that the method can be used with a wide range of cyclic and acyclic aliphatic acids to generate diverse BCBs and hetero-BCBs\u2014a dream come true for many pharmaceutical chemists.\"The ability to make direct use of abundant and structurally varied acyclic and cyclic acids as substrates, without pre-functionalization, substantially expands chemists' access to diverse BCB scaffolds\u2014including heterocyclic BCBs that can be very useful in drug molecules,\" Yu says.

  "text": "Smashed on toast, creamed in guacamole or blended into salad dressing, avocados always seem to be popular. However, the fruits are notoriously finicky, going from pale green and firm to brown and mushy in the blink of an eye. Now, researchers in ACS Food Science & Technology report a chitosan-based coating that preserves them for longer periods. The team also developed an imaging technique to quickly predict their shelf life.          To tell if avocados are ripe, most people gently squeeze them, and a little sponginess indicates that they're mature. Producers conduct similar assessments to determine which avocados can withstand transportation to grocery stores. Despite these tests, some of them spoil prematurely.Therefore, researchers have developed techniques to delay ripening, using compounds such as 1-methyl-cyclopropene (1-MCP). And more recently, studies have shown that naturally-derived chitosan\u2014a biomaterial derived from shellfish exoskeletons\u2014imparts antimicrobial activity when applied as a coating to fruits, including avocados. So, Angie Homez-Jara, Angelica Sandoval-Aldana and colleagues wanted to compare the effectiveness of the two preservation methods on avocados' quality and shelf life.The researchers treated commercially mature Hass avocados with either gaseous 1-MCP or water-based solutions that contained different concentrations of chitosan. Mimicking realistic transportation conditions, treated and untreated avocados were chilled at 41 degrees Fahrenheit for 21 days and then moved to room temperature to simulate a grocery store environment, until they were rotten.Untreated samples and those treated with either 1-MCP or 1% chitosan-based coating were at optimal ripeness for 6 days. Fruits treated with a 1.5% chitosan-based coating were best for 12 days. However, these samples also had uneven firmness once they were ripe, as well as green and purplish spots in the peel, which the researchers say shows that the chitosan coating could be improved in the future.Throughout the study, the researchers also imaged the entire surface of the fruits with hyperspectral cameras in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. Then the reflectance data from the images were compared to the avocados' firmness, peel color, oxygen consumption and weight loss, using a number of computer models.Two machine learning models best explained the changes that occurred during the avocados' ripening and could predict their remaining shelf life. The researchers say that their chitosan-based coating and prediction technique could help improve the shelf life and quality of avocados for sale.

Now, Lena Daumann from Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Germany, and her international interdisciplinary team have discovered that some actinides can replace essential lanthanides in the metabolism of methylotrophic bacteria.Methylotrophic bacteria, so-called as they use methanol as their energy source, contain lanthanides in their methanol-oxidizing enzyme. The researchers observed that these bacteria could also take up actinide ions into this enzyme, using them for methanol metabolism in the same way as they would use lanthanides. This observation was particularly valid when the actinide ions were the same size and had the same stable +III oxidation states as the corresponding lanthanides. The bacteria even preferred americium and curium as actinides over some lanthanides when presented with a mixture of lanthanides and actinides, the researchers reported.Americium and curium showed a stable +III oxidation state, which appeared to be particularly important. \"When we used plutonium, which is known to have higher oxidation states, our bacteria did not grow, nor did the isolated enzymes work with it either,\" Daumann says. This knowledge will be useful for future applications. The team plans to explore the ability of the bacteria to extract actinides from radioactive waste or to separate out specific elements from mixtures.Actinides such as plutonium, americium, and curium can be generated in nuclear reactors and are used in research, the nuclear industry, and many other technologies. Americium is even a source of ionizing radiation in commercial smoke detectors. However, actinides are highly radioactive and hazardous elements, which have to be handled with great care at special facilities. Spillages of radioactive substances are always of great concern. Dauman proposes \"putting these bacteria to use to help clean up radioactive spills,\" as a possible future application.

  "answer_squad": " methane",
  "text": "Extensive research has been conducted on the oxidation of methane to obtain methanol for the production of useful compounds, such as formaldehyde, dimethyl ether, etc. However, methane is the most difficult hydrocarbon to be oxidized, and to date, to the best of our knowledge, no method has been developed to efficiently and selectively convert methane to methanol under mild conditions.       Inspired by the structure and reaction mechanism of naturally occurring metalloenzymes that oxidize methane, researchers have developed a mononuclear iron complex with a hydrophobic environment near the active iron center. Using this iron complex as a catalyst and a cheap and safe oxidant, they have accomplished the direct conversion of methane to methanol with high efficiency and selectivity.In this reaction, the oxidation of methane proceeds under mild conditions of 50 \u00b0C temperature and ~10 atm pressure in an aqueous solution. The catalytic turnover number exceeds 500 in 3 h and methanol can be produced with a high selectivity of 83%.The achievement of such high efficiency and selectivity is owing to the presence of a hydrophobic environment near the iron center, i.e., the active site of the catalyst. The hydrophobic cavity traps methane (hydrophobic substance) and releases the generated methanol (hydrophilic substance) into the aqueous solution while preventing the excessive oxidation of methanol by suppressing its approach to the active iron center.Such a \"catch-and-release\" mechanism is expected to be an effective model that can be applied to the conversion of methane to methanol as well as to the efficient chemical conversion of various hydrophobic organic compounds.The study is published in the journal Nature.

  "text": "A common chemical reaction that most people have seen first-hand is the inspiration for a new way to make a flexible gel film that could lead to innovations in sensors, batteries, robotics and more.          A research team led by Texas Engineers developed what they call a \"dip-and-peel\" strategy for simple and rapid fabrication of two-dimensional ionogel membranes. By dipping sustainable biomass materials in certain solvents, molecules naturally respond by arranging themselves into functional thin films at the edge of the material that can easily be removed using nothing more than a simple set of tweezers.This strategy, the researchers said, was inspired by what happens to milk at elevated temperatures\u2014a reaction we often observe in daily life.\"In the milk-skin effect, a film forms at the outer layer of milk when it is heated,\" said Guihua Yu, a professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering's Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering and Texas Materials Institute, who focuses on materials science. \"We were inspired by this phenomena and explored it in different materials to produce multifunctional gel membranes that are easy to separate.\"The research was published in Nature Synthesis.                Credit: The University of Texas at Austin/Cockrell School of Engineering             These gels are made up of a polymer network surrounded by ionic liquid. They are similar to hydrogels in structure, where water is the liquid element. But, ionogels feature a less rigid structure, giving ions more room to move around.Because of this, they are highly conductive and very sensitive. They have high potential as sensors, possibly as part of wearable electronics that could more accurately track motion, heartbeat and other aspects of health monitoring. They could even serve as the electrolyte in solid-state batteries, a part of the safer battery that shuttles ions back and forth to facilitate charging and discharging.The major innovation in the research is in the novel fabrication process, and it works on many different materials. The process can be reproduced hundreds or thousands of times at high speed and low cost. And the films can be easily manipulated to be as thick or thin as needed and shaped or coated to other materials.\"This simple yet effective solvent-induced self-assembly method really allows rapid, and scalable production of 2D functional polymer films from different sustainable biomass materials, including cellulose, chitosan, silk fibroin, guar gum and more,\" said Nancy (Youhong) Guo, one of the lead authors on the paper, a former graduate student in Yu's lab and now a postdoctoral researcher at MIT.Yu said he hopes other researchers will pick up this technique and run with it for various technologies. Going forward, the research team will work to further optimize the mechanical properties for more applications and advanced functionalities for next-generation technologies such as wearable electronics, smart robotics and artificial intelligence.This research also involves other collaborators from Northeast Forestry University and Shenyang University of Chemical Technology in China.

  "text": "Much of what is now considered modern medicine originated as folk remedies or traditional, Indigenous practices. These customs are still alive today, and they could help address a variety of conditions. Now reporting in ACS Omega, a team of researchers have identified compounds in the leaves of a particular medicinal Labrador tea plant used throughout the First Nations of Nunavik, Canada, and demonstrated that one of them has activity against the parasite responsible for malaria.          \"Labrador tea\" refers to multiple, closely related plants\u2014all members of the genus Rhododendron. These are small, evergreen shrubs with fuzzy leaves that, as their name suggests, are steeped to make herbal teas commonly used by the Inuit and Indigenous nations in the U.S. and Canada. Reportedly, drinks made from the leaves or roots can aid in treating colds or the flu, headaches or stomach aches, nasal congestion and many other ailments.Past studies have shown that essential oils extracted from the plants have antimicrobial properties, which could help fight antibiotic-resistant microbes. Dwarf Labrador tea, or Rhododendron subarcticum, produces a particularly aromatic brew and grows in the harsher conditions of the subarctic, found from Alaska to Siberia just south of the Arctic Circle.Despite its common use as a traditional medicine, its chemical composition and potential antimicrobial applications remain relatively unstudied. So, Normand Voyer and colleagues wanted to characterize the makeup of R. subarcticum for the first time and test its antiparasitic activity.The team gathered R. subarcticum leaves from Nunavik, a region in northern Quebec. The researchers extracted the essential oil from the leaves and analyzed it with gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and flame ionization detection, to identify 53 compounds. It turns out that 64.7% of the oil was comprised of ascaridole, followed by p-cymene at 21.1%. This combination of compounds has not previously been reported in closely related North American Labrador tea varieties, though it has been found in subspecies originating in Europe and Asia.To see whether this essential oil had antimalarial properties, the team exposed two strains of Plasmodium falciparum, a malaria-causing parasite, to the oil or to just ascaridole. In the experiment, one of the strains was resistant to known antimalaria drugs. The data showed that ascaridole was the primarily component that acted against both strains of the parasite, which is consistent with other, antiparasitic traditional medicines also rich in the compound.The researchers say that this work bolsters the importance of investigating and protecting plants used in traditional medicines, especially those from harsher climates impacted by climate change.

  "text": "How did catalytic organic polymers emerge on prebiotic Earth? Answering this essential question will unlock key understandings in the origin of life.          A team of scientists at Tohoku University have recently found a potential environment for the reaction that produced catalytic organic polymers. To do so, they dried amino acid solutions containing boric acid and found that boric acid catalyzes polypeptide synthesis under neutral and acidic conditions. The longest peptides formed in the experiments were 39 monomer-long glycine polypeptides under a neutral condition.Details of their research were published in the journal Communications Chemistry on May 11, 2023.Previous studies have suggested that highly alkaline evaporative environments served as the place for ancient protein synthesis, yielding up to 20 monomer-long glycine peptides. Neutral conditions were thought to be the worst-case in regards to peptide synthesis.Boron-containing minerals have been discovered abundantly in some of the oldest sedimentary-origin rocks found on Earth, dating back 3.8 billion years. These findings suggest that coastal areas of ancient small continents and islands rich in boric acid spontaneously assembled amino acids, forming polypeptides and proto-proteins.\"The formation of polypeptides in neutral environments have important meanings in the chemical evolution of the origin of life,\" says lead author Yoshihiro Furukawa, an associate professor at Tohoku University.While RNAs are rather stable under neutral conditions, they are extremely unstable under alkaline conditions. Boron has been known to help many steps in abiotic ribonucleotide synthesis.\"Boron-rich neutral evaporative environments serve as an ideal place for the formations and interactions between the two essential polymers on prebiotic Earth,\" Furukawa says.This research group is now investigating which amino acids are incorporated in the proto-peptides in this environment.

The study was published in Separation and Purification Technology on May 4.       The researchers found that the substrate was completely covered with floriform microstructure film. They introduced OH-/I substitution strategy to fabricate iodine-defects engineering BiOI film. The superficial color of the 3D-printed substrates ordinally changed from gloss white to brownish yellow, dark yellow, and light yellow, which was ascribed to the change of band gap caused by iodine-defect engineering film.During the growing process of films, iodine spaces were introduced into the BiOI crystals, increasing BiOI internal electric field and electron density and improving photoinduced carrier separation and transmission efficiency. Iodine-defects engineering BiOI exhibited smaller grain size, higher specific surface area, electronegativity, photoelectric response and photocatalytic activity than stoichiometry BiOI.

  "text": "Spring means snowstorms for much of the country, which can bring inches of heavy, wet snow. Tree branches sag, and a few snap\u2014but most bounce back quickly with the warming spring sun.          Plant cells contain high amounts of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, which are the primary building blocks of plant stems and trunks. Much less is known, however, about a crucial fourth polymer: pectin, thought to provide strength and flexibility by interconnecting with the other three components.What has particularly puzzled scientists is exactly how plants build the pectin components of the cell wall.Now, researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the University of Georgia, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have discovered the biological mechanism involved in making one specific component of pectin. Published in Nature Plants, the article details the structure and biochemical activity of the enzyme Galactan Synthase 1 (GalS1), an enzyme involved in turning the sugar galactose into its polymeric form, called galactan\u2014an important pectin component.\"If you ask most people in the biofuels industry about the major components of plant cell walls, they will tell you cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin,\" said Yannick Bomble, an NREL biophysicist. \"Pectin is often overlooked unless you talk to a plant scientist, but it's a very essential component of any plant.\"The study complements the team's other recent work that details different processes in plant biopolymer synthesis. Together, they provide a picture on how plant enzymes work together to build complex polymers\u2014polymers that scientists might someday modify to more easily extract useful cell wall components from biomass or manufacture sustainable bioproducts.GalS1 decorates pectin with sidechains of arabinose and galactose sugarsTo create flexible limbs, deep roots, and sturdy trunks, plant enzymes work in tandem to reconfigure raw resources like sugars into polymers they can later use as building materials for their cell walls. Among the many enzymes involved in these processes, GalS1 performs a specific role: It links galactose sugar molecules together onto a long pectin chain at specific locations, almost like fastening tree branches to a central trunk.The result is a structurally complex molecular component of pectin. According to Vivek Bharadwaj, an NREL computational scientist, researchers have struggled to understand plant enzymes, such as GalS1, involved in making polymers like pectin.\"We wanted to understand, at the atomistic level, how the substrates bind at the active site and the mechanisms by which the sugar gets attached to increase the chain length of the galactan branch,\" he said. \"That's really traditionally been tough to do experimentally, which is where NREL came in.\"Using computational tools, Bharadwaj and Bomble provided an unprecedentedly detailed look at both the structure of the enzyme and its biochemistry. That effort revealed specifics on how and where the substrates bind, as well as what biological machinery GalS1 uses to complete such specific biochemical tasks.They found that GalS1 is unique, containing a special module that lets it bind to a pectin backbone laid down by other enzymes. Once attached, GalS1 positions its catalytic domain to start stacking sugars, one on top of another. The resulting branches\u2014comprised of galactan chains that are terminated with arabinose\u2014provide unique structure and function to the resulting pectin. Large quantities of galactose are observed in tension wood, for example\u2014a form of wood especially adept at weathering the elements.      Could bendy trees make better biofuels?So why all that trouble to understand a single enzyme with a very specific role? According to Bomble, the long-term goal is being able to tweak the concentrations of sugars in plant cell walls generally and in pectin and hemicelluloses more precisely.\"We want to be able to control the ratio of all the different components to give lignocellulosic materials the properties that we want,\" Bomble explained.Overexpressing or modifying enzymes like GalS1 could influence the properties of cell walls, changing the chemical composition of pectin and other key polymers. For example, GalS1 might be one of the enzymes involved in imparting extra flexibility in key areas of a plant, such as in tree limbs susceptible to a spring snowstorm.Bomble said that scientists in the future might be able to modify GalS1 to add even more galactose, or even glucose, favored in processes for making biofuels.\"Microbes usually have an easier time converting C6 sugars, like galactose, than C5 sugars, like arabinose,\" he said. \"It would be better to have higher concentrations of C6 sugars in the plant cell wall to upgrade them into useful products.\"Of course, Bomble and Bharadwaj caution that effectively modifying enzymes will require many more focused, peer-reviewed scientific studies. As Bharadwaj said, \"What will happen to the strength of these plant cell walls when you shift that C5 to C6 ratio? We don't know enough about it.\"For now, next time you see branches rocking in the wind or flexing under the snow, think about GalS1 and the numerous other enzymes needed to achieve the feat. Those same enzymes could hold the keys to more efficient, cost-effective routes to sustainable biofuels and bioproducts.

  "text": "A new method for analyzing protein crystals\u2014developed by Cornell University researchers and given a funky two-part name\u2014could open up applications for new drug discovery and other areas of biotechnology and biochemistry.          The development, outlined in a paper published March 3 in Nature Communications, provides researchers with the tools to interpret the once-discarded data from X-ray crystallography experiments\u2014an essential method used to study the structures of proteins. This work, which builds on a study released in 2020, could lead to a better understanding of a protein's movement, structure and overall function.Protein crystallography produces bright spots, known as Bragg peaks, from the crystals, providing high-resolution information about the shape and structure of a protein. This process also captures blurry images\u2014patterns and clouds related to the movement and vibrations of the proteins\u2014hidden in the background of the Bragg peaks.These background images are typically discarded, with priority given to the bright Bragg peak imagery that is more easily analyzed.\"We know that this pattern is related to the motion of the atoms of the protein, but we haven't been able to use that information,\" said lead author Steve Meisburger, a former postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Nozomi Ando, associate professor of chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences. \"The information is there, but we didn't know how to use it. Now we do.\"Meisburger worked closely with Ando to develop the robust workflow to decode the weak background signals from crystallography experiments called diffuse scattering. This allows researchers to analyze the total scattering from crystals, which depends on both the protein's structure and the subtle blur of its movements.Their two-part method\u2014which the team dubbed GOODVIBES and DISCOBALL\u2014simultaneously provides a high-resolution structure of the protein and information on its correlated atomic movements.GOODVIBES analyzes the X-ray data by separating the movements\u2014subtle vibrations\u2014of the protein from other proteins that might be moving around it. DISCOBALL independently validates these movements for certain proteins directly from the data, allowing researchers to trust the results from GOODVIBES and understand what the protein might be doing.Ando said that while the potential for using diffuse scattering has been recognized for a long time, the act of accurately measuring the subtle signal while processing the data for something useful has been very difficult to do.\"It is much more computationally intensive to analyze than trying to analyze crystallography data alone,\" Ando said. \"We have a lot more data to deal with in diffuse scattering, because we are looking everywhere all at once, and the signal is also very nuanced.\"The overarching goal, Ando said, is to turn GOODVIBES and DISCOBALL into a genuine structural technique that can be used by researchers at synchrotrons all over the world.\"There is a lot of interest within the structural biology and biochemistry fields to use this signal,\" Ando said. \"We weren't satisfied with just understanding what's contained in the signal; it was really important for us to make the next step of creating the tools, and making GOODVIBES and DISCOBALL available for others to use these tools and test their hypotheses.\"These methods were developed using lysozyme proteins collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS); the Ando group will be returning to CHESS this spring to collaborate with Meisburger, now a CHESS staff scientist, on more complex protein structures using their new method.By isolating the internal motion signals from total scattering data of these complex proteins, researchers can learn more about how proteins move and interact with other important molecules. This information can be used to design new drugs and therapies that target specific proteins. More information:Steve P.

  "text": "A team of researchers, jointly led by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, have discovered that a solar cell material\u2014bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI)\u2014is capable of detecting X-ray dose rates over 250 times lower than the current best performing detectors used commercially. This has the potential to make medical imaging safer, and open up new opportunities in non-invasive diagnostics, such as X-ray video techniques. Their results are reported in the journal Nature Communications.          \"We have developed BiOI single crystals into X-ray detectors that work over 100 times better than the current state-of-the-art for medical imaging,\" said Dr. Robert Hoye from the University of Oxford, who led the work. \"BiOI is nontoxic, stable in air, and can be grown cost-effectively and at scale. We are very excited by the potential BiOI has to make the next generation of non-invasive diagnostics more accessible, safer, and more effective.\"BiOI is a nontoxic semiconductor that absorbs visible light and is stable in air. Owing to these qualities, over the past decade there has been a surge of interest in this material for solar cells (turning sunlight into clean electricity), photoelectrochemical cells (turning sunlight into fuels) and energy harvesting to power smart devices, among many other applications.BiOI contains two heavy elements\u2014bismuth and iodine\u2014which allows the material to strongly absorb X-rays. However, previous attempts to make BiOI into X-ray detectors were ineffective due to significant energy losses from defects arising from the nanocrystalline nature of the detectors made.The researchers developed and patented a method to grow high-quality single crystals of BiOI using a scalable vapor-based approach. The low defect density in these crystals led to stable and ultra-low dark currents, which was critical to substantially improve the sensitivity and detection limit of this material to X-rays.\"Showing that these simply-processed, low-temperature grown, stable crystals can give such high sensitivity for X-ray detection is quite remarkable,\" said Professor Judith Driscoll from Cambridge's Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, who co-led the work. \"We began working on this material, BiOI, several years ago, and we find it outshines other rival materials in a range of optoelectronic and sensing applications, when toxicity and performance are considered together.\"The researchers formed an interdisciplinary team to understand why BiOI works so well as an X-ray detector. They used advanced optical techniques to resolve processes taking place over a trillionth of a second, and coupled these with simulations to link these processes with what is happening at the atomic level.      Through this study, the team revealed the unusual way in which electrons couple to vibrations in the lattice. Unlike other bismuth-halide compounds, the electrons in BiOI remain delocalized, meaning that electrons can easily and rapidly move within the lattice of BiOI. At the same time, the unusual electron coupling with lattice vibrations results in an irreversible energy loss channel that would still be present even if the material were defect-free.The researchers found that these losses can be overcome by cooling down the sample to reduce thermal energy, or by applying an electric field to rip away electrons from the lattice. The latter case is ideally matched with how X-ray detectors operate. By applying a small electric field, electrons can be transported over a millimeter length-scale, allowing the efficient extraction of electrons generated in the single crystals through the absorption of X-rays.\"We have built a microscopic quantum mechanical model of electrons and ions that can fully explain the remarkable optoelectronic properties of BiOI that make it such a good material for X-ray detection,\" said Dr. Bartomeu Monserrat from Cambridge's Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, who co-led the project. \"This gives us a roadmap for designing even more materials with similarly advantageous properties.\"This work offers important insights into how delocalised charge-carriers can be achieved in bismuth-halide compounds. The researchers are now working on applying these insights to design materials with similarly advantageous properties as BiOI, as well as how to tune the composition of BiOI to improve its transport properties further. They are also working on bringing the unique benefits of BiOI to society by devising routes to increase the size of the BiOI detectors, while preserving the exceptional properties found in single crystals.

  "answer_squad": " nectar",
  "text": "Theories abound for why some people are mosquito magnets while others get off bite-free. A team of researchers from Virginia Tech report May 10 in the journal iScience that washing with some soaps attracted mosquitoes, while other soaps were repellent, but these effects varied between different people as a result of interactions between the soaps and each person's unique odor profile.          \"It's remarkable that the same individual that is extremely attractive to mosquitoes when they are unwashed can be turned even more attractive to mosquitoes with one soap, and then become repellent or repulsive to mosquitoes with another soap,\" says senior author and neuroethologist Cl\u00e9ment Vinauger.Humans have been using soaps and other perfumed personal products since antiquity. We know that soaps change our perception of each other's body odor, but it's less clear whether these products also change how mosquitoes perceive and discriminate between us as possible blood donors. Mosquitoes don't feed on blood alone\u2014in fact, their main food source is plant nectar\u2014so dousing ourselves with plant-derived or plant-mimicking scents could potentially confuse their decision-making.To explore the relationship between soap application and attractiveness to mosquitoes, the researchers first characterized the chemical odors emitted by four human volunteers, both when unwashed and after they'd washed themselves with each of four brands of soap\u2014Dial, Dove, Native, and Simple Truth. They also characterized the odor profiles of the soaps themselves.The team found that each of the volunteers emitted their own unique odor profile, some of which were more attractive to mosquitoes than others. Soap-washing significantly changed these odor profiles, and not only by adding floral fragrances to the mix.\"Everybody smells different, even after the application of soap; your physiological status, the way you live, what you eat, and the places you go all affect the way you smell,\" says co-author and biologist Chlo\u00e9 Lahond\u00e8re. \"And soaps drastically change the way we smell, not only by adding chemicals, but also by causing variations in the emission of compounds that we are already naturally producing.\"Next, the researchers compared the relative attractiveness of each human volunteer to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes when unwashed versus an hour after using the different soaps. Because male mosquitoes feed exclusively on nectar, and females only feed on blood after mating, the researchers exclusively tested the attractiveness for adult female mosquitoes who had recently mated. They also excluded the effects of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2)\u2014another important cue for mosquitoes\u2014by conducting the mosquito preference trials on fabric that had absorbed the human volunteer's odors rather than on the humans themselves.      Soap-washing impacted the mosquitoes' preferences, but the size and direction of this impact differed between soap types and between the human volunteers. Washing with Dove and Simple Truth increased the attractiveness of some (but not all) volunteers, while washing with Native soap tended to repel mosquitoes.\"What really matters to the mosquito is not the most abundant chemical, but rather the specific associations and combinations of chemicals, not only from the soap, but also from our personal body odors,\" says Vinauger. \"All of the soaps contained a chemical called limonene which is a known mosquito repellent, but in spite of that being the main chemical in all four soaps, three out of the four soaps we tested increased mosquitoes' attraction.\"\"We know that ratios of chemicals are extremely important for determining whether mosquitoes are attracted or repelled,\" says Lahond\u00e8re. \"Changing the ratio of the same exact chemicals can result in attraction, indifference, or repulsion.\"To identify the specific ingredients that attract and repel mosquitoes, the researchers analyzed the chemical compositions of the different soaps in light of their impacts on mosquito preference. They identified four chemicals associated with mosquito attraction and three chemicals associated with repulsion, including a coconut-scented chemical that is a key component in American Bourbon and a floral compound used to treat scabies and lice. The team combined these chemicals to create and test attractive and repellent odor blends, which had strong impacts on mosquito preference.\"With these mixtures, we eliminated all the noise in the signal by only including those chemicals that the statistics were telling us are important for attraction or repulsion,\" says Vinauger. \"I would choose a coconut-scented soap if I wanted to reduce mosquito attraction.\"The team intends to expand these results and find some general patterns or rules by testing more soap varieties and many more people. They also plan to explore how soap impacts mosquito preference over a longer period of time. \"We're very curious to look at the time course of this effect\u2014so for example, if you take a shower in the morning, does it still matter to mosquitoes in the evening?\" says Vinauger.

  "text": "An unusual quasicrystal has been discovered by a team from the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU), the University of Sheffield and Xi'an Jiaotong University. It has a dodecagonal honeycomb structure that has never been seen before. Until now, similar quasicrystals were only known to come in a solid\u2014not liquid\u2014form. The team presents its results in the journal Nature Chemistry.          Quasicrystals have a special structure. They have a regular pattern similar to normal crystals, however, in normal crystals, the arrangement of the individual components is repeated over and over at regular intervals. In the case of quasicrystals, the components do not fit together in such a periodic pattern. This special structure gives them special properties that normal crystals do not have.The newly discovered quasicrystal consists of dodecagons, which in turn are made up of a mixture of triangular, square and, for the first time, trapezoidal shaped cells. These are generated from the self-assembly of \"T-shaped\" molecules. \"We have discovered a perfectly ordered liquid quasicrystal. Such a material has never been seen before,\" says chemist Professor Carsten Tschierske at MLU.The team's latest study also provides new insights into the formation of these special structures. \"Until now, it was assumed that the stability of quasicrystals was based on an entropy gain resulting from the breaking of strict periodic tessellation rules. However, our results suggest that, in this case, the stability may be due to energy minimization in the perfect quasicrystalline order,\" Tschierske adds.According to the researcher, the potential applications for these new liquid quasicrystals are promising. For example, they could be used in the future to produce functional self-assembling and self-healing materials which could be applied in optics and electronics, as they have the potential to create new ways to manipulate light and charge carriers.

  "answer_squad": " breathalyzer",
  "text": "With each breath, humans exhale more than 1,000 distinct molecules, producing a unique chemical fingerprint or \"breathprint\" rich with clues about what's going on inside the body.          For decades, scientists have sought to harness that information, turning to dogs, rats and even bees to literally sniff out cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis and more.Scientists from CU Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have made an important leap forward in the quest to diagnose disease using exhaled breath, reporting that a new laser-based breathalyzer powered by artificial intelligence (AI) can detect COVID-19 in real-time with excellent accuracy.The results were published April 5 in the Journal of Breath Research.\"Our results demonstrate the promise of breath analysis as an alternative, rapid, non-invasive test for COVID-19 and highlight its remarkable potential for diagnosing diverse conditions and disease states,\" said first author Qizhong Liang, a Ph.D. candidate in JILA and the Department of Physics at CU Boulder. JILA is a partnership between CU Boulder and NIST.The multidisciplinary team of physicists, biochemists and biologists is now shifting its focus to a wide range of other diseases in hopes that the \"frequency comb breathalyzer\"\u2014born of Nobel Prize-winning technology from CU\u2014could revolutionize medical diagnostics.\"There is a real, foreseeable future in which you could go to the doctor and have your breath measured along with your height and weight\u2026Or you could blow into a mouthpiece integrated into your phone and get information about your health in real-time,\" said senior author Jun Ye, a JILA fellow and adjoint professor of physics at CU Boulder. \"The potential is endless.\"A COVID-born collaborationAs far back as 2008, Ye's lab reported that a technique called frequency comb spectroscopy\u2014essentially using laser light to distinguish one molecule from another\u2014could potentially identify biomarkers of disease in human breath.The technology lacked sensitivity and, more importantly, the capability to link specific molecules to disease states, so they never tested it for diagnosing illness.But Ye's team has since improved the sensitivity a thousandfold, enabling detection of trace molecules at the parts-per-trillion level. They've also harnessed the power of AI.\"Molecules increase or decrease in concentrations when associated with specific health conditions,\" said Liang. \"Machine learning analyzes this information, identifies patterns and develops criteria we can use to predict a diagnosis.\"With SARS-CoV-2 ripping across the country and frustration mounting about long response times for existing tests, the time had come to test the system on people. As a physicist, Ye had never worked with human subjects, so he enlisted help from CU's BioFrontiers Institute, an interdisciplinary hub for biomedical research which was heading up the campus COVID testing program.      Non-invasive, fast, chemical-freeBetween May 2021 and January 2022, the research team collected breath samples from 170 CU Boulder students who had, in the previous 48 hours, taken a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, either by submitting a saliva or a nasal sample.Half had tested positive, half negative. (For safety reasons, volunteer participants came to an outdoor campus parking lot, blew in a sample-collection bag and left it for a lab tech waiting at a safe distance.)Overall, the process took less than one hour from collection to result.When compared to PCR, the gold standard COVID test, breathalyzer results matched 85% of the time. For medical diagnostics, accuracy of 80% or greater is considered \"excellent.\"The resesarchers suspect that the accuracy would likely have been higher if the breath and saliva/nasal swab samples were collected at the same time.Unlike a nasal swab, the breathalyzer is non-invasive. And unlike a saliva sample, users are not asked to refrain from eating, drinking or smoking before using it. It doesn't require costly chemicals to break down the sample. And the new test could, conceivably, be used on individuals who are not conscious.But there is still much to be learned, said Ye.\"With one breath, we can collect so many data points from you, but then what? We only understand how a few molecules correlate with specific conditions,\" Ye said.Building a smaller breathalyzerToday, the \"breathalyzer\" consists of a complex array of lasers and mirrors about the size of a banquet table.A breath sample is piped in through a tube as lasers fire invisible mid-infrared light at it at thousands of different frequencies. Dozens of tiny mirrors bounce the light back and forth through the molecules so many times that in the end, the light travels about 1.5 miles.Because each kind of molecule absorbs light differently, breath samples with a different molecular make-up cast distinct shadows. The machine can distinguish between those different shadows or absorption patterns, boiling millions of data points down to\u2014in the case of COVID\u2014a simple positive or negative, in a matter of seconds.Efforts are already underway to miniaturize such systems to a chip scale, allowing for what Liang imagines as \"real-time, self-health monitoring on the go.\" The potential does not end there.\"What if you could find a signature in breath that could detect pancreatic cancer before you were even symptomatic. That would be the home run,\" said molecular biologist and co-author Leslie Leinwand, chief scientific officer for BioFrontiers and a co-author on the studyElsewhere, scientists are working to develop a Human Breath Atlas, which maps each molecule in the human exhale and correlates them with health outcomes. Liang hopes to contribute to such efforts with a larger-scale collection of breath samples.Meanwhile, the team is collaborating with pediatric and respiratory specialists at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus to explore how the breathalyzer can not only diagnose diseases but also enable scientists to better understand them, offering hints about immune responses, nutritional deficiencies and other factors that could contribute to or exacerbate illness.\"If you think about dogs, they evolved over thousands of years to smell many different things with remarkable sensitivity,\" said Ye. \"We are just at the very beginning of training our laser-based nose. The more we teach it, the smarter it will be come.\" More information:Qizhong Liang et al, Breath analysis by ultra-sensitive broadband laser spectroscopy detects SARS-CoV-2 infection, Journal of Breath Research (2023).

  "text": "A team of scientists from the University of Ottawa has developed an innovative technique to manufacture complex chemical structures from easily accessible substrates, making it one of the simplest and most practical methods for converting alcohols into their arylated equivalents.          This innovative method for performing the reaction, namely the deoxygenative Suzuki-Miyaura arylation of aliphatic alcohols, uses two distinct metal catalysts. Their reaction operates under mild reaction conditions with minimal waste products and is expected to have a significant impact on the creation of new molecules. As a result, it will contribute to advances in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and related industries.The study has been published in Nature Synthesis.This research was carried out at the University of Ottawa's Newman Lab under the supervision of Professor Stephen G. Newman, an associate professor of chemistry and biomolecular sciences at the Faculty of Science who holds a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in Sustainable Catalysis. The lead author of the research was Adam Cook, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate, and the second author was Piers St. Onge, a third-year Ph.D. candidate.\"The chemical reaction that we have developed, making extensive use of the high-throughput labs in uOttawa's Centre for Catalysis Research and Innovation, eliminates previous limitations in Suzuki-Miyaura arylations by offering a surprisingly simple method to achieve the direct derivatization of a broad range of easily accessible alcohols,\" explains Cook.\"By using these molecules as starting materials instead of more established organohalides, this method generates water as a waste product rather than metal-halide salts. This reaction not only provides an effective method for generating complex, medicinally relevant structures from accessible materials, but also contributes to fundamental developments in how chemical feedstocks may be directly transformed into important materials using catalysis,\"Current methods for Suzuki-Miyaura arylation, one of the most widely used chemical reactions in the world, require multiple synthetic steps to obtain the necessary starting materials.By developing a method that allows naturally abundant alcohols to be used directly in these transformations, \"we eliminate the need for these wasteful and time-consuming synthetic steps, thereby streamlining the process of converting naturally abundant substances into value-added products. Additionally, we were able to pursue a unique mechanistic hypothesis on route towards this goal through cross-coupling reactions via an SN1-type pathway,\" says Cook.This is a previously underexplored topic in synthetic chemistry and the team of researchers hopes that their work will serve as a valuable inspiration to all scientists. \"No matter how 'out there' your hypothesis may be, high-throughput experimentation can help you reach conclusions in a rapid and comprehensive manner,\" says Cook.By harnessing the power of this new technique, scientists can now create a wide range of arylated alcohols with greater efficiency and precision than ever before.

  "answer_squad": " Chanel No. 5",
  "text": "Mother's Day is coming up in Australia and that means a surge in perfume sales. Of course, scents are purchased year-round and not just for mothers. Fragrance sales in Australia will amount to over A$1 billion this year.          The word \"perfume\" is derived from the Latin per fumus, meaning \"through smoke\". The very first account of using perfumes dates back to 1200 BC when a woman called Tapputi mixed flowers, oils and various plants with water or solvents, then extracted their fragrance. The basis of this technique for making perfume is still used today.But how do we smell? What makes perfume appealing? And why does it smell differently on different people?The science of smellA sense of smell is vital to all species on Earth. One study identified African elephants as having the \"best noses\" in the animal kingdom, not to mention the longest ones. It can help animals sniff out danger, food and mates.For humans, too, being able to smell is not just for the enjoyment of pleasant odors. It can also protect us from toxic chemicals with noxious smells, such as hydrogen cyanide.When something has an odor, it means it is chemically volatile\u2014vaporizing from a liquid to a gas. When we smell a scent, gas molecules enter our nose and stimulate specialized nerve cells called olfactory sensory neurons. When these neurons are triggered, they send a signal to the brain to identify the chemicals.Humans have around 10 million of those neurons and around 400 scent receptors. The human nose can distinguish at least 1 trillion different odors, from freshly brewed coffee to wet dog to moldy cheese.The more volatile a compound is the lower its boiling point and, from a chemical perspective, the weaker the forces holding the molecules together. When this is the case, more molecules enter the gaseous state and the smell is more intense.      What makes things smell good though?Different classes of chemical compounds can have more pleasant or offensive scents.Fish and decaying animal cells, for example, release chemicals called amines, which don't smell appealing.Fruits, on the other hand, are composed of chemicals in a class of organic compounds called aldehydes, esters and ketones, which have sweeter and more pleasant odors.Chemists have been able to identify the specific chemical smells released by substances we encounter in everyday life.Smells differentSo it makes sense that pleasant-smelling aldehydes, ketones and esters are used to create perfumes. However, some perfumes also contain unusual ingredients that don't smell nice on their own.For example, Chanel No. 5 perfume\u2014the iconic 100-year-old favorite\u2014contains civet as one of its base chemical notes. Civet is used by perfumers for its long-lasting, musky scent. It is traditionally extracted from the anal glands of civet cats but Chanel has used a synthetic form of civet since 1998.Tips for choosing and using perfumesOur ability to smell a perfume will depend on two factors: how well our olfactory sensory neurons are performing (a virus or infection could affect function, for example) and the volatility of the chemicals in the perfume.1. Try before you buyYou can't really do much about your sensory neurons, but you can increase the intensity of perfumes, such as by warming up the perfume on your skin or applying to pulse points. This will help to give molecules more energy and increase the number of molecules entering the gaseous state.Specific perfumes will not smell the same on different people's skin because the chemicals in them can be affected by the skin's type and condition (dry or oily, acidic or base) and even their diet. Some foods we eat, such as garlic, are released from our bodies through our skin. Those chemicals can mask perfume chemicals.So, it is better to buy someone their tried and true favorite scent rather than risking a new one. And those department store sample sprays can be useful to try before you buy.2. Moisturize before useWhen you spray perfume on very dry skin, some of the perfume's chemicals\u2014the large organic ones that are similar to skin's natural oils\u2014are absorbed by the skin and then into the sebaceous glands. When some notes in a perfume are absorbed this way, it can take on a different smell. That's also why it's better to moisturize skin before spraying perfume, so perfume chemicals stay on the skin for longer.3. Experiment with spraying techniquesTo avoid changes in the scent of your favorite perfume and increase the time the perfume stays on you, you could spray your hair instead. Your hair is porous so perfume molecules might remain there longer. However, most perfumes contain alcohol, which dries out hair. Spraying perfume directly onto a hairbrush first, then brushing your hair, might prevent some of this drying effect.Spraying then walking through a mist of perfume so the chemicals settle on your hair, skin and clothes might work\u2014but you risk losing a lot of precious perfume with that technique.4. Keep it coolTemperature will affect volatility. To keep perfumes lasting longer in the bottle, keep them in the fridge or cool dark place and tightly sealed to prevent your expensive, heat-sensitive scent evaporating into thin air.

  "text": "Making the dynamics of an excited molecule visible is only possible using computationally intensive simulations. Recently, a research team led by Sandra Luber from the University of Zurich has developed a method that speeds up these complex simulations.          Theoretical chemist Sandra Luber wants to know exactly what is going on: How do electrons behave in a molecule when it is excited with a laser pulse and made to oscillate? In experimental setups, researchers measure the energy spectra of the excited electrons with a detector and thereby obtain an electronic adsorption spectrum of the molecule, for example. But what happens to the electrons in the time between the laser pulse and the resulting spectrogram remains hidden\u2014only supercomputers like Piz Daint can make that visible.Calculating such dynamic processes in spectroscopy is time-consuming and cost-intensive, which means that even world-class supercomputers can only simulate small systems. However, Luber, a professor of theoretical chemistry at the University of Zurich, together with her Ph.D. student Ruocheng Han and postdoc Johann Mattiat, recently presented an algorithm in Nature Communications that works ten times faster, and without sacrificing accuracy.Luber and her team employed Piz Daint to model the excited molecules dynamics, including the quantum mechanical states. To do this, they used software packages such as CP2K that contain methods for calculating the quantum mechanical states in the atom or molecule in real time. This enabled them to follow how the wave function of the electrons changed over time after the laser pulse.Most importantly, they could see how the higher energy levels induced by the laser are occupied by the electrons and could take \"detailed pictures\" of the molecule at any point in the experiment. \"This helps us analyze the structure and dynamics of a molecule,\" said Luber.In order to avoid trial and error, the researchers ideally wanted to develop an automated method for speeding up these calculations. Specifically, the algorithm that the team created now optimizes the so-called basis sets of functions that then CP2K, for example, uses for the calculations.The team achieved this by identifying two indicators: one indicator that can be used to capture the importance of each basis function for calculating the spectrum; and another indicator that provides information about how important they are for correctly tracking the quantum mechanical states over time.Using Piz Daint, the researchers tested their new algorithm on various molecules, ranging from molecular hydrogen and water to a silver cluster and zinc phthalocyanine among other important molecules for industry. With the new algorithm, the researchers reached their goal faster and with the same precision, as comparisons of the simulated absorption spectra with conventionally modeled spectra showed. All other quantum mechanical programs besides CP2K that also use atom-centered basis sets could use the new procedure, Luber said.What is going on in the excited moleculesOptimized basis sets already exist for calculations of molecules mainly in the ground state. \"However, such special basis sets for the simulation of excited molecular states did not exist until now,\" Luber said. \"What's more, our newly generated basis sets are even system and environment specific.\"The researchers made this surprising discovery during test simulations of silver atoms within silver clusters, which have different chemical properties depending on the symmetry and environment in the cluster. \"We could observe that our algorithm even finds different basis sets for these different silver atoms,\" said Luber.This means that the algorithm distinguishes the environments in the molecule: If, for instance, the polarization of the electron density is important, the algorithm adds polarization functions; for larger distances from the atom it adds diffuse functions. \"We can see which type of function is important in which area of the atom or molecule. This gives us a lot of additional information about the molecule's chemistry.\" Luber and her team have thus come a lot closer to their goal of knowing exactly what is going on in the excited molecules.

  "text": "Fatigue, accompanied by a modern life style and high-intensity exercise, has become a common human condition. Human health is closely related to the function of immune system, and the impairment of this system will also lead to fatigue. Researchers therefore are working to develop natural anti-fatigue and immune-enhancing compounds without side-effects.          Recently, a team led by Prof. Li Pengcheng from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS) obtained the special sequence of peptides from a monkfish (Lophius litulon) protein, and proved that monkfish peptides had anti-fatigue and immunity-enhancing effects. They also found that monkfish peptides could regulate immune function by regulating receptors involved in inflammatory responses. The study was published in the Journal of Functional Foods.The researchers used a series of separation and purification techniques, including ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography and reverse high-performance liquid chromatography, to obtain specific sequences of peptides. They found the peptides could significantly increase antioxidant enzyme activities, hepatic glycogen and lactate dehydrogenase contents, and decrease blood urea nitrogen and blood lactic acid contents in exercise-induced fatigue mice.In addition, they found the monkfish peptides could enhance spleen lymphocyte proliferation and the activity of natural killer cells in mice. Transcriptomics analysis showed that there were 205 genes up-regulated and 1,040 genes down-regulated after the mice were fed monkfish peptides. The peptides could inhibit inflammatory cytokines activation by down-regulating the chemokine and Nucleotide Oligomerization Domain (NOD)\u2013like receptor signaling pathways, thereby modulating the mouse immune response.\"The monkfish peptides could be applied in health care products associated with anti-fatigue and immunity enhancing,\" said Wang Xueqin, first author of the study.

  "text": "Droplet microfluidics allows for quicker point-of-care testing (POCT), but it is not always as accurate and currently requires an amount of external effort for proper handling.          The Integrated Portable Droplets system, or iPODs, developed by researchers from the Single-Cell Center at Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology (QIBEBT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), is based on an auto flow-focusing droplet reinjection chip that eliminates the need for external pumps and precise fluid control, allowing for portability, lower costs, and a user-friendly method of droplet analysis.The study was published in Analytical Chemistry on April 13.The researchers found results to be promising: The automated style in which the droplets transfer through the instrument reduces the need for manual operation, thereby reducing the chance of error, cross-contamination, and sample loss.They also found a strong linearity of samples measured between 101 to 104 copies of bacteria per microliter with an R2 value of 0.999. The closer an R2 value is to 1, the better the line is able to visually represent how well the iPODs device (the independent variable) can detect and quantify the bacterial species present in the sample (the dependent variable).Additionally, the device cost and subsequent cost of each use are reasonable enough to be affordable on a large scale. Another unique and important aspect of the device is its portability, which allows for the device to be used in a broader setting, such as outdoor settings or decentralized labs.\"In previous reports, droplet reinjection undoubtedly requires precise fluid control, thereby reducing the portability of the device, more seriously, restricting the development of droplet-based nucleic acid amplification testing for POCT,\" said Liu Fengyi, a doctoral student and first author of the study. \"Here, we showed this droplet reinjection chip greatly simplified the experimental setup and operation procedure with low device cost and low reagent consumption.\"Droplet microfluidic testing consists of taking a small amount of fluid for testing, which often features cell manipulation and single-cell or single-molecule analysis. One issue iPODs addresses is the relatively low quantitative detection levels of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) when done in bulk, which just gives an \"all or nothing\" result.Droplet digital LAMP with iPODs makes it highly sensitive and accurate in assessing quantities of nucleic acids present in the sample. The downside to this is the need for precise fluid control and external pumps, all of which reduce portability and increase costs. \"We present a droplet reinjection method capable of droplet distribution without precise fluid control and external pumps, by which the droplets can be passively aligned and detected one by one at intervals,\" said Ge Anle, contributing author and assistant research fellow.Using iPODs, the external pump and the need for precise fluid control are eliminated due to the integration of the droplet generator, heating tool, and fluorescent signal reader all packaged in a small, retractable box.In order for this technology to reach its full potential, some adjustments will be needed in the future, such as improving the stability of the system, and implanting of thermal cycling modules for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Further implant with other cheap chip materials for large standardized production, as well as introduction of fully automated operation processes will make the system more user-friendly.\"Once the device is fully developed, we hope to see the technology used in a wide array of applications, from biochemical testing at a point-of-care level to in a more clinical research-based setting,\" said corresponding author Prof. Ma Bo from the Single-Cell Center.

The study was published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials.       Advances in medicine have led to an increase in the production and use of antibiotics. Treatment of antibiotics in wastewater has become an urgent practical problem that requires immediate attention. The development of effective methods to remove antibiotics from wastewater is crucial to protect both the environment and human health.In this study, the researchers treated antibiotic mixtures using cold atmospheric plasma jet (CAPJ) in combination with plasma-activated water.Using this method, the efficiency of treating mixed antibiotics was found to be higher than that of treating single antibiotics under appropriate conditions. For example, when plasma was used to decompose chloramphenicol, active chlorine was produced, which increased the treatment efficiency of norfloxacin.

  "text": "A team of Florida State University researchers has further developed a new generation of organic-inorganic hybrid materials that can improve image quality in X-ray machines, CT scans and other radiation detection and imaging technologies.          Professor Biwu Ma from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and his colleagues have developed a new class of materials that can act as highly efficient scintillators, which emit light after being exposed to other forms of high energy radiations, such as X-rays.The team's most recent study, published in Advanced Materials, is an improvement upon their previous research to develop better scintillators. The new design concept produces materials that can emit light within nanoseconds, orders of magnitude faster than previously developed materials, allowing for better imaging.\"Reducing the radioluminescence decay lifetime of scintillators to nanoseconds is an important breakthrough,\" Ma said. \"Using a hybrid material made up of both organic and inorganic components means each component can be used for the part of the process where it is most effective.\"Why is this important?Scintillators are used in all sorts of imaging applications. Health care settings, security X-rays, radiation detectors and other technologies use them and would benefit from better image quality.The new generation of organic metal halide hybrid scintillators developed by Ma's team has numerous improvements over existing ones. In addition to significantly better radioluminescence response, the manufacturing process is simpler than the process used for other scintillators, and it uses abundant and cheap materials.What's different about this scintillator?Think of a scintillator as a sort of translator between two types of energy, taking a form of high energy radiation, such as an X-ray, and converting it into visible light. Less radiation passes through denser parts of an object, and that difference can be used to distinguish higher-density objects, such as bones or metal, from lower-density ones, such as soft tissue. The radiation that passes through an object then interacts with the scintillator, which generates visible light that is detected by a sensor to make an image.Today's scintillators use mainly inorganic materials to transform high energy radiation into visible light for producing images. These materials are rigid, use rare Earth elements, and require energy-consuming, high-temperature manufacturing processes.Ma and his team have been working on zero-dimensional organic metal halide hybrids, with which they have performed pioneering research since 2018. These organic-inorganic hybrids are made of small groups of negatively charged inorganic components, called metal halide clusters, and positively charged organic molecules. They're \"zero-dimensional\" at the molecular level because the metal halide clusters are fully isolated and surrounded by organic molecules.In the first version of scintillators based on this material, the metal halides absorb high energy radiation and emit visible light. In this latest iteration, metal halide components and organic molecules work together. The metal halides absorb high energy radiation and transfer energy to the organic components, which emit visible light.Light emissions from organic molecules take place on the scale of nanoseconds, much faster than the microseconds or milliseconds required for metal halides to emit light.\"The faster the decay of radioluminescence, the more precise we can measure the timing of photon emissions,\" Ma said. \"That leads to higher resolution and contrast in images.\"What's next?With the help of the FSU Office of Commercialization, Ma and his team have filed patents on organic metal halide hybrid scintillators. The office's GAP Commercialization Investment Program provided funding to develop the technology for potential partnerships with private companies, which would make the scintillators available on a wider scale.\"This is a continuation of our push for better materials over the years, from 2018, when we first discovered this class of materials, to 2020, when we used them for scintillation for the first time,\" Ma said. \"This is another major breakthrough.\" More information:Tunde Blessed Shonde et al, Molecular Sensitization Enabled High Performance Organic Metal Halide Hybrid Scintillator, Advanced Materials (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the technique used to study the adhesion of bacteria to surfaces?",
  "answer_squad": " QCM-D",
  "text": "A recent study by Tokyo Tech researchers has found that the biofilm-forming bacteria E. coli adheres firmly to hydrophobic and hydrophilic protein-adsorbing self-assembling monolayers (SAMs) and weakly to hydrophilic protein-resisting SAMs. These findings on how surface chemistry can influence the adhesion of bacterial cells and, in turn, biofilm formation could inform the development of bacteria-resistant surfaces and antibiofouling coatings for biomedical and industrial devices.          Bacterial biofilms are like a double-edged sword. On one hand, they have proven valuable for electricity generation and degradation of toxic materials in water and soil but on the other hand, they are a nuisance when formed inside drinking water pipes, on contact lenses and on biomedical devices. To form biofilms, the bacterial cells first attach to the surface of materials via weak and reversible bonds. Once these bonds mature, the cells release polymeric substances that result in stable and irreversible biofilms.Decoding the mechanism underlying irreversible biofilm formation and its relation to surface chemistry is key to unlocking biofilm prevention technologies. Over the years, scientists have proposed various techniques to narrow down the types of surfaces bacterial cells tend to adhere to. Unfortunately, the influence of surface chemistry and surface topography on biofilm formation have remained ambiguous.Against this backdrop, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Tomohiro Hayashi from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan, set out to address this knowledge gap. In a recent breakthrough published in ACS Applied Bio Materials, the team investigated the adhesion mechanism of the E. coli bacteria on self-assembling monolayers (SAM) comprising different terminal groups, i.e., different surface chemistries, using optical microscopy and a technique called \"quartz crystal microbalance with energy dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring.\"Dr. Hayashi explains, \"We chose QCM-D because it is an ultrasensitive device that can monitor adsorbed masses as small as nanograms using acoustic waves. Similarly, SAMs with tunable terminal groups functionalized on atomically flat QCM sensors were chosen since they can help untangle the influence of surface chemistry from that of substrate topography on bacterial attachment.\"      Studies have shown that bacterial attachment to a surface cannot be fully explained by the conventional mass loading theory. This is because the theory does not explain the positive and negative shifts in the resonant frequency (f) caused by adsorption of additional mass onto the surface, which significantly impacts biofilm formation. Taking this complex behavior into account through a coupled-resonator model, the team examined the changes in f and the energy dissipation (D) of the QCM sensor oscillation and assessed their impact on bacterial attachment and viscoelasticity of the SAM surfaces with different functionalities.                Figure 1. Plot of energy dissipation(D) vs shift in resonant frequency (f) for hydrophobic and hydrophilic protein-adsorbing SAMs and hydrophilic protein-resisting SAM at n =3 (3rd overtone, red) and n = 13 (13th overtone, blue) to understand time progression of bacterial adhesion. Credit: Prof.Tomohiro Hayashi             The microscopy images along with QCM-D data revealed that E. coli adhered firmly to both hydrophobic (methyl-terminated) and hydrophilic protein-adsorbing (amine- and carboxy-terminated) SAMs (Figure 1a and b), forming dense bacterial films. In contrast, it attached weakly to hydrophilic protein-resisting SAMs (Figure 1c), such as oligo (ethylene glycol) and sulfobetaine, and formed sparse and dissipative biofilms.                Figure 2. By estimating the acoustic wave penetration depths at each overtone, the distances of E. coli cells from each SAM surface could be determined, providing a clue on what makes bacterial cells adhere strongly to some surfaces and only weakly to others. Credit: Prof. Tomohiro Hayashi             The team also observed a positive f shift for hydrophilic protein-resisting SAMs, due possibly to the fact that the bacterial appendages of E. coli played role in not only initiating contact with the surface and bonding but also in creating elastic spring-like links with the surface. Further, by estimating the distances of the bacterial cell bodies from different SAM surfaces based on the different acoustic wave penetration depths at each overtone (Figure 2), they provided a possible explanation of why bacterial cells adhere strongly to some surfaces and weakly to others.These valuable insights could help identify surfaces with higher probability of biofilm contamination as well as pave the way for contamination-resistant surfaces. \"Our study can act as practical guide for determining which surfaces are prone to bacterial fouling as well as for designing prevention strategies such as bacteria-resistant surfaces and antibiofouling coatings,\" concludes Dr. Hayashi.

  "text": "A research team led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley has engineered bacteria to produce new-to-nature carbon products that could provide a powerful route to sustainable biochemicals.          The advance\u2014which was recently announced in the journal Nature\u2014uses bacteria to combine natural enzymatic reactions with a new-to-nature reaction called the \"carbene transfer reaction.\" This work could also one day help reduce industrial emissions because it offers sustainable alternatives to chemical manufacturing processes that typically rely on fossil fuels.\"What we showed in this paper is that we can synthesize everything in this reaction\u2014from natural enzymes to carbenes\u2014inside the bacterial cell. All you need to add is sugar and the cells do the rest,\" said Jay Keasling, a principal investigator of the study and CEO of the Department of Energy's Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI).Carbenes are highly reactive carbon-based chemicals that can be used in many different types of reactions. For decades, scientists have wanted to use carbene reactions in the manufacturing of fuels and chemicals, and in drug discovery and synthesis.But these carbene processes could only be carried out in small batches via test tubes and required expensive chemical substances to drive the reaction.In the new study, the researchers replaced expensive chemical reactants with natural products that can be produced by an engineered strain of the bacteria Streptomyces.Because the bacteria use sugar to produce chemical products through cellular metabolism, \"this work enables us to perform the carbene chemistry without toxic solvents or toxic gases typically used in chemical synthesis,\" said first author Jing Huang, a Berkeley Lab postdoctoral researcher in the Keasling Lab. \"This biological process is much more environmentally friendly than the way chemicals are synthesized today,\" Huang said.During experiments at JBEI, the researchers observed the engineered bacterium as it metabolized and converted sugars into the carbene precursor and the alkene substrate. The bacterium also expressed an evolved P450 enzyme that used those chemicals to produce cyclopropanes, high-energy molecules that could potentially be used in the sustainable production of novel bioactive compounds and advanced biofuels.\"We can now perform these interesting reactions inside the bacterial cell. The cells produce all of the reagents and the cofactors, which means that you can scale this reaction to very large scales\" for mass manufacturing, Keasling said.Recruiting bacteria to synthesize chemicals could also play an integral role in reducing carbon emissions, Huang said. According to other Berkeley Lab researchers, close to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions come from the production of chemicals, iron and steel, and cement. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will require severely cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, says a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Huang said that while this fully integrated system can be envisioned for a large number of carbene donor molecules and alkene substrates, it is not yet ready for commercialization.\"For every new advance, someone needs to take the first step. And in science, it can take years before you succeed. But you have to keep trying\u2014we can't afford to give up. I hope our work will inspire others to continue searching for greener, sustainable biomanufacturing solutions,\" Huang said.

  "answer_squad": " Enantiomers",
  "text": "Recognizing and separating enantiomers is a difficult task for chemical engineers\u2014one might say it gives them a bit of a headache.          Enantiomers are molecules with virtually identical compositions that mirror one another, like a left and right hand. In chemistry, this property is called chirality. Despite the similarities in their makeup, so-called left- and right-handed enantiomers often exhibit very different properties. Sometimes a drug has an enantiomer that causes undesirable effects. For example, certain drugs have one enantiomer that can cause a headache, while the other provides relief.More than half of the top 500 drugs used in the United States are enantiomeric, according to Xiao Su, a researcher at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology and an assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Su, alongside UIUC doctoral student Jemin Jeon and research scientist Johannes Elbert, recently developed a system to electrochemically distinguish one enantiomer from its twin.The group's development has significant implications for the drug manufacturing industry. Because new drugs are typically required to be racemic \u2014containing an even 50-50 mixture of left- and right-handed enantiomers\u2014their system would allow drug developers to more easily determine the ratio of enantiomers in a given drug, and eventually lead to more effective methods of separating them.\"When you're producing a drug, you want to know how much of each enantiomer is in there,\" Elbert said. \"It's like a form of quality control.\"Their paper appears in Advanced Functional Materials.To effectively distinguish one enantiomer from its mirrored counterpart, the researchers used a versatile class of metal-containing polymers, also referred to as \"metallopolymers,\" that have been used for energy storage, water treatment, and selective separations. Historically, these metallopolymers have seen limited use for enantiomer recognition because they usually lack chirality, or handedness.By adding a chiral center to the metallopolymers, researchers can use them to electrochemically sense two enantiomeric molecules: for example, the molecules used in valuable pharmaceuticals.      \"The cool scientific advance here is that we're able to prove that these redox polymers with chirality can be very good sensors and interact with their preferred enantiomers,\" Su said.Enantiomer recognition begins with chemically designed building blocks on the polymer, referred to as \"redox-centers.\" Redox-centers allow the polymers to undergo reduction and oxidation (hence the polymers' portmanteau name) by electron transfer. This process allows the redox-centers from the polymers to selectivity bind, and thus sense, an enantiomer by changes in current and potential.\"We've basically created a class of chiral metallopolymers that can serve as platform for many enantioselective studies going forward,\" Su said.Furthermore, the study shows for the first time a phenomenon referred to as supramolecular chirality, an intriguing feature in which the polymer displays more chirality than the redox-center building blocks themselves. The researchers leverage this supramolecular chirality to amplify the sensing effect, an efficient upgrade from past sensing methods.\"With electrochemical methods, there's no need to add anything external like chemical additives,\" Su said. \"It's a sensing method purely based on electrical input and electrical readouts, making it flexible and modular to use.\"Although studies on chiral sensors already exist, many are limited to one-time use. But the Illinois researchers' sensor is mobilized onto an interface, allowing it to be reused.And while their newly developed sensor method is still considered proof of concept, the researchers have already identified their next steps.\"Now that we have proved the sensing and recognition properties, the next step is to translate these properties for separation\" Su said. \"Right now our system works really well for chiral sensing, but beyond that, we want to create devices and even better materials to be able to fully purify enantiomers.\" More information:Jemin Jeon et al, Chiral Metallopolymers for Redox\u2010Mediated Enantioselective Interactions, Advanced Functional Materials (2023).

  "text": "Glycans perform varied and crucial functions in numerous cellular activities. The diverse roles of glycans are matched by their highly complex structures, which derive from differences in composition, branching, regio- and stereochemistry, and modification. This incomparable structural diversity is challenging to the structural analysis of glycans.          Recently, a joint research group led by Prof. Qing Guangyan and Prof. Liang Xinmiao from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has developed a glycan identification method based on nanopore single-molecule sensing through a glycan derivatization strategy. The study was published in Nature Communications on March 28.Identifying and sequencing glycans using nanopore single-molecule techniques has sparked interest; however, it has achieved little progress over the past dozen years. Only a handful of cases that focused on either high molecular weight polysaccharides or some monosaccharides were reported.For smaller but structurally more diverse glycans with greater biological significance, single molecule detection with nanopores has not yet been achieved, largely because the fast passage of glycans through a nanopore cannot be sensed due to the small size and weak affinity of the glycan with the nanopore.To address the challenge, the researchers introduced a derivatization strategy by linking an aromatic-type tag group to small glycans via a high-efficiency and facile reductive amination reaction. The resulting tagged glycan was sensed with a wild-type aerolysin nanopore by presenting strong nanopore blockage signals.The researchers obtained a scatter plot based on blockage current and dwell time as the fingerprint map by processing the nanopore single-molecule blockage events. They identified different glycan isomers, glycans with varying lengths, and branched simple glycans.Moreover, they revealed that multiple cation-\u03c0 interactions between the aromatic tag of glycan with K238 residues of the nanopore interface retarded the translocation of the tagged glycan and contributed to sensing.\"This study pushes the boundary of nanopore sensing beyond its traditional focus on nucleic acid and protein, and activates its power in the glycomics and glycoscience field, which might pave the way towards nanopore glycan sequencing,\" said Prof. Qing.

  "text": "Researchers at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory captured one of the fastest movements of a molecule called ferricyanide for the first time by combining two ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy techniques. They think their approach could help map more complex chemical reactions like oxygen transportation in blood cells or hydrogen production using artificial photosynthesis.          The research team from SLAC, Stanford and other institutions started with what is now a fairly standard technique: They zapped a mixture of ferricyanide and water with an ultraviolet laser and bright X-rays generated by the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray free-electron laser. The ultraviolet light kicked the molecule into an excited state while the X-rays probed the sample's atoms, revealing features of ferricyanide's atomic and electronic structure and motion.What was different this time is how the researchers extracted information from the X-ray data. Instead of studying only one spectroscopic region, known as the K\u03b2 main emission line, the team captured and analyzed a second emission region, called valence-to-core, which has been significantly more challenging to measure on ultrafast timescales. Combining information from both regions enabled the team to obtain a detailed picture of the ferricyanide molecule as it evolved into a key transitional state.The team showed that ferricyanide enters an intermediate, excited state for about 0.3 picoseconds\u2014or less than a trillionth of a second\u2014after being hit with a UV laser. The valence-to-core readings then revealed that following this short-lived, excited period, ferricyanide loses one of its molecular cyanide \"arms,\" called a ligand. Ferricyanide then either fills this missing joint with the same carbon-based ligand or, less likely, a water molecule.\"This ligand exchange is a basic chemical reaction that was thought to occur in ferricyanide, but there was no direct experimental evidence of the individual steps in this process,\" SLAC scientist and first author Marco Reinhard said. \"With only a K\u03b2 main emission line analysis approach, we wouldn't really be able to see what the molecule looks like when it is changing from one state to the next; we'd only obtain a clear picture of the beginning of the process.\"\"You want to be able to replicate what nature does to improve technology and increase our foundational scientific knowledge,\" SLAC senior scientist Dimosthenis Sokaras said. \"And in order to better replicate natural processes, you have to know all of the steps, from the most obvious to those that happen in the dark, so to speak.\"In the future, the research team wants to study more complex molecules, such as hemeproteins, which transport and store oxygen in red blood cells\u2014but which can be tricky to study because scientists do not understand all the intermediate steps of their reactions, Sokaras said.The research team refined their X-ray spectroscopy technique at SLAC's Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) and LCLS over many years, and then combined all this expertise at LCLS's X-ray Correlation Spectroscopy (XCS) instrument to capture the molecular structural changes of ferricyanide. The team published their results today in Nature Communications.\"We leveraged both SSRL and LCLS to complete the experiment. We couldn't have finished developing our method without access to both facilities and our longstanding collaboration together,\" said Roberto Alonso-Mori, SLAC lead scientist. \"For years, we have been developing these methods at these two X-ray sources, and now we plan to use them to uncover previously inaccessible secrets of chemical reactions.\" More information:Marco Reinhard et al, Ferricyanide photo-aquation pathway revealed by combined femtosecond K\u03b2 main line and valence-to-core x-ray emission spectroscopy, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "As the executor of life activities, proteins exert their specific biological functions through interactions such as forming protein complexes. The localization effects, crowding effects, and organelle microenvironments within cells are crucial for maintaining the structure and function of protein complexes.          Recently, a research team led by Prof. Zhang Lihua from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has developed a glycosidic-bond-based mass-spectrometry-cleavable cross-linker, which improves the data analysis throughput and identification accuracy of cross-linking information with good amphiphilicity and biocompatibility. It enables in-vivo cross-linking of protein complexes in live cells and achieves large-scale and precise analysis. The study was published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition on March 30.Chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (CXMS), especially in-vivo CXMS, is a large-scale analysis of in-situ conformation and interaction interface of protein complexes in living cells. However, in-vivo CXMS in living cells faces challenges such as high cell disturbance and complex spectra retrieval of cross-linked peptides.In this study, the researchers incorporated glycosidic bonds into the design of functional cross-linkers based on the high biocompatibility of glucose molecules and the mass spectrometry cleavable feature of glycosidic bonds. They screened and obtained trehalose, a highly biocompatible molecule, as the skeleton molecule and developed a mass spectrometry cleavable cross-linker, trehalose disuccinimidyl succinate (TDS).This cross-linker showed superior cell viability maintenance compared to currently reported membrane-permeable chemical cross-linkers and enabled efficient cross-linking of protein complexes in cells under low disturbance conditions.The researchers found that low-energy glycosidic bond\u2013high-energy peptide bond mass spectrometry selective fragmentation mode reduced analysis complexity of the cross-linked peptide fragment spectra, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of cross-linked peptide identification.They identified conformation of 1,453 proteins corresponding to more than 3,500 cross-linked peptide pairs, and 843 protein-protein interaction information from Hela cells.\"We have accurately realized in-vivo cross-linking and global analysis of protein complexes in live cells, and provided an important toolkit for exploring the interaction sites of protein function regulation in live cell microenvironment,\" said Prof. Zhang.

  "text": "Water oxidation reaction involves a four-electron and four-proton transfer process, which requires an uphill energy transformation and limits the efficiency of the overall photocatalytic water splitting reaction.          Although loading appropriate water oxidation cocatalysts can enhance the performance of water oxidation reactions, the interfacial barrier between the semiconductor and the water oxidation cocatalyst can impede the transfer and utilization of photogenerated charges.Recently, a research team led by Profs. Li Can and Li Rengui from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has developed a strategy to controllably assemble a charge-transfer mediator in photocatalysis, which could increase surface charge-transfer efficiency and photocatalytic water oxidation activity. The study was published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition on March 23.Inspired by natural photosynthesis, the researchers employed partially oxidized graphene (pGO) as a charge-transferring mediator on the hole-accumulating facets of lead chromate (PbCrO4) photocatalyst. The pGO could be selectively assembled on the hole-accumulating facets of PbCrO4 by an ultrasonic deposition process, and cobalt-complex Co4O4 molecules could be anchored on the pGO as water oxidation cocatalyst.Based on techniques such as surface photovoltage spectroscopy, they confirmed that introducing the pGO charge transfer mediator between the hole-accumulation facets of PbCrO4 and Co4O4 molecules could effectively suppress charge recombination at the interface, thus prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated charges and enhancing photocatalytic water oxidation performance.\"The strategy of rationally assembling charge transfer mediator provides a feasible way for accelerating charge transfer and charge utilization in semiconductor photocatalysis,\" said Prof. Li Rengui.

  "answer_squad": " Cesium",
  "text": "Nuclear energy is crucial for producing cleaner energy, but the associated radioactive pollution requires strategic solutions. Cesium (Cs+) is a toxic radionuclide generated from nuclear power plants that demands immobilization and high adsorption methods to prevent environmental pollution.          Although phosphate-based adsorbents are excellent candidates for cleanup, their inefficient ion exchange leads to limited adsorption capacity. The high theoretical adsorption of phosphate adsorbents does not match their experimental adsorption capacities.To remove harmful Cs+ from radioactive wastewater, Pusan National University researchers led by Professor Kuk Cho from the Department of Environmental Engineering have synthesized dittmarite-type phosphates with a layered structure, ideal for easy ion exchange.The team found that their magnesium phosphates had record-high adsorption capacities for Cs+, surpassing standard adsorbents due to exchangeable ions and dissolution-precipitation. Prof. Cho says, \"The presence of exchangeable ions and dissolution-precipitation enabled record-high adsorption capacities for Cs+ that are higher than those of standard adsorbents.\"The study was published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials. Using a one-pot hydrothermal method, the team synthesized KMgPO4\u22c5H2O (KMP) and NH4MgPO4\u22c5H2O (NMP), both of which are dittmarite-type compounds, having a high theoretical adsorption capacity of 754 mg g\u2212 1 and 856 mg g\u2212 1 for Cs+, respectively.The synthesized KMP and NMP had remarkable adsorption capacities of 630 mg g\u22121 and 711 mg g\u22121, respectively, which were 84% of their theoretical adsorption capacities. These experimentally measured adsorption capacity values are the highest among all reported adsorbents for Cs+.Next, the team characterized and analyzed the physical and chemical properties of the phosphates. Based on the Cs+ adsorption performance of KMP and NMP, they showed that these phosphates are not best suited for use in water with high divalent ion concentrations. However, they can still be used in Cs+ readsorption processes, following desorption processes, to concentrate Cs+ and reduce waste volume.Prof. Cho says, \"Cs+ is a popular radionuclide generated from nuclear power plants, and the volume of its waste must be minimized for disposal. To minimize the volume, the adsorbent with higher adsorption capacity is advantageous.\"The study found that the new phosphates efficiently adsorb Cs+, providing a cost-effective method for radioactive waste disposal. This is particularly important in a world where nuclear power plants are expected to increase in number, and proper storage with appropriate adsorbents will become crucial for sustainability.In conclusion, the high adsorption capacities and stability of the synthesized phosphates make them promising candidates to deal with the radioactive waste disposal challenge.

  "text": "Adding long-chain fatty acids can thicken cell membranes and alter the activity of a key enzyme, as LMU scientists have demonstrated in cell cultures.          A characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease are deposits of the amyloid-\u03b2 protein, which clumps together to form plaques in the brain. The amyloid-\u03b2 protein is produced by an enzyme which resides in cellular membranes. A team lead by Prof. Harald Steiner and Dr. Edgar Dawkins from the Biomedical Center Munich at LMU has now shown that the production of amyloid-\u03b2 is influenced by the membrane thickness.Cellular membranes consist of lipid bilayers. By externally adding further lipids, they can be thickened, which alters their properties. In earlier studies, Steiner's team had already demonstrated in cell-free model systems that such changes affect the production of amyloid-\u03b2. This effect arises because the key enzyme for the production of amyloid-\u03b2, the so-called \u03b3-secretase, is localized inside the membrane.Remodeling in the cell membrane alters enzyme activityNow the researchers have demonstrated that these fundamental mechanisms also apply in cells. To this end, they started out by developing methods for modifying the properties of living cell membranes in cell cultures. In this way, they were able to show that the addition of a long-chain fatty acid\u2014a building block of the lipids\u2014did in fact lead to remodeling in the cell membranes. This modulation of the membrane composition was also associated with changes in the activity of the \u03b3-secretase.The way in which this influenced the production of amyloid-\u03b2 proved to be non-uniform: \"Although our goal was to suppress the production of amyloid-\u03b2, we ascertained that the lipid treatments have complex effects on the production of this protein in biological systems,\" reports Dawkins. \"Depending on the genetic background of the cells we used, we were able to reduce or increase the quantities of amyloid-\u03b2.\"Long-term, the scientists see the potential in their results for delivering new impetuses to lipid-based treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease. \"Our study contains important considerations in this regard, which researchers should look into when evaluating potential lipid-based approaches,\" says Steiner, although he emphasizes that their practical implementation remains far off in the future.The findings are published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.

  "answer_squad": " Faraday rotation spectroscopy",
  "text": "A research team led by Prof. Gao Xiaoming at the Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics (AIOFM), Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) recently proposed a new dual-wavelength Faraday rotation spectroscopy (FRS) sensor in the two-component simultaneous detection of nitrogen oxides.          Related research result was published in Sensors and Actuators: B. Chemical.Nitrogen oxides are at the center of atmospheric chemical reactions and influence the concentration of ozone, hydroxyl and peroxy radicals, which are important precursors for the formation of photochemical smog, acid rain and haze pollution. At the same time, nitrogen oxides emitted by agricultural fields, wetlands and other ecosystems play an important role in the global nitrogen cycle.In this research, Prof. Liu Kun and Cao Yuan et al. proposed a two-component simultaneous detection sensor for nitrogen oxides with static magnetic field FRS based on NdFeB ring magnet array in response to the problems of slow measurement rate and lack of selectivity for nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide in traditional chemiluminescence detection of nitrogen oxides.The interaction between two beams of linearly polarized light of different wavelengths and nitrogen oxides in a static magnetic field was facilitated by designing a single-cavity, dual-optical path gas absorption cell and coupling it coaxially to a NdFeB ring magnet array.                Optical layout of the FRS NOx sensor. Credit: Cao Yuan             Aside from that, they recommended that the absorption cell should be less than or equal to the length of permanent magnet ring array. This is to address the issue that the left and right sides of NdFeB ring magnetic array were opposite to the direction of internal axial magnetic field, causing partial cancelation of the magneto-optical signal excited by internal axial magnetic field.By combining wavelength modulation spectroscopy with a static magnetic field, the FRS NOx sensor achieved a detection sensitivity of 0.58 ppb NO2 and 0.95 ppb NO over an optical length of 23.7 m and an integration time of 100s.This work lays the foundation for further developing eddy covariance method-based studies of the soil-plant-atmosphere NOx interface fluxes in ecosystems.

  "answer_squad": " tortuosity",
  "text": "Researchers at Aalto University have discovered a new way to use biowaste to provide sound absorption and thermal insulation.          An effective use of sound absorption materials is needed to reduce noise pollution, which constitutes a major environmental and health problem. The current sound absorption materials can be harmful for the environment and often create waste problems at the end of their lifetime.The researchers found that pectin, a polysaccharide that can be extracted from biowastes such as fruit peels, can be converted into a freeze-dried highly porous material. They can outperform commercial sound absorption materials, such as glass wool and other porous materials with similar thickness. The research was published in the Chemical Engineering Journal.\"The porous material prepared in this work demonstrate the great potential of freeze-casted bio-based sound absorption materials to be employed as an alternative material in industrialization and construction, where environmental-friendly materials are needed. They also display low thermal conductivity and excellent thermal insulation performance,\" says Professor Jaana Vapaavuori from the School of Chemical Engineering.The small pores on the walls of the bigger walls constituted a hierarchically porous material. This specific structure could increase the tortuosity (i.e., the path the sound travels inside the material) of the material, which further increases sound absorption, especially at the high frequencies. This type of structure has not been reported before in the context of bio-based acoustic absorbers.\"The material has a structural hierarchy consisting of pores of different dimensions and scales. This type of structuring allowed optimizing the sound absorption performance of the material\u2014the sound can penetrate deep into material, and thus, the viscous and thermal losses in the materials are enhanced,\" says Professor Tapio Lokki from the School of Electrical Engineering.Collaboration with a local storeThe obvious benefit of collecting pectin from biowaste is that the researchers can make use of waste streams that are already being produced. The research team, led by professors Vapaavuori and Lokki are looking for opportunities to utilize locally-produced biowaste for their research.\"Now the work continues into an exploration of how raw material could be sourced directly from a local biowaste.

  "text": "Research in the International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design, has looked at the potential of various bioflavonoids as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The compounds\u2014narirutin, naringin, neohesperidin and hesperidin\u2014are found in citrus fruits. Their wide-ranging therapeutic and physiological effects are well known. The possibility of repurposing them in the face of the ongoing pandemic is discussed in light of computer modeling of their interaction with the virus' infamous spike protein.          The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters our cells by using a protein called S-protein to interact with a human protein called angiotensin converting enzyme 2, ACE2, present on the surface of our cells. Antiviral drugs that block this mechanism would effectively stop the virus in its tracks. However, finding safe, new antiviral agents is difficult, much better to test a well-known drug or compound and repurpose it for this disease.Pawan Gupta of the Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandals Institute of Pharmacy in Dhule, India, and colleagues have used a computer simulation of the systems to test whether various plant-derived molecules would dock with ACE2 and block entry of the virus. They have found that two of the four molecules tested, naringin and narirutin, can bind to both the S-protein/ACE2 interface and the active site of the S-protein. This means that these natural molecules have the potential to prevent the virus from entering human cells and so might be used to develop treatments for COVID-19.The COVID-19 pandemic has raged since early 2020, although the first of its victims were identified in China in late 2019. While preventative measures and vaccines have all been developed to help us cope with this emergent disease, there remains a need for treatments for those who do catch the potentially lethal disease. Repurposing could allow the rapid development and subsequent approval of antiviral agents given that many of the early-stage toxicity checks and safety trials will already have been undertaken for the use of such compounds in other health contexts.Of course, the current work was done on a computer, \"in silico,\" the next step will be to determine whether the two active, lead compounds can work in the laboratory, \"in vitro,\" and then \"in vivo\" in patients. The team also suggests that the kind of multi-targeting they have demonstrated so far in silico might be seen with other compounds, which could also be used as leads to novel antiviral compounds to tackle COVID-19.

  "answer_squad": " As ingredients are added",
  "text": "A small team of chemists at the Russian Academy of Sciences, has found that metal atoms, not nanoparticles, play the key role in catalysts used in fine organic synthesis. In the study, reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the group used multiple types of electron microscopy to track a region of a catalyst during a reaction to learn more about how it was proceeding.          Prior research has shown that there are two main methods for studying a reaction. The first is the most basic: As ingredients are added, the reaction is simply observed and/or measured. This can be facilitated through use of high-speed cameras. This approach will not work with nanoscale reactions, of course. In such cases, chemists use a second method: They attempt to capture the state of all the components before and after the reaction and then compare them to learn more about what happened.This second approach leaves much to be desired, however, as there is no way to prove that the objects under study correspond with one another. In recent years, chemists have been working on a new approach: Following the action of a single particle during the reaction. This new method has proven to have merit but it has limitations as well\u2014it also cannot be used for reactions that occur in the nanoworld. In this new effort, the researchers used multiple types of electron microscopy coupled with machine-learning algorithms.To test their ideas, the researchers used a carbon substrate with embedded palladium nanoparticles as a catalyst. By studying reactions using such a catalyst with several types of electron microscopes and then training machine learning algorithm with the results, they were able to track a region of the catalyst as it moved through a reaction. They were able to see that there were individual metal atoms as well as clusters in addition to the nanoparticles playing a role in the reaction. Further study showed that approximately 99% of catalytic activity was due to the palladium atoms, rather than the nanoparticles despite them making up just 1% of the palladium mass.

  "text": "When medical companies manufacture the pills and tablets that treat any number of illnesses, aches, and pains, they need to isolate the active pharmaceutical ingredient from a suspension and dry it. The process requires a human operator to monitor an industrial dryer, agitate the material, and watch for the compound to take on the right qualities for compressing into medicine. The job depends heavily on the operator's observations.          Methods for making that process less subjective and a lot more efficient are the subject of a recent Nature Communications paper authored by researchers at MIT and Takeda. The paper's authors devise a way to use physics and machine learning to categorize the rough surfaces that characterize particles in a mixture. The technique, which uses a physics-enhanced autocorrelation-based estimator (PEACE), could change pharmaceutical manufacturing processes for pills and powders, increasing efficiency and accuracy and resulting in fewer failed batches of pharmaceutical products.\"Failed batches or failed steps in the pharmaceutical process are very serious,\" says Allan Myerson, a professor of practice in the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering and one of the study's authors. \"Anything that improves the reliability of the pharmaceutical manufacturing, reduces time, and improves compliance is a big deal.\"The team's work is part of an ongoing collaboration between Takeda and MIT, launched in 2020. The MIT-Takeda Program aims to leverage the experience of both MIT and Takeda to solve problems at the intersection of medicine, artificial intelligence, and health care.In pharmaceutical manufacturing, determining whether a compound is adequately mixed and dried ordinarily requires stopping an industrial-sized dryer and taking samples off the manufacturing line for testing. Researchers at Takeda thought artificial intelligence could improve the task and reduce stoppages that slow down production.Originally the research team planned to use videos to train a computer model to replace a human operator. But determining which videos to use to train the model still proved too subjective. Instead, the MIT-Takeda team decided to illuminate particles with a laser during filtration and drying, and measure particle size distribution using physics and machine learning.\"We just shine a laser beam on top of this drying surface and observe,\" says Qihang Zhang, a doctoral student in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the study's first author.      A physics-derived equation describes the interaction between the laser and the mixture, while machine learning characterizes the particle sizes. The process doesn't require stopping and starting the process, which means the entire job is more secure and more efficient than standard operating procedure, according to George Barbastathis, professor of mechanical engineering at MIT and corresponding author of the study.The machine learning algorithm also does not require many datasets to learn its job, because the physics allows for speedy training of the neural network.Credit: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\"We utilize the physics to compensate for the lack of training data, so that we can train the neural network in an efficient way,\" says Zhang. \"Only a tiny amount of experimental data is enough to get a good result.\"Today, the only inline processes used for particle measurements in the pharmaceutical industry are for slurry products, where crystals float in a liquid. There is no method for measuring particles within a powder during mixing. Powders can be made from slurries, but when a liquid is filtered and dried its composition changes, requiring new measurements. In addition to making the process quicker and more efficient, using the PEACE mechanism makes the job safer because it requires less handling of potentially highly potent materials, the authors say.The ramifications for pharmaceutical manufacturing could be significant, allowing drug production to be more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective, by reducing the number of experiments companies need to conduct when making products. Monitoring the characteristics of a drying mixture is an issue the industry has long struggled with, according to Charles Papageorgiou, the director of Takeda's Process Chemistry Development group and one of the study's authors.\"It is a problem that a lot of people are trying to solve, and there isn't a good sensor out there,\" says Papageorgiou. \"This is a pretty big step change, I think, with respect to being able to monitor, in real time, particle size distribution.\"Papageorgiou said that the mechanism could have applications in other industrial pharmaceutical operations. At some point, the laser technology may be able to train video imaging, allowing manufacturers to use a camera for analysis rather than laser measurements. The company is now working to assess the tool on different compounds in its lab.The results come directly from collaboration between Takeda and three MIT departments: Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Over the last three years, researchers at MIT and Takeda have worked together on 19 projects focused on applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to problems in the health-care and medical industry as part of the MIT-Takeda Program.Often, it can take years for academic research to translate to industrial processes. But researchers are hopeful that direct collaboration could shorten that timeline. Takeda is a walking distance away from MIT's campus, which allowed researchers to set up tests in the company's lab, and real-time feedback from Takeda helped MIT researchers structure their research based on the company's equipment and operations.Combining the expertise and mission of both entities helps researchers ensure their experimental results will have real-world implications. The team has already filed for two patents and has plans to file for a third.

  "text": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be an ideal platform for detecting or extracting metal ions due to their different functional building units and large surface area.          However, most 3D COFs have interpenetration because of the existence of non-covalent interactions between the adjacent nets, which results in decreased surface areas and porosities and thus limits their applications in catalysis and molecular/gas adsorption.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Zeng Gaofeng and Assoc. Prof. Xu Qing from the Shanghai Advanced Research Institute (SARI) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has constructed a novel non-interpenetration 3D COF for Au ions capture by imine bonds in the frameworks. The high surface area and abundant cavities provided high Au3+ capacity (570.18 mg g-1), selectivity (99.5%) and efficiency (68.3% adsorption of maximum capacity in five mins).The study was published in Advanced Functional Materials on April 23.The synthesized BMTA-TFPM-COF displayed good crystallinity with dia topology and a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1,924 m2 g-1. Importantly, the open cavities and exposed C=N bonds from non-fold interpenetration contributed to high capacity, selectivity and stability of Au3+ uptake.The experiments showed the mechanism of Au capture. The protonated C=N bonds due to the influence of the HAuCl4 and the protonated nitrogenous groups could adsorb AuCl4- and reduce Au(III) to Au(I) and Au(0) in acidic solution. Thus, the BMTA-TFPM-COF with abundant exposed C=N bonds could promote the conversion from Au(III) to Au(I) and Au(0) through the protonated C=N bonds, which further verified that the C=N bonds could participate in the reduction of Au(III).This study provides new insights into the development of 3D COFs for Au3+ capture.

  "text": "Quantification of carbon isotopic composition (\u03b413C) of CO2 can trace the source of carbon, which is significant for studying the evolution process of geological fluids, constraining the global carbon budget, and clarifying the mechanism of biological metabolism.          At present, the commonly used isotope measurement technology (mass spectrometry) requires long-time sample pretreatment before testing, resulting in low detection efficiency. In addition, due to the limitation of testing conditions, it cannot be directly applied to in-situ detection in high-temperature and high-pressure environments.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Zhang Xin from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS) reported a rapid in-situ quantitative analysis method for determining the carbon isotopic composition of CO2 using Raman spectroscopy.The study was published in Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy on March 23.The researchers constructed a high-temperature and high-pressure experimental microsimulation device, based on confocal micro-Raman technology and capillary high-pressure optical cell (HPOC). They studied the Raman spectral characteristics of high-purity 13CO2, 12CO2, and their binary mixtures at high temperature and pressure (50\u2013450\u00b0C, 50\u2013400 bar).The results showed that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the characteristic peaks of 13CO2 and 12CO2 both were 2\u20135 cm-1, while the difference in peak position between them was more than 15 cm-1 in the experimental range of temperature and pressure, indicating that the 13CO2 and 12CO2 could be well distinguished by the peak position of characteristic peaks in Raman spectra.Furthermore, by studying the 13CO2\u201312CO2 binary mixtures with different proportions, the researchers discussed the relationship between the peak intensity ratio, and content ratio under different temperatures and pressures (corresponding to density). They selected the peak intensity ratio of 13CO2 to 12CO2 with a reference of the upper Raman characteristic peak (I+13/I+12) or the lower Raman characteristic peak (I-13/I-12) as quantitative indexes to respectively establish Raman quantitative calibration models, which can be used for the in-situ determination of carbon isotopic composition (13CO2/12CO2) of CO2 over a wide \u03b413C under high-temperature and high-pressure environments.\"The establishment of this Raman quantitative method provides an effective detection method for in-situ rapid monitoring of the carbon isotope composition of CO2 in high-temperature and high-pressure experiment system with isotope labeling,\" said Ge Yuzhou, first author of the study.\"With the further improvement in the accuracy and detection limits of the model, it is expected to be applied to in-situ measurement in natural systems with a very low 13CO2 content, such as the fluid inclusions and the deep-sea hydrothermal fluids,\" said Prof. Zhang, corresponding author of the study.

  "answer_squad": " PIDTa-EDOT",
  "text": "Thermoelectric materials, substances that convert temperature difference into electricity, find a multitude of applications involving the conversion of waste heat into useful electrical energy. However, they often need to rely on heavy rare earth elements for efficient thermoelectric conversion.          This, unfortunately, makes them expensive and environmentally hazardous. In recent years, conjugated polymer-based material has received attention as an environmentally benign alternative to the conventional rare earth metal-based thermoelectric materials.Owing to their high charge carrier mobility in the amorphous state, IDT-containing conductive polymers have the potential to reduce thermal conductivity while keeping their electronic conductivity intact. Unfortunately, these polymers suffer from low electronic conductivity, limiting our ability to synthesize high-performance thermoelectric materials from IDT-based polymers.A team of researchers led by Prof. Sukwon Hong Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in Korea have now found a solution to the problem. Equipped with their understanding of plausible reasons for the observed low conductivity, the team designed a novel strategy for developing an IDT-based polymer with improved thermoelectric performance based on dopant (impurity) position controlling within an acetal-functionalized IDT (IDTa) polymer. Their study was made available in Chemistry of Materials.The team chose PIDT-EDOT, a copolymer of IDT and then acetal-functionalized it to form PIDTa-EDOT. Next, they synthesized a Lewis-acid base complex by introducing nitrosyl hexafluorophosphate (NOPF6), a Lewis acidic dopant into the IDTa component. The addition of the acetal group was crucial, since it directed the dopant next to the benzylic position of the polymer skeleton, facilitating the desired dopant position control.\"We showed that the low conductivity of conventional IDT results from their non-polar side chains, which cause the dopant to be located between the polymer chains (backbone) instead of at the side chains. This, in turn, impedes charge transfer. Accordingly, we proposed a strategy that would allow us to place the dopant near the sidechains of the polymer backbone,\" explains Prof. Hong, when asked about the motivation behind the study.Upon testing the PIDTa-EDOT polymer, the researchers observed an improved doping efficiency, condensed \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking, and reduced grain size. These, in turn, imparted a low thermal conductivity of 0.09 W m\u22121 K\u22121 on one hand and 30 times higher electronic conductivity on the other. As a result, the PIDTa-EDOT polymer demonstrated a 6-fold improvement in thermoelectric performance compared to that of pristine PIDT-EDOT polymer.The study thus presents a new approach to synthesizing IDT-based polymers that simultaneously exhibit low thermal conductivity and high electronic conductivity, a prerequisite for developing efficient thermoelectric materials and thermoelectric conversion technology.\"Improved thermoelectric materials could lead to more efficient electricity generation from the waste heat released in industrial processes or even from the human body. This, in turn, could reduce energy consumption and make solar power more practical and cost-effective,\" concludes Prof. Hong.

  "text": "Materials made of spider silk can be specifically modified or processed in such a way that living cells of a certain type adhere to them, grow and proliferate. This has been discovered by researchers at the University of Bayreuth under the direction of Prof. Dr. Thomas Scheibel.          Cell-specific effects of the materials can be generated by biochemical modifications of the silk proteins, but also by surface structuring of spider silk coatings. The research findings, published in Advanced Healthcare Materials and Advanced Materials Interfaces, are pioneering for regenerative medicine and the production of artificial tissue.Spider silk promotes the formation of natural tissue in a cell-specific mannerIn many cases, biomedical restoration of damaged or destroyed tissue depends on stimulating and controlling the development of specific cells. Cells of different types, for example skin, muscle and nerve cells, must be involved in order to create a functioning cell network. A scaffold of spider silk implanted in the body, to which a growing number of newly developing cells attach, provides important prerequisites for this natural rebuilding process: Spider silk proteins are biodegradable and generally compatible with existing cells of the organism.The Bayreuth research results obtained at the Chair of Biomaterials now show how such a scaffold made of spider silk can be optimized. For spatially different sections of the scaffold, materials can be used in the future that are particularly well suited for the targeted attachment, growth and proliferation of cells of a required cell type.As a result, such a spider silk scaffold implanted in the body is ideally suited for the production of large natural tissue structures involving different cell types. It is gradually degraded in a natural way as the tissue regeneration progresses.Spider silk implant coatings suppress rejection reactionsThe results of the two studies will also benefit the optimization of implants that are intended to permanently replace natural tissue and remain in the body. This requires materials that ensure that the implants are not rejected by inflammation or allergic reactions.A coating of spider silk, which is optimally adapted to the respective cell types in the surrounding tissue and promotes their attachment, helps to avoid such rejection reactions and thus contributes to the smooth integration of the implant into the natural tissue.      Cell-specific effects through biochemical modificationsAs the Bayreuth researchers have demonstrated, cell-specific effects of spider silk materials can be produced by functionally modifying silk proteins through the incorporation of peptides, which are short-chain polyamino acids. Peptides that interact with cells (cell-adhesive peptides) are present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of natural tissues: This is a lattice-like molecular structure that fills the spaces between neighboring cells in a tissue and stabilizes their spatial arrangement.The Bayreuth researchers have grafted some cell-adhesive peptides found in the ECM of numerous organisms\u2014including humans\u2014into several variants of a silk protein derived from a spider silk of the garden cross spider. As a result of biochemical modification, some of these altered silk proteins were found to be generally cell-adhesive, while others generally exhibited cell-repellent behavior.In some cases, however, cell-specific interactions were observed in addition. Particularly striking were the effects of the peptide KGD: it specifically promotes the attachment and growth of myoblasts. These are embryonic muscle precursor cells that can develop into muscle fibers.\"Our research results point to a novel pathway leading to cell-specific applications of materials made from spider silk\u2014whether in the design of scaffolds to promote natural regenerative processes, in the coating of implants, or even in the 3D printing of hydrogels with encapsulated cells that can be further processed into functional materials,\" said Vanessa Trossmann M.Sc., lead author of the study published in Advanced Healthcare Materials.Cell-specific effects through surface structuring of spider silk coatingsThe study, published in Advanced Materials Interfaces, presents a different way to optimize spider silk materials. Coatings made from one silk protein derived directly from the silk of the garden spider do not exhibit cell-adhesive behavior on their own\u2014without biochemical modification.The research team led by Prof. Dr. Thomas Scheibel has now used a lithographic process to structure the surface of these coatings in such a way as to specifically stimulate the attachment and growth of cells of a certain type. The reactions of different cells to the shape and size of the geometric structures imprinted in the surface depend strongly on the respective cell type, among other parameters, as extensive tests have shown.\"Based on our research results, it will be possible to lithographically optimize coatings made of silk proteins or other biocompatible materials in such a way that they stimulate and drive the natural regeneration of complex tissue structures in a cell-specific manner,\" says Scheibel.

  "text": "Water isn't just a universal solvent that remains unaffected by its interactions. New publications from North Carolina State University show that water can change its solubility characteristics depending upon what it interacts with. Specifically, when water interacts with cellulose, it can stack in layered shells to control chemical reactions within, and physical properties of, the material. The work has implications for more sustainable and efficient design of cellulose-based products.          \"Cellulose is the world's most abundant biopolymer, and it's used in applications that range from bandages to electronics,\" says Lucian Lucia, professor of forest biomaterials and chemistry at NC State and corresponding author of a new study in Matter. \"But cellulose processing has been mostly done by trial and error, and some of it utilizes incredibly harsh chemicals. To find better ways to process cellulose, we need to understand its most fundamental interactions\u2014for example, with water.\"To do so, he worked with colleague Jim Martin, professor of chemistry at NC State, who studies the fundamental properties of water as a solvent.\"Water has the uncanny ability to change characteristics depending on what it's with, which gives it wide range of solubility characteristics,\" Martin says. Martin is the author of an opinion piece in Matter that is a companion to Lucia's study.\"We change the nature of water by what we dissolve in it, and by the concentrations of those solutes in water,\" Martin says. \"Think of the continuum between Kool-Aid and hard candy. You start with sugar. In Kool-Aid the sugar is completely dissolved. As you remove the water, you get taffy, then hard candy, then back to crystalline sugar.\"\"We know that water is critical to how cellulose is laid down,\" Lucia says. \"So in this study we probed how it orients itself and plays a reactive role in mitigating or leveraging chemistry.\"The researchers physically manipulated different types of wood fibers and looked at how water bound to itself and other molecules within the resulting structures. They saw that at lower water contents, the water distribution and resulting molecular interactions between the water and the fibers create bridging structures within the material that cause it to lose flexibility.In fact, they saw that the water can \"hide\" itself within the cellulose network, forming strong hydrogen bonds. This bonding in turn dictates the tightness or looseness of the bridging structures.\"The water forms shells around the fibers that can stack, like a nesting Russian doll,\" Martin says. \"The fewer shells, or layers, the harder the fibers. But when you add more layers, the connection between fibers grows farther away and the material becomes softer.\"The researchers hope to explore the variety of bonds water forms within these structures in future work.\"Studying these interactions at the molecular level paves the way toward manipulating water in cellulose to design better products and processes,\" Lucian says. \"Understanding what is happening from fundamental principles lets us design approaches that take advantage of water's properties for everything from drug delivery to designing electronics.\"The research paper, \"Computational and experimental insights into the molecular architecture of water-cellulose networks,\" and the editorial piece, \"Water under the influence of solutes: on the non-innocence of a universal solvent,\" both appear in Matter.

  "text": "The need to capture CO2 and transport it for permanent storage or conversion into valued end uses is a national priority recently identified in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to move toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.          Now, Northwestern University researchers have worked with an international team of collaborators to create acetic acid out of carbon monoxide derived from captured carbon. The innovation, which uses a novel catalyst created in the lab of professor Ted Sargent, could spur new interest in carbon capture and storage.\"Carbon capture is feasible today from a technical point of view, but not yet from an economic point of view,\" Sargent said. \"By using electrochemistry to convert captured carbon into products with established markets, we provide new pathways to improving these economics, as well as a more sustainable source for the industrial chemicals that we still need.\"The paper was published in the journal Nature.Sargent, the paper's corresponding author, is Northwestern's Lynn Hopton Davis and Greg Davis Professor of Chemistry at the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering. His team has a track record of using electrolyzers\u2014devices in which electricity drives a desired chemical reaction forward\u2014to convert captured carbon into key industrial chemicals, including ethylene and propanol.Though acetic acid may be most familiar as the key component in household vinegar, recent University of Toronto Ph.D. recipient Josh Wicks, one of the paper's four co-lead authors, said this use accounts for only a small proportion of what it's used for.\"Acetic acid in vinegar needs to come from biological sources via fermentation because it's consumed by humans,\" Wicks said. \"But about 90% of the acetic acid market is for feedstock in the manufacture of paints, coatings, adhesives and other products. Production at this scale is primarily derived from methanol, which comes from fossil fuels.\"Lifecycle assessment databases showed the team that for every kilogram of acetic acid produced from methanol, the process releases 1.6 kg of CO2.      Their alternative method takes place via a two-step process: first, captured gaseous CO2 is passed through an electrolyzer, where it reacts with water and electrons to form carbon monoxide (CO). Gaseous CO is then passed through a second electrolyzer, where another catalyst transforms it into various molecules containing two or more carbon atoms.\"A major challenge that we face is selectivity,\" Wicks said. \"Most of the catalysts used for this second step facilitate multiple simultaneous reactions, which leads to a mix of different two-carbon products that can be hard to separate and purify. What we tried to do here was set up conditions that favor one product above all others.\"Vinayak Dravid, another senior author on the paper and the Abraham Harris Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, is the founding director of the Northwestern University Atomic and Nanoscale Characterization (NUANCE) Center, which allowed the team to access diverse capabilities for atomic- and electronic-scale measurements of materials.\"Modern research problems are complex and multifaceted and require diverse yet integrated capabilities to analyze materials down to the atomic scale,\" Dravid said. \"Colleagues like Ted present us with challenging problems that stimulate our creativity to develop novel ideas and innovative characterization methods.\"The team's analysis showed that using a much lower proportion of copper (approximately 1%) compared with previous catalysts would favor the production of just acetic acid. It also showed that elevating the pressure to 10 atmospheres would enable the team to achieve record-breaking efficiency.In the paper, the team reports a faradic efficiency of 91%, meaning that 91 out of every 100 electrons pumped into the electrolyzers end up in the desired product\u2014in this case, acetic acid.\"That's the highest faradic efficiency for any multi-carbon product at a scalable current density we've seen reported,\" Wicks said. \"For example, catalysts targeting ethylene typically max out around 70% to 80%, so we're significantly higher than that.\"The new catalyst also appears to be relatively stable: while the faradic efficiency of some catalysts tend to degrade over time, the team showed that it remained at a high level of 85% even after 820 hours of operation.Wicks hopes that the elements that led to the team's success\u2014including a novel target product, a slightly increased reaction pressure, and a lower proportion of copper in the catalyst\u2014inspire other teams to think outside the box.\"Some of these approaches go against the conventional wisdom in this field, but we showed that they can work really well,\" he said. \"At some point, we're going to have to decarbonize all the elements of chemical industry, so the more different pathways we have to useful products, whether it's ethanol, propylene or acetic acid, the better.\" More information:Edward Sargent, Constrained C2 adsorbate orientation enables CO-to-acetate electroreduction, Nature (2023).

  "text": "A team of chemists at the University of California, Los Angeles has found that the benzene isomer 1,2,3-cyclohexatriene has the potential to be a versatile reagent in organic synthesis. In their study, reported in the journal Nature, Andrew Kelleghan, Ana Bulger, Dominick Witkowski and Neil Garg conducted experiments with the high-energy compound.          For many years, 1,2,3-cyclohexatriene has been virtually ignored as a useful reagent for use in organic synthesis\u2014it has been considered to be too unstable to be of use. Still, it is promising because it is substantially higher in energy than benzene.Also, isomers of benzene in general have long been of interest to organic chemists because of their potential for synthesizing useful organic materials. In this new effort, the researchers believed that under the right conditions, the isomer 1,2,3-cyclohexatriene could prove to be useful as a reagent for producing a wide range of organic compounds.The team first set about producing samples using a method developed in the 1990s to generate intermediates from a precursor. They then used a variety of techniques to produce an array of fused-ring adducts, all of which were likely to react well, like benzenes, to nucleophiles. They then set to work using the resulting material to determine whether it could be used as an effective reagent.To test the possibility of using it as electrophilic reagent, the team conducted a host of trapping reactions with dimethyl trienes. Then also used sily1 group members to show how nucleophilic reactions could be conducted and also conducted reactions showing the potential of \u03c3-bond insertions. The group also conducted computational studies in conjunction with experimental analysis that showed that derivatives of 1,2,3-cyclohexatriene could be used in certain reactions despite the high degree of reactivity and its limited lifetime.The team also showed that 1,2,3-cyclohexatrienes could be used in synthetic sequences that involve many steps, which, they note, shows their utility in building stereochemically and topologically complex molecules. They conclude that such isomers and their derivatives merit further investigation for use in creating organic materials. More information:Andrew V.

  "text": "An article published in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering brings good news for coffee buffs: the plastic in used coffee pods can be recycled to make filament for 3D printers, minimizing its environmental impact.          The solution was successfully tested by research groups in Brazil at the Federal University of S\u00e3o Carlos (USFCar) and the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), and in the United Kingdom at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU).\"We produced new conductive and non-conductive filaments from waste polylactic acid [PLA] from used coffee machine pods. There are many applications for these filaments, including conductive parts for machinery and sensors,\" Bruno Campos Janegitz, a co-author of the article, told Ag\u00eancia FAPESP. Janegitz heads the Sensors, Nanomedicine and Nanostructured Materials Laboratory (LSNano) at UFSCar in Araras, S\u00e3o Paulo state.Brazil is the world's leading producer and exporter of coffee, as well as its second-largest consumer after the United States. Although most coffee consumed in Brazil is low-quality (Coffea canephora, also known as robusta coffee, with a high proportion of defects and impurities disguised by high roasting of beans and plenty of sugar or sweetener in the cup), demand for gourmet and specialty coffees is steadily growing.Comprising selected arabica beans (Coffea arabica) with a lower roast to preserve their natural sugars, aroma and flavor, gourmet coffees score 75-80 on the scale used by the Brazilian Coffee Industry Association (ABIC), which goes from 0 to 100. Specialty coffees must also have what is called a socio-environmental certification and score at least 80 on the scale used by the Brazilian Specialty Coffee Association (BSCA).The quality of the beverage also depends on how it is prepared, and many Brazilians have begun to use the cafeti\u00e8re (also known as French press) or stove-top Moka pot (caffettiera in Italian) instead of the traditional cloth or paper filter. Portable electric espresso machines that use pods are also increasingly popular, albeit far more expensive. The problem with the latter is what to do with used pods.Although reusable pods exist and some suppliers promote recycling of aluminum pods, most consumers just throw used pods into the garbage bin, especially if they are made of plastic. Considering all the factors involved, calculations made by the S\u00e3o Paulo State Technological Research Institute (IPT) show that \"a cup of pod coffee can be as much as 14 times more damaging to the environment than a cup of filter coffee.\"To develop uses for this waste, the researchers produced electrochemical cells with non-conductive filaments of PLA and electrochemical sensors with conductive filaments prepared by adding carbon black to the PLA. Carbon black is a paracrystalline form of carbon that results from incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. \"The electrochemical sensors were used to determine the proportion of caffeine in black tea and arabica coffee,\" Janegitz explained.Production of filament is relatively simple, he added. \"We obtain the non-conductive material simply by washing and drying PLA pods, followed by hot extrusion. To obtain the conductive material, we add carbon black before heating and extrusion. The extruded material is then cooled and spooled to produce the filament of interest,\" he explained.The process is a good example of the circular economy, in which the waste produced by an economic activity is not treated as a problem that harms the environment but converted into resources to implement another activity. \"The polymer base obtained from used pods can generate devices with a great deal of added value,\" Janegitz said.

  "text": "Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in shaping and sustaining life on Earth, yet many aspects of the process remain a mystery. One such mystery is how photosystem II, a protein complex in plants, algae and cyanobacteria, harvests energy from sunlight and uses it to split water, producing the oxygen we breathe. Now researchers from the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, together with collaborators from Uppsala University and Humboldt University and other institutions have succeeded in cracking a key secret of photosystem II.       Using SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and the SPring-8 Angstrom Compact free electron LAser (SACLA) in Japan, they captured for the first time in atomic detail what happens in the final moments leading up to the release of breathable oxygen. The data reveal an intermediate reaction step that had not been observed before.The results, published today in Nature, shed light on how nature has optimized photosynthesis. The finding will help scientists develop artificial photosynthetic systems that mimic photosynthesis to harvest natural sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into hydrogen and carbon based-fuels.The machinery responsible for photosynthesis\u2014while commonplace and essential to life on Earth\u2014is still not fully understood. One of its molecular mysteries involves how a protein complex, photosystem II, harvests energy from light and uses it to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. This video explains how, in a previous paper, researchers were able to see two key steps in photosynthetic water splitting under conditions as it occurs in nature, a big step to decoding how the process works in detail. Credit: Chris Smith/SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\"The more we learn about how nature does it, the closer we get to using those same principles in human-made processes, including ideas for artificial photosynthesis as a clean and sustainable energy source,\" said co-author Jan Kern, a scientist at Berkeley Lab.Co-author Junko Yano, also at Berkeley Lab, said, \"Photosystem II is giving us the blueprint for how to optimize our clean energy sources and avoid dead ends and dangerous side products that damage the system. What we once thought was just fundamental science could become a promising avenue to improving our energy technologies.\"Bases loadedDuring photosynthesis, photosystem II's oxygen-evolving center\u2014a cluster of four manganese atoms and one calcium atom connected by oxygen atoms\u2014facilitates a series of challenging chemical reactions that act to split apart a water molecule to release molecular oxygen.The center cycles through four stable oxidation states, known as S0 through S3, when exposed to sunlight. On a baseball field, S0 would be the start of the game when a player on home base is ready to go to bat. S1\u2013S3 would be players on first, second, and third. Every time a batter connects with a ball, or the complex absorbs a photon of sunlight, the player on the field advances one base. When the fourth ball is hit, the player slides into home, scoring a run or, in the case of photosystem II, releasing one molecule of breathable oxygen.In their experiments, the researchers probed this center by exciting samples from cyanobacteria with optical light and then probing them with ultrafast X-ray pulses from LCLS and SACLA. The data revealed the atomic structure of the cluster and the chemical process around it.      A homerunUsing this technique, the scientists for the first time imaged the mad dash for home\u2014the transient state, or S4, where two atoms of oxygen bond together and an oxygen molecule is released. The data showed that there are additional steps in this reaction that had never been seen before.\"Other experts argued that this is something that could never be captured,\" said co-author Uwe Bergmann, a scientist and professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"It's really going to change the way we think about photosystem II. Although we can't say we have a unique mechanism based on the data yet, we can exclude some models and ideas people have proposed over the last few decades. It's the closest anyone has ever come to capturing this final step and showing how this process works with actual structural data.\"In photosystem II, the water-splitting center cycles through four stable states, S0\u2013S3. On a baseball field, S0 would be the start of the game when a batter on home base is ready to hit. S1\u2013S3 would be players waiting on first, second, and third. The center gets bumped up to the next state every time it absorbs a photon of sunlight, just like how a player on the field advances one base every time a batter connects with a ball. When the fourth ball is hit, the player slides into home, scoring a run or, in the case of photosystem II, releasing the oxygen we breathe. Credit: Greg Stewart/SLAC National Accelerator LaboratoryThe new study is the latest in a series undertaken by the team over the past decade. Earlier work focused on observing various steps of the photosynthetic cycle at the temperature at which it occurs in nature.\"Most of the process that produces breathable oxygen happens in this last step,\" said co-author Vittal Yachandra, a scientist at Berkeley Lab. \"But there are several things happening at different parts of photosystem II and they all have to come together in the end for the reaction to succeed. Just like how in baseball, factors like the location of the ball and the position of the basemen and fielders affect the moves a player takes to get to home base, the protein environment around the catalytic center influences how this reaction plays out.\"Brighter X-rays for a brighter futureBased on these results, the researchers plan to conduct experiments designed to capture many more snapshots of the process.\"There are still things happening in between that we could not catch yet,\" Kern said. \"There are more snapshots we really want to take which would bridge the remaining gaps and tell the whole story.\"To do so, they need to push the quality of their data even further. In the past, these types of measurements proved challenging because the X-ray signals from the samples are faint and the rates at which existing X-ray lasers like LCLS and SACLA produce X-ray pulses are too small.\"It took quite some effort to optimize the setup, so we couldn't collect all the data we needed for this one publication in a single experiment,\" said co-author and SLAC scientist Roberto Alonso-Mori. \"These results actually include data taken over six years.\"When an LCLS upgrade, called LCLS-II, comes online later this year, the repetition rate will skyrocket from 120 pulses per second to up to a million per second.\"With these upgrades, we will be able to collect several days' worth of data in just a few hours,\" Bergmann said. \"We will also be able to use soft X-rays to further understand the chemical changes happening in the system. These new capabilities will continue to drive this research forward and shed new light on photosynthesis.\" More information:Junko Yano, Structural evidence for intermediates during O2 formation in photosystem II, Nature (2023).

  "answer_squad": " electroroadhesion",
  "text": "If you're a fan of arts and crafts, you're likely familiar with the messy, sticky, frustration-inducing nature of liquid glues. But researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces now have a brand-new way to weld squishy stuff together without the need for glue at all. They've demonstrated a universal, \"electroadhesion\" technique that can adhere soft materials to each other just by running electricity through them.          There's a glue out there for almost any situation, whether it involves plastic, fabric, wood or beyond. But things get a bit tricky when materials are soft and squishy, like tissues or engineered organs. Strategies including 3D-printing avoid glues altogether by fusing together an entire structure\u2014such as an organ\u2014all at once.But this can be slow and laborious, and require advanced technical equipment. Another alternative could be electroadhesion, in which an electric field is used to hold oppositely charged materials together, forming attachments between the materials' components. This can involve chemical bonds, like ionic bonds, or more physical connections, like ensnaring polymer chains together.Plus, it works with little more than a household battery and pencil lead. Previously, Srinivasa Raghavan and colleagues showed that electroadhesion could reversibly hold a gel to a tissue without the need for sutures. But now, they wanted to see if the technique could work for any two materials, given that they had opposite charges, to precisely and reversibly hold them together.To explore the phenomenon, the team tested a gel in addition to three types of capsules made of alginate or chitosan\u2014both naturally occurring polymers\u2014that were either positively or negatively charged. When attached to graphite electrodes and exposed to a 10-V electric field for around 10 seconds, the oppositely charged materials stuck together.This bond was strong enough to withstand gravity, and evidence from previous experiments suggests it could last for years. By reversing the flow of electricity, however, the bond was easily broken. The team assembled chains and even 3D cubes out of individual, spherical capsules.The researchers also used electroadhesion to sort capsules by their charges, either by laying a charged gel on top of several capsules, or by touching them with a fingertip \"robot\" that adhered the capsules to themselves. The researchers say that this work demonstrates the universality of electroadhesion and could one day be used in robotics and tissue engineering. More information:Leah K.

  "text": "A team of international researchers led by Professor Cafer T. Yavuz of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Prof. Bo Liu from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and Prof. Qiang Xu of Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) have developed a promising method for carbon capture and storage.          Methane hydrate is studied for its ability to capture and trap gas molecules such as carbon dioxide under high pressure. However, it is difficult to impossible to recreate these conditions in the lab, and the approach is additionally energy intensive, as the methane-ice solid requires refrigeration. Using a salt\u2014guanidinium sulfate\u2014the scientists have successfully created lattice-like structures called clathrates that effectively mimic the methane hydrate activity, trapping the CO2 molecules and resulting in an energy efficient way to contain the greenhouse gas.\"The guanidinium sulfate serves to organize and trap the CO2 molecules without reacting with them,\" said Cafer Yavuz, professor of chemistry, and director of the KAUST Oxide and Organic Nanomaterials for Energy & Environment (ONE) Laboratory. \"We have discovered a rare example of a clathrate that is stable and non-corrosive at ambient temperature and pressure, a highly desirable feature compared with ethanol amine, ammonia and other solutions that are commonly used in carbon capture.\"Previous carbon capture methods included chemisorption, where chemical bonds form between CO2 molecules and the surface. This process worked well; however, the chemical bonds require energy to break them down, which drives up the cost of the CO2 capture operation. The salt-based, clathrate structure utilizes low energy, physisorption processes while capturing CO2 without water or nitrogen interference, opening a promising venue for future carbon capture and storage technologies through rapid CO2 solidification.The discovery introduces a new way of storing and transporting carbon dioxide as a solid. CO2 is conventionally carried as a solid in the form of dry ice; compressed in gas cylinders; or in the form of carbonates. The salt clathrate allows CO2 to be carried as a solid powder, yielding remarkably high volume per weight capacity, making this method the least energy intensive, with tremendous potential for real life applications.\"Our team made it possible to carry CO2 in a solid form without the need for refrigeration or pressure. You will be able to literally shovel CO2 loaded solids from now on,\" he said. \"The impact is wide and strong, as the global fuel industry and the Kingdom entities are actively looking for ways to capture, store and transport CO2 without significant energy penalties.\"The method could have a significant impact on the fight against climate change, enabling energy-efficient carbon capture and storage. The research team is optimistic that their findings will lead to further improvements in CO2 capture in terms of stability, recyclability, sorption capacity and selectivity, and lowering regeneration energy penalty and cost.The research was carried out at Southern University of Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.

  "answer_squad": " HYDR.O. Geologen und Ingenieure GbR",
  "text": "Harmful PFAS chemicals can now be detected in many soils and bodies of water. Removing them using conventional filter techniques is costly and almost infeasible. Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB are now successfully implementing a plasma-based technology in the AtWaPlas joint research project.          Contaminated water is fed into a combined glass and stainless steel cylinder where it is then treated with ionized gas, i.e., plasma. This reduces the PFAS molecular chains, allowing the toxic substance to be removed at a low cost.Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have many special properties. As they are thermally and chemically stable as well as resistant to water, grease and dirt, they can be found in a large number of everyday products: Pizza boxes and baking paper are coated with them, for example, and shampoos and creams also contain PFAS. In industry they serve as extinguishing and wetting agents, and in agriculture they are used in plant protection products.However, traces of PFAS are now also being detected where they should not be found: in soil, rivers and groundwater, in food and in drinking water. This is how the harmful substances end up in the human body. Due to their chemical stability, eliminating these so-called \"forever chemicals\" has been almost impossible up to now without considerable effort and expense.The AtWaPlas joint research project aims to change that. The acronym stands for Atmospheric Water Plasma Treatment. The innovative project is currently being run at the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB in Stuttgart in cooperation with the industrial partner HYDR.O. Geologen und Ingenieure GbR from Aachen. The aim is to treat and recover PFAS-contaminated water using plasma treatment.The research team led by Dr. Georg Umlauf, an expert in functional surfaces and materials, utilizes plasma's ability to attack the molecular chains of substances. The electrically conductive gas consisting of electrons and ions is generated when high voltage is applied. \"Our experiments with plasma have been successful in shortening the PFAS molecule chains in water. This is a significant step towards efficiently removing these stubborn pollutants,\" Umlauf is happy to report.                Plasma reactor: Plasma is created by applying voltage to the copper electrode. Contaminated water is pumped upwards and flows back down through a gap in the plasma discharge zone, attacking the PFAS in the process. Credit: Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft             Water cycle in a stainless steel cylinderFraunhofer researchers are using a cylindrical construction for this plasma process. Inside is a stainless steel tube, which serves as the ground electrode of the electrical circuit. The outer copper mesh then acts as a high-voltage electrode and is protected on the inside by a glass dielectric. A very small gap is left between the two, which is filled with an air mixture. This air mixture is converted into plasma when a voltage of several kilovolts is applied. It is visible to the human eye by its characteristic glow and discharge as flashes of light.During the purification process, the PFAS-contaminated water is introduced at the bottom of the stainless steel tank and pumped upwards. It then travels down through the gap between the electrodes, passing through the electrically active plasma atmosphere. The plasma breaks up and shortens the PFAS molecule chains as it discharges.The water is repeatedly pumped through both the steel reactor and the plasma discharge zone in a closed circuit, reducing the PFAS molecule chains further each time until they are completely mineralized. \"Ideally, the harmful PFAS substances are eliminated to the point that they can no longer be detected in mass spectrometric measurements. This also complies with the strict German Drinking Water Ordinance (TrinkwV) regulations regarding PFAS concentrations,\" says Umlauf.The technology developed at the Fraunhofer Institute has a key advantage over conventional methods such as active carbon filtering: \"Active carbon filters can bind the harmful substances, but they are unable to eliminate them. This means that the filters must be replaced and disposed of regularly. The AtWaPlas technology, on the other hand, is capable of completely eliminating the harmful substances without any residue and is very efficient and low-maintenance,\" explains Fraunhofer expert Umlauf.                Pilot plant for the elimination of PFAS. Following the initial success of the trials, the technology is now to be optimized and scaled up for practical applications on an industrial scale. Credit: Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft             Real water samples instead of synthetic laboratory samplesIn order to ensure true feasibility, the Fraunhofer researchers are testing the plasma purification under more challenging conditions. Conventional test methods involve using perfectly clean water and PFAS solutions that have been synthetically mixed in the laboratory. However, the research team in Stuttgart is using \"real\" water samples that come from PFAS-contaminated areas.The samples are collected by the project partner HYDR.O. Geologen und Ingenieure GbR from Aachen. The company specializes in cleaning up contaminated sites and also carries out hydrodynamic simulations.The real water samples that Umlauf and his team work with therefore contain PFAS as well as other particles, suspended solids and organic turbidity. \"This is how we verify the purification efficiency of AtWaPlas, not only using synthetic laboratory samples, but also under real conditions with changing water qualities. The process parameters can be adapted and further developed at the same time,\" explains Umlauf.This plasma method can also be used to break down other harmful substances, including pharmaceutical residues in wastewater, pesticides and herbicides, but also industrial chemicals such as cyanides. AtWaPlas can also be used to treat drinking water in mobile applications in an environmentally friendly and cost-effective way.The AtWaPlas joint research project launched in JuIy 2021. After a successful series of pilot-scale tests with a 5 liter reactor, the Fraunhofer team is now working with the joint research partner to further optimize the process.Georg Umlauf states, \"Our current objective is to completely eliminate toxic PFAS by extending process times and increasing the number of circulations in the tank. We also want to make the AtWaPlas technology available for practical application on a larger scale.\" The future could see corresponding plants set up as standalone purification stages in sewage treatment plants or used in portable containers on contaminated open-air sites.

  "answer_squad": " Psilocybe semilanceata",
  "text": "Psilocybin is a hallucinogenic compound found in about 200 mushroom species, including the liberty cap (Psilocybe semilanceata). For millennia, our ancestors have known and used this substance, and in recent years, it has received renewed interest from scientific researchers and therapists.          The substance has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat conditions such as severe depression and substance addiction, according to many. This is also the opinion of University of Southern Denmark researchers Himanshu Khandelia and Ali Asghar Hakami Zanjani from the Department of Physics, Chemistry and Pharmacy.The two researchers have recently published their paper, titled \"The Molecular Basis of the Antidepressant Action of the Magic Mushroom extract, Psilocin.\" The article is the third in a series on the same topic from the two researchers (Interaction of psychedelic tryptamine derivatives with a lipid bilayer and Magic mushroom extracts in lipid membranes). The newest study's co-authors are Teresa Quynh Tram Nguyen and Luise Jacobsen.\"My interest was piqued when I heard a podcast about treating smoking addiction with psilocybin. And since psilocybin mushrooms grow everywhere in Denmark\u2014I picked some in Svanninge Bakker\u2014it wasn't difficult to start our research,\" said Himanshu Khandelia.Together with Ali Asghar Hakami Zanjani, he is interested in understanding what happens at the molecular level when psilocybin enters the body, is converted to psilocin, and reaches the brain.\"Previous research has shown that psilocin binds to serotonin receptors in the brain. We show that psilocin binds stronger than serotonin to a 5-HT2AR serotonin receptor. This knowledge can be used if you want to design a drug that acts like psilocybin,\" explained Ali Asghar Hakami Zanjani.The two researchers are neither neuroscientists nor pharmacists, so they currently have no plans on conducting clinical trials or designing new drugs. Their research is about studying and describing what happens at the molecular level when psilocin meets a brain cell, penetrates its membrane, and binds to receptors.      \"I would be very happy if society can use our research. Maybe someone will take this further and create a molecule that can be used in medical treatment for conditions like depression,\" says Himanshu Khandelia.Zanjani and Khandelia plan to continue their research in this area, and are now investigating the mechanism by which the binding of the compounds to the receptor triggers psycho-active responses.The time is more favorable than it has been in a long time for researchers who want to explore psilocybin treatments for conditions such as depression, addiction, anorexia, and PTSD.Since the 1960s, many countries' health authorities have had strict bans on researching hallucinogenic substances like psilocybin and LSD.Prior to that, Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman had isolated psilocybin and psilocin from the P. mexicana mushroom in 1959, and the pharmaceutical company he worked for marketed and sold pure psilocybin to doctors and therapists who could then treat their patients with it.Towards the end of the 1960s, many countries, especially the United States, tightened their legislation on psychoactive substances, and this also affected research on psilocybin and similar substances, which has been largely stagnant since the 1960s until a few years ago.Today, countries like the United States, England, and Denmark are again active in the research field\u2014now with a more cautious approach.Hallucinations and the feeling of being disconnected from the world will come along whether one eats a psilocybin mushroom to take a trip or one takes the substance in a medically prescribed tablet, and this calls for caution, explains Ali Asghar Hakami Zanjani:\"Research shows that you experience something different. It is a form of hallucination. The characteristic is that patients may get a whole new perspective on their situation: for example, a terminally ill cancer patient may lose their fear of dying soon and instead experience acceptance of their life situation. Such sessions should take place in safe and guiding settings led by trained therapists. Today, no one would recommend just eating some mushrooms at home in their own living room.\"The paper is published in the journal Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)\u2014Proteins and Proteomics.

Until recently, many of them were at risk from an invisible attacker: acetic acid released by their aging wooden picture frames.Chemists based in another renowned Italian city, Florence, have come up with a new material that will protect the artworks from acetic acid, formaldehyde and other damaging volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for between 50 and 100 years.Clever and cheap\"We synthesized the first absorber for acetic acid and formaldehyde using a very clever, cheap method,\" said Piero Baglioni, professor of physical chemistry at the Center for Colloid and Surface Science, or CSGI, in the University of Florence.The material is flexible and biodegradable and can absorb twice its weight in pollutants. It's made mainly from castor oil.Curators at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection have applied sheets of it to the backs of paintings and on a wall in one room, which includes a 1929 painting by Vasily Kandinsky and a 1915 sculpture by Umberto Boccioni.Levels of acetic acid in the room have since dropped from two parts per million (ppm), which is high enough to damage artwork, to safe levels of 0.5 ppm, according to Baglioni.The material, Nanorestore VOCs, can be produced in any shape, size and color, said Baglioni, who coordinated a research project called APACHE that developed a range of products designed to protect valuable artworks.The discovery is likely to have a major impact on the future health of artworks, including those in storage. That's because many galleries and museums store their collections in wooden containers, which release VOCs.The Pompidou Center in Paris\u2014home to Europe's largest collection of modern and contemporary art\u2014is testing the material for its storage containers. The museum keeps most of its 120,000 pieces in wooden crates, including works by Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Georges Braque.      Scream testBaglioni is also testing the material in the Oslo, Norway-based museum dedicated to Edvard Munch and featuring one of the artist's most famous paintings\u2014The Scream. Hundreds of Munch's prints and drawings are kept in wooden drawers that would cost a small fortune to change to a new material, according to Baglioni.In February, following APACHE's end last year, his team put sheets of the material\u2014costing about \u20ac5 each\u2014in the storage drawers and will check the VOC levels in June.\"If it works, the museum will save a lot of money,\" Baglioni said.The product will soon be on the market for museums and galleries. It's also being marketed as a way to purify the air in homes, hospitals and offices. VOCs comprise 80% of indoor air pollutants and can affect people's health.Baglioni is working with researchers at Sweden's Chalmers University to produce what they hope will be the world's most effective and environmentally friendly material for absorbing VOCs.APACHE also developed sensors that cost just \u20ac0.10 each to monitor levels of VOCs. These will be made by Goppion, an Italian company that produces display cases used by the Louvre and other cultural institutions.But the company, which took part in the project, needs broader demand for production to be viable.\"If the market for this system is restricted to museums and galleries, it won't be profitable,\" said Baglioni. \"So we have to find an additional use for them.\"Invisible threatsMost threats to Europe's masterpieces and historical artifacts are invisible to the naked eye: changes in temperature or humidity, ultraviolet light, small vibrations from the footfall of visitors or building works as well as VOCs.Even the type of building that the works are housed in\u2014modern or old, stone or wooden\u2014affects them. Often, the impacts become visible only once the damage is done.Whereas large museums and art galleries can pay for multiple sensors to monitor closely their collections, cash-strapped smaller institutions struggle to meet international standards on maintenance and storage.\"It's really hard for small and medium-sized museums to preserve their artifacts because of a lack of expertise, human resources and means,\" said Marie-Dominique Bruni, program manager at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, also known as CEA.Bruni coordinated a project called SensMat that developed sensors and software to monitor as many as 12 different environmental factors\u2014from dust levels to vibrations\u2014and alert conservators to the risks to art in their care so they can act before damage occurs.\"We facilitate the way they collect and interpret this data to decide the best way to display an exhibit, or what to change if its environment puts it at risk of damage,\" said Bruni.That may mean changing the climate controls, limiting the number of visitors or moving the item to another room.Metal objects, for example, can corrode in the wrong temperature, humidity and light conditions.\"When that corrosion becomes visible, it's too late,\" said Bruni. \"So we have to move the objects or change the temperature and humidity to prevent their corrosion.\"One of the most detrimental effects is low-frequency vibration. These could come not just from visitors' footfall and building works but also auto traffic.\"Museums need to diagnose the impact of vibrations,\" said Bruni. \"Frescoes painted on walls or ceilings and objects made with different layers are particularly vulnerable.\"Software successMuseums and galleries increasingly lend collections to each other, a practice that creates new challenges for the transport and display of objects.\"Museums and galleries have to guarantee they won't endanger the objects they are receiving,\" said Bruni. \"Our software could help them define the conditions needed before receiving new objects. Insurance companies are very interested in this kind of information.\"SensMat, which ran from January 2019 through August 2022, worked with museums in seven European countries including Denmark, France, Germany and Italy.\"It was really important to have studies in different climates and different locations,\" said Bruni.This meant being able to develop solutions suited to a wide range of scenarios. The SensMat team hopes its findings will be used to help update international recommendations on how to display and preserve objects.Today Bruni is trying to find investors in order to complete the last stage of development and put the software on the market.Large museums have expressed interest in the software, but making it affordable for small galleries is the ultimate goal.\"We've received lots of demand for the software,\" Bruni said. \"We just need to develop it a little bit more.

  "text": "A method to store advanced cell models has been developed by researchers at the University of Warwick.          The technology, which was shared in the journal JACS Au, could improve the cryopreservation of cells, tissue culture and 3D cells models used variety of applications, including research, medical therapies and agriculture.Cryopreservation is the process of freezing cells at very low temperatures to preserve them for later use. However, when cells are frozen, ice can form inside the cells, which can damage or kill them. This is a particular problem for 2D and 3D cellular models, which replicate some of the properties of organs and have complex structures that make it difficult for cryoprotectants to reach all their constituent cells.The new method developed by the researchers at the University of Warwick uses soluble ice nucleating polysaccharides (a type of molecule that interacts with ice) produced by tree pollens to ensure ice forms outside of cells. This helps prevent the formation of damaging ice in cell interiors. The method was tested on a variety of 2D and 3D tissue models and was found to be effective in reducing intracellular ice formation and improving cell viability.The work has particular importance because of a recent decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, removing the requirement to test new drugs on animals and expanding the need for methods for storing and transporting organ-like cell models.Dr. Thomas Whale, Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick, said, \"Cryopreservation is essential across all biomedical research and drug discovery. Most people assume cryopreservation is focused on stopping ice forming, but it is actually essential to help ice form, at the highest temperature possible. We achieved this, and show that by helping the ice form we can dramatically improve the recovery of these cells.\"Professor Matthew Gibson, Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, added, \"This innovative work has been inspired by nature, which has evolved elegant solutions to control exactly when, and where ice forms. Our discovery shows that we can store complex cell models in a freezer, so they are 'ready to use,' to advance basic biomedical research. Another advance is that wider available of complex cell models may reduce the need for animal testing in the drug development process.\" More information:Kathryn A.

  "text": "A Cornell-led collaboration harnessed chemical reactions to make microscale origami machines self-fold\u2014freeing them from the liquids in which they usually function, so they can operate in dry environments and at room temperature.          The approach could one day lead to the creation of a new fleet of tiny autonomous devices that can rapidly respond to their chemical environment.The group's paper, \"Gas-Phase Microactuation Using Kinetically Controlled Surface States of Ultrathin Catalytic Sheets,\" published May 1 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper's co-lead authors are Nanqi Bao, Ph.D. '22, and former postdoctoral researcher Qingkun Liu, Ph.D. '22.The project was led by senior author Nicholas Abbott, a Tisch University Professor in the Robert F. Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in Cornell Engineering, along with Itai Cohen, professor of physics, and Paul McEuen, the John A. Newman Professor of Physical Science, both in the College of Arts and Sciences; and David Muller, the Samuel B. Eckert Professor of Engineering in Cornell Engineering.\"There are quite good technologies for electrical to mechanical energy transduction, such as the electric motor, and the McEuen and Cohen groups have shown a strategy for doing that on the microscale, with their robots,\" Abbott said. \"But if you look for direct chemical to mechanical transductions, actually there are very few options.\"Reversible actuation of a SCA during cycles of exposure to a O2-H2 mixture (10:1) and H2 at room temperature (real time). Credit: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023). DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2221740120Prior efforts depended on chemical reactions that could only occur in extreme conditions, such as at high temperatures of several 100 degrees Celsius, and the reactions were often tediously slow\u2014sometimes as long as 10 minutes\u2014making the approach impractical for everyday technological applications.However, Abbott's group found a loophole of sorts while reviewing data from a catalysis experiment: a small section of the chemical reaction pathway contained both slow and fast steps.\"If you look at the response of the chemical actuator, it's not that it goes from one state directly to the other state. It actually goes through an excursion into a bent state, a curvature, which is more extreme than either of the two end states,\" Abbott said. \"If you understand the elementary reaction steps in a catalytic pathway, you can go in and sort of surgically extract out the rapid steps. You can operate your chemical actuator around those rapid steps, and just ignore the rest of it.\"      The researchers needed the right material platform to leverage that rapid kinetic moment, so they turned to McEuen and Cohen, who had worked with Muller to develop ultrathin platinum sheets capped with titanium.The group also collaborated with theorists, led by professor Manos Mavrikakis at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who used electronic structure calculations to dissect the chemical reaction that occurs when hydrogen\u2014adsorbed to the material\u2014is exposed to oxygen.The researchers were then able to exploit the crucial moment that the oxygen quickly strips the hydrogen, causing the atomically thin material to deform and bend, like a hinge.The system actuates at 600 milliseconds per cycle and can operate at 20 degrees Celsius\u2014i.e., room temperature\u2014in dry environments.\"The result is quite generalizable,\" Abbott said. \"There are a lot of catalytic reactions which have been developed based on all sorts of species. So carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia: they're all candidates to use as fuels for chemically driven actuators.\"The team anticipates applying the technique to other catalytic metals, such as palladium and palladium gold alloys. Eventually this work could lead to autonomous material systems in which the controlling circuitry and onboard computation are handled by the material's response\u2014for example, an autonomous chemical system that regulates flows based on chemical composition.\"We are really excited because this work paves the way to microscale origami machines that work in gaseous environments,\" Cohen said.

  "text": "Achieving sustainability goals will require the use of feedstocks such as plastics and biomass instead of oil. Moreover, industries are constantly searching for more efficient and sustainable processes, which often require precise simulations. In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, determining the energy of molecules adsorbed on surfaces is crucial to estimate catalyst performance, which is typically done using density functional theory (DFT). However, for large organic molecules like those in plastics and biomass, this cannot be done.          To address this issue, scientists from the Prof. L\u00f3pez research group at the Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia (ICIQ-CERCA) in collaboration with researchers from The Matter Lab (University of Toronto), have created a new model called GAME-Net, a graph neural network that rapidly evaluates adsorption energy when molecules attach to surfaces. Their research is published in the journal Nature Computational Science.Trained on a diverse dataset of small and medium-sized molecules containing functional groups, GAME-Net achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17 eV on the test set and is six orders of magnitude faster than DFT. When applied to biomass (wood) and plastic molecules with up to 30 atoms, the model predicts adsorption energies with a MAE of 0.016 eV/atom.GAME-Net is capable of estimating adsorption energy with an accuracy comparable to DFT, while utilizing a simple molecular representation. This breakthrough model opens up the possibility of predicting adsorption energy for larger molecules derived from biomass, polyurethanes, and plastics, enabling the study of chemical systems that are not easily amenable to DFT calculations. This revolutionary technology can be easily run on a laptop, making it accessible to scientists and researchers around the world.\"For us, this work represents a starting point for the practical implementation of Machine Learning algorithms for quantum chemistry in the typical workflow of both, experimental and computational, researchers in heterogenous catalysis. Even though GAME-Net presents some limitations, its speed, coupled with the simplicity in its structure, and the way of interfacing it, makes this model a valuable tool for the community,\" states Santiago Morandi from ICIQ.Let's 'KISS': Keep it small and simpleThe growing popularity of artificial intelligence has led to numerous attempts to improve its predictive capabilities. Among them are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a type of neural networks capable of learning the \"shape\" of data.The algorithm proposed by the researchers employs a simple graph representation where nodes correspond to atoms and edges represent chemical bonds. In order to predict the energy change when a catalyst interacts with a reactant molecule, a graph neural network is used, when typically, this change is obtained from DFT.      GAME-Net was trained on a diverse set of small molecules containing different heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. To initiate the process, researchers created the \"functional groups\" (FG)-dataset from scratch, which comprises 207 organic molecules adsorbed on 14 transition metals (Ag, Au, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, and Zn) on their lowest surface energy facets.To assure high reproducibility standards all the computational data generated in this study is accessible from the ioChem-BD repository. The code of the GAME-Net, together with the pre-trained model, have been released as open-source under the MIT license and can be downloaded from a repository.\"With this work we wanted to see if we were able to teach complex chemical interactions to an AI using the chemical representations we teach kids in high school. Surprisingly, our AI turned out to be an excellent student,\" says Dr. Pablo-Garc\u00eda Ph.D. student at ICIQ now at the University of Toronto.This innovative AI framework offers a powerful tool for quick screening of catalytic materials, especially for systems that are too challenging to simulate using traditional methods. Chemical industries can benefit from the integration of artificial intelligence in their research, to accelerate the understanding and design of heterogeneous catalysts for the development of more sustainable processes. GAME-Net is open to new and exciting improvements, such as specific reaction steps and, as well, more complex catalyst materials.\"Beyond the short-term impact our work may have, our model demonstrates that AIs are capable of describing complex chemical interactions using extremely simple models, making them more accessible to scientists who want to accelerate their research,\" conclude Dr. Pablo-Garc\u00eda and Santiago Morandi.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the plant that is used for treating addiction?",
  "answer_squad": " iboga",
  "text": "Scientists have developed two new drug candidates for potentially treating addiction and depression, modeled on the pharmacology of a traditional African psychedelic plant medicine called ibogaine. At very low doses, these new compounds were able to blunt symptoms of both conditions in mice.          The findings, published May 2 in Cell, took inspiration from ibogaine's impact on the serotonin transporter (SERT), which is also the target of SSRI antidepressants like fluoxetine (Prozac). A team of scientists from UCSF, Yale and Duke universities virtually screened 200 million molecular structures to find ones that blocked SERT in the same way as ibogaine.\"Some people swear by ibogaine for treating addiction, but it isn't a very good drug. It has bad side effects, and it's not approved for use in the U.S.,\" said Brian Shoichet, Ph.D., co-senior author and professor in the UCSF School of Pharmacy. \"Our compounds mimic just one of ibogaine's many pharmacological effects, and still replicate its most desirable effects on behavior, at least in mice.\"Dozens of scientists from the laboratories of Shoichet, Allan Basbaum, Ph.D., and Aashish Manglik, MD, Ph.D., (UCSF); Gary Rudnick, Ph.D., (Yale); and Bill Wetsel, Ph.D., (Duke) helped demonstrate the real-world promise of these novel molecules, which were initially identified using Shoichet's computational docking methods.Docking involves systematically testing virtual chemical structures for binding with a protein, enabling scientists to identify new drug leads without having to synthesize them in the lab.\"This kind of project begins with visualizing what kinds of molecules will fit into a protein, docking the library, optimizing, and then relying on a team to show the molecules work,\" said Isha Singh, Ph.D., a co-first author of the paper who did the work as a postdoc in Shoichet's lab. \"Now we know there's a lot of untapped therapeutic potential in targeting SERT.\"Ibogaine is found in the roots of the iboga plant, which is native to central Africa, and has been used for millennia during shamanistic rituals. In the 19th and 20th centuries, doctors in Europe and the U.S. experimented with its use in treating a variety of ailments, but the drug never gained widespread acceptance and was ultimately made illegal in many countries.      Part of the problem, Shoichet explained, is that ibogaine interferes with many aspects of human biology.\"Ibogaine binds to hERG, which can cause heart arrhythmias, and from a scientific standpoint, it's a 'dirty' drug, binding to lots of targets beyond SERT,\" Shoichet said. \"Before this experiment, we didn't even know if the benefits of ibogaine came from its binding to SERT.\"Shoichet, who has used docking on brain receptors to identify drugs to treat depression and pain, became interested in SERT and ibogaine after Rudnick, an expert on SERT at Yale, spent a sabbatical in his lab. Singh picked up the project in 2018, hoping to turn the buzz around ibogaine into a better understanding of SERT.It was the Shoichet lab's first docking experiment on a transporter\u2014a protein that moves molecules into and out of cells\u2014rather than a receptor. One round of docking whittled the virtual library from 200 million to just 49 molecules, 36 of which could be synthesized. Rudnick's lab tested them and found that 13 inhibited SERT.The team then held virtual-reality-guided \"docking parties,\" to help Singh prioritize five molecules for optimization. The two most potent SERT inhibitors were shared with Basbaum and Wetsel's teams for rigorous testing on animal models of addiction, depression, and anxiety.\"All of a sudden, they popped\u2014that's when these drugs looked a lot more potent than even paroxetine [Paxil],\" Shoichet said.Manglik, an expert with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), confirmed that one of the two drugs, dubbed '8090, fit into SERT at the atomic level in a way that closely resembled Singh and Shoichet's computational predictions. The drugs inhibited SERT in a similar way to ibogaine, but unlike the psychedelic, their effect was potent and selective, with no spillover impacts on a panel of hundreds of other receptors and transporters.\"With this sort of potency, we hope to have a better therapeutic window without side effects,\" Basbaum said. \"Dropping the dose almost 200-fold could make a big difference for patients.Shoichet has submitted the structures of both new molecules to Sigma Aldrich, the chemical manufacturing company, aiming to make the them available for further testing by other scientists, while he continues to hunt for more precise moleculesWith millions of patients continuing to suffer from depression or addiction, new prospective therapies are needed.\"This is really the way science should be done,\" Basbaum said. \"We took a group with expertise in disparate fields and came up with something that might really make a difference.\" More information:Brian K.

  "text": "Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) have developed a method to synthesize the highly potent antimalarial drug artemisinin, which could lead to a more cost-effective treatment for malaria.          The work was recently featured on the cover of the journal Organic Letters.In 2021, 247 million cases of malaria led to 619,000 deaths worldwide. The most effective malaria treatments utilize the drug artemisinin, which is derived from the sweet wormwood plant, Artemisia annua. However, the process of isolating artemisinin from the plant is time-consuming, and crop yields are susceptible to weather patterns, insect pests and other factors. Despite scientific advancements in treatment methods, the cost of artemisinin still burdens the countries most affected by malaria.\"We were able to develop a novel way of synthesizing artemisinin that mimics how it's made in nature,\" SwRI Senior Research Scientist Dr. Shawn Blumberg said. \"Our method mimics the biosynthetic pathway of how artemisinin is made in the plant where it originates, Artemisia annua. We studied the intermediate compounds along that pathway and then used chemistry to create those same intermediates and recreate the pathway.\"\"There was nothing in public scientific literature that suggested this would work,\" Frantz said. \"This was challenging chemistry that we were trying to pull off, but we let science tell us where to go. It enabled us to design a process of taking a common intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway for artemisinin and converting it all the way to Artemisinic acid, which is the direct precursor to artemisinin.\"Blumberg and Frantz hope drug companies will take advantage of their work and offer a more potent and cost-effective malaria treatment to the impoverished countries that need it the most, especially considering the inherent risks of drought, wildfire and insects that come with depending on a plant that can only grow in certain parts of the world.\"The supply of artemisinin is still kind of erratic, which causes prices to be erratic as well, and countries dealing with this endemic need a stable, cost-effective solution,\" Blumberg said. \"While the new process we've created might not completely supplant current methods, it can complement other approaches and help to stabilize the world's supply of artemisinin.\" More information:Nicholas A.

  "question_squad": " What is the term for the area above the liquid that whiskies react to when water is added?",
  "answer_squad": " headspace",
  "text": "While adding a little water is popularly thought to \"open up\" the flavor of whisky, a Washington State University-led study indicates there's a point at which it becomes too much: about 20%.          Researchers chemically analyzed how volatile compounds in a set of 25 whiskies responded to the addition of water, including bourbons, ryes, Irish whiskeys and both single malt and blended Scotches. They also had a trained sensory panel assess six of those whiskies, three Scotches and three bourbons.Both tests found that adding a little water could change how the whiskies smelled, but after 20%, they may start to have the same aroma. Since smell and taste are often closely linked, this likely affected the spirit's flavor as well.\"If you want to enjoy a specific whisky, this suggests that you don't want to dilute it by more than about 20%,\" said Tom Collins, a WSU assistant professor and senior author on the study in the journal Foods. \"By the time you get to 60/40 whisky to water, the whiskies are not differentiated by the panelists; they begin to smell the same, and that's not really what you're looking for.\"Working with Elizabeth Tomasino at Oregon State University to run the sensory panel, the researchers found that at 100% whisky, the panelists could easily tell all the whiskies apart from each other. At 80/20 whisky to water, they could still differentiate whiskies within each group, but after more water was added, that changed.While within each style of whisky the aromas became more similar, the larger grouping of Scotches, both single malts and blended, remained distinct from the American bourbons and ryes.The chemical analysis revealed similar results showing the changes in volatile compounds that entered the \"headspace,\" or the area above the liquid, when water was added.Whisky is a mix of compounds that run the scale from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, in other words, ones that are attracted to water and others that are repelled by it. The addition of water sends the whisky's hydrophobic compounds into that headspace and leaves the hydrophilic ones behind, changing the aroma of the liquid.The researchers found that the chemical analysis matched the impressions of the educated panel. For instance, many of the Scotch whiskies started out with a smoky, \"peat\" aroma, but as they were diluted, they moved toward a fruitier aroma known as \"pome.\"\"This happens because of the way dilution affects what's in the headspace,\" said Collins. \"The compounds that are associated with smoky aromas dissipate, and they were replaced by compounds that are associated with fruity aromas.\"Likewise, the American bourbons were mostly associated with vanilla and oak scents at first, but as more water was added, they took on more aromas of the corn and grains used to make them.The findings can help whisky makers better understand how their customers will experience the drink if they chose to add water or have it \"on the rocks.\"It also gives some backing to the practice of serving whisky with a single, large ice cube.\"This study helps to understand why those large, square ice cubes have become so popular because you can actually enjoy the whisky before it gets diluted to the point that it's not the same whisky,\" said Collins.Collins and his colleagues are currently further investigating the compounds that give Scotch whiskies their smoky aroma. They plan to present that ongoing work as well as this study at the Worldwide Distilled Spirits Conference in Edinburgh, Scotland taking place May 9-11.In addition to Collins and Tomasino, co-authors on this study include Aubrey DuBois of Michigan State University as well as first author P. Layton Ashmore and James Harbertson of WSU. More information:P. Layton Ashmore et al, Impact of Dilution on Whisky Aroma: A Sensory and Volatile Composition Analysis, Foods (2023).

  "text": "A research team from the National University of Singapore (NUS) has successfully used common plant proteins to 3D-print an edible cell culture scaffold, allowing more affordable and sustainable lab-grown meat to be served on the table.          As consumers become more conscious of the environmental and ethical ramifications of their food, lab-grown meat, also known as cultured meat or cell-based meat, is becoming an increasingly popular source of dietary protein. Cultured meat is produced by taking skeletal muscle cells from animals and growing them on three-dimensional constructs called scaffolds, which provide structural support as the cells multiply and develop into tissues.However, cell culture scaffolds are typically made from synthetic or animal-based materials, which are either too expensive or inedible. In search of an alternative, the team led by Professor Huang Dejian, Deputy Head of the NUS Department of Food Science and Technology, turned to plant proteins, which are known to be biodegradable and biocompatible with animal cells. Crucially, plant proteins also satisfy common requirements for food consumption, making the resulting scaffold fit for culturing meat.\"By using readily available cereal prolamins as biomaterials for high-precision 3D printing technology, we open up a new method for manufacturing edible and structured scaffolds to produce cultured muscle meat slices with fibrous qualities,\" said Prof Huang.The team's work, in line with NUS' thrust to produce cutting-edge sustainability research, was published in the journal Advanced Materials.The making of an edible scaffoldProlamins are a family of plant storage proteins that, due to their specific amino acid profile, have low nutritional value. In fact, prolamins are generated as waste in the starch and vegetable oil industries. Nevertheless, Prof Huang and his team leveraged these characteristics of prolamins to come up with an affordable and sustainable resource for meat culture.Specifically, the researchers used mixtures of prolamins derived from corn, barley and rye flour, also known as zeins, hordeins and secalins, respectively. These mixtures then acted as the ink for electrohydrodynamic printing, a high-precision 3D printing technology commonly employed in biomedical applications.To assess whether the prolamin constructs were fit for meat cultivation, they were submerged in the cell culture medium and inspected seven days later to examine any structural changes. Under a scanning electron microscope, the scaffolds held their structure and did not collapse, though multiple holes did develop on their surfaces. According to the researchers, however, these pores are more likely the result of enzymes secreted by the cultured cells rather than evidence of structural weaknesses.For scaffolds to be of any use in cultivating meat, they need to be biocompatible with muscle cells from agricultural animals, meaning that they need to be able to accommodate these cells and support their growth and development.To test this, Prof Huang and team seeded the prolamin constructs with stem cells from pig skeletal muscle and measured cell proliferation over the following days. They found that the cells divided extensively on the scaffolds, reaching a maximum count 11 days after they were inoculated. The stem cells grew comparably well in both zein/hordein and zein/secalin scaffolds.Of significance, when compared against a standard polycaprolactone scaffold, a common tool in tissue engineering, pig cells seeded onto the prolamin constructs proliferated much faster, demonstrating that the plant protein-based scaffold was more feasible for cultured meat production than standard synthetic polymers.\"Scaffolds made from plant proteins are edible and have diverse and variable peptide sequences that can facilitate cell attachment, induce differentiation, and speed up the growth of meat. In contrast, synthetic scaffolds such as plastic beads used for cultured meat have no functional group which makes it difficult for animal cells to attach and proliferate. In addition, synthetic scaffolds are not edible and extra steps are required to separate the scaffolds from the meat culture,\" elaborated Prof Huang.As a proof of-concept, the research team tried to produce an actual slice of meat by culturing pig skin stem cells on a zein/secalin scaffold, and then allowed them to differentiate, or mature, into muscle. Beet extract was used to simulate meat's reddish color.Their experiment turned out to be a success. Within 12 days, the research team was able to culture meat that was similar in texture and overall appearance to real animal meat.\"Since the scaffold was edible, no special or additional procedures were needed to extract it from the final product,\" shares Prof Huang. These results further verify the potential of the proposed prolamin-based scaffolds in cultivated meat production.\"      Further developmentsProf Huang and his team are actively working on refining the plant protein-based technology. For instance, more studies are needed to better determine how the particular structure and composition of the prolamin constructs might impact the growth of animal stem cells and how they form muscle tissue.\"Moreover, we need to ensure the resulting meat products are market-ready, with safety profiles that will satisfy rigorous regulatory demands and nutritional compositions that will fulfill recommended dietary needs,\" says Prof Huang. \"Of course, they need to be appetizing, too. Flavor, aroma and texture need to be carefully calibrated to compete with traditionally farmed meat products.\" More information:Lingshan Su et al, 3D\u2010Printed Prolamin Scaffolds for Cell\u2010Based Meat Culture, Advanced Materials (2022).

  "text": "A firefighter's protective clothing, called turnout gear, is essential for operating in the dangerous conditions of a fire. However, the firefighting community has raised concerns regarding the presence of a class of chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\u2014some of which have been linked to cancer\u2014in the gear.          Until recently, the public has had little information regarding the specific types, quantities and location of PFAS in firefighter equipment, but now, a new report sheds light.Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have conducted an in-depth examination of a range of textiles used in turnout gear coats and pants, which are constructed in three layers. The results showed that the amount of PFAS present varies widely between manufacturers and layers, with the highest PFAS concentrations observed in the outermost two. The results of the study suggest that selecting optimal combinations of fabrics for each layer could significantly reduce the amount of PFAS present in turnout gear.PFAS, which are ubiquitous in manufactured products due to their oil- and water-resistant properties, do not break down easily and persist in our bodies and the environment, earning them the moniker of \"forever chemicals.\" These suspected carcinogens have found their way into the bodies of most Americans. However, researchers have shown that firefighters are burdened by comparatively high levels of at least one type of PFAS.The first step to better protecting firefighters from this potential health hazard is to learn about the sources of PFAS exposure, which may include their protective gear.\"At NIST, we're trying to figure out what is in there. How much? What type?\" said NIST researcher Rick Davis, a study co-author. \"Once we answer that, then researchers can start to answer questions about how it's getting into firefighters' systems. Do they inhale it? Do they ingest it? Does it pass through their skin?\"The research team collected 20 brand-new textile samples, each used for one of the three layers of turnout gear\u2014the outer shell, the moisture barrier and the thermal liner. All meet a standard published by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), which specifies requirements for resisting heat, water and other hazards.For the researchers, quantifying the concentration of any other chemical would have likely been standard fare, but PFAS brought forth unique challenges. Contamination is almost always a concern in chemical analysis, as chemicals from outside the sample can skew results. In this study, the authors encountered external sources of PFAS at nearly every turn.      \"It was a big challenge. Most of our analytical equipment contains fluoropolymers that could leach out PFAS. But over the years, we've developed ways to reduce contamination,\" said NIST researcher and study co-author John Kucklick. \"In some cases, there was contamination, but we were able to identify and flag it.\"The researchers relied heavily on existing PFAS standards\u2014highly accurate and pure PFAS samples of a known concentration\u2014to ensure that the methods they used to measure PFAS levels produced accurate results. The team also employed several measurement techniques in parallel to further ensure their findings could be trusted.The researchers targeted 53 PFAS within 20 textiles used to fabricate the different layers of turnout gear. They identified and quantified the concentrations of 26 different PFAS, uncovering some important differences among the samples.The team found the least amount of PFAS in the layer closest to firefighters' skin, the thermal lining, which may correspond to water repellency being a lower priority for this layer than the other two.At the other end of the spectrum, the moisture barrier and the outer shell contained PFAS concentrations up to 400 times higher, though those numbers varied widely from fabric to fabric.Two of the outer shell textiles they tested had not been treated with a water repellant coating. Those samples contained far less PFAS than other outer shell layers, while the treated outer shell fabric consistently contained the greatest amounts of PFAS.\"If you changed to a non-PFAS water repellant coating on the outer shell, then you essentially eliminate PFAS from that layer. There isn't much in the thermal liner to begin with. So really the one layer left to address is the moisture barrier,\" Davis said. \"On paper this sounds easy to solve\u2014just use a non-PFAS based water repellent\u2014but we need to know we aren't just swapping out one risk for another.\"Ongoing work at NIST is aiming to unveil the effects that wear and tear\u2014UV exposure, heat, laundering, etc.\u2014have on measurable PFAS in turnout gear. The researchers suspect that regular use may lead more PFAS to escape from the gear.The results of that research should further cement our understanding of what is inside the gear. NIST is also completing a similar study of PFAS in new and stressed hoods, gloves and wildland gear.Additionally, NIST has started planning research to study fire scenes, fire stations and other occupational environments firefighters work in.\"While we are starting to understand PFAS in the firefighter gear, we don't know to what extent firefighters may be exposed to PFAS from their workplace,\" Davis said. \"Understanding what PFAS are in the workplace tells a more complete story of the firefighter's exposure.\"Further research by federal partners will focus on what kinds and levels of PFAS are dangerous and how the chemicals find their way into firefighters' bodies.Together, that information could be used to update turnout equipment standards and give firefighters confidence that the equipment meant to have their backs is not turning on them.The research was published by NIST.

  "text": "In an effort to make textiles more sustainable, a new method allows researchers to break old clothing down chemically and reuse polyester compounds to create fire resistant, anti-bacterial or wrinkle-free coatings that could then be applied to clothes and fabrics.          The proof-of-principle study provides hope for unsustainable textile, apparel and footwear industries that together generate 20% of global solid waste. Many so-called recyclers end up illegally dumping textiles as trash in countries in Asia and Africa.\"We think that our clothes are recycled or reprocessed, but most of the time they are actually sent to other places as solid waste,\" said Juan Hinestroza, the Rebecca Q. Morgan '60 Professor of Fiber Science & Apparel Design and director of the Textiles Nanotechnology Laboratory in the College of Human Ecology. \"Our main goal is to offer a pathway to reuse this material.\"The paper, \"Upcycling of Dyed Polyester Fabrics into Copper-1, 4-Benzeedicarboxylate Metal-Organic Frameworks,\" published March 30 in the journal Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, describes the process of cutting textiles into pieces and chemically decomposing them into a soup of raw materials, dyes, additives, dirt and esters. A metal solution is added and building blocks from the polyester share an affinity with the metal, and selectively link together metal compounds forming tiny cages (called metal-organic frameworks) that settle to the bottom of the soup.The cages that form are then used to make coatings, which may require minor structural tweaks to tailor each to specific uses. These might include coatings that make permanent press shirts that don't wrinkle, antibacterial surgical gowns or scrubs, or baby or industrial clothes that require a fire-retardant protection.\"One goal of my lab is to create a universal coating that will serve all these purposes, though we are still far away from that,\" Hinestroza said.Yelin Ko, a doctoral student in the field of human centered design, is the paper's first author. Prior to this research, some believed the dyes and impurities in the mix would interfere with the process, but this proof-of-principle of the method\u2014known as controlled crystallization\u2014shows that the polyester-derived linkers can seek out and attach to metal compounds in solution, in spite of other present materials.The research describes a closed loop process, where discarded materials may be reused and contribute to a circular economy\u2014a focus for many sustainability researchers at Cornell, Hinestroza said.

  "text": "Different market products give very different results when it comes to liberating the antioxidant lutein from spinach in smoothies. Researchers at Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden, have examined 14 common dairy and plant-based products and found that only four of these increased lutein liberation. Compared to water, some drinks had a negative effect on the lutein content in spinach smoothies.          Most people know that spinach is good for your health. One substance found in, for instance, spinach and kale is lutein. Several experimental studies have shown that lutein can suppress processes linked to inflammation, and there is now ample research indicating that chronic low-grade inflammation is an important risk factor in cardiovascular disease.\"Lutein is a bio-active compound. We have studied lutein in a similar way to studying a pharmaceutical drug. In this study, we looked at lutein liberation from fresh spinach,\" says Rosanna Chung, assistant professor in the Department of Health, Medicine and Caring Sciences at Link\u00f6ping University, who led the study published in Nutrients.As our bodies cannot produce lutein, the researchers behind the study were interested to find out how to optimize lutein intake from foods. The research group previously showed that preparation methods where the spinach is heated break down some of the lutein, whereas mixing it into a smoothie makes more lutein available for absorption.The type of liquid used in the smoothie can also affect lutein content. As lutein dissolves in fat but not in water, it needs gastric juice and/or other food components to be liberated from the plant material and absorbed by our intestines. The researchers suspected that some components in our food, such as fat, carbohydrates, proteins and fibers, can affect the amount of lutein available for absorption. The effect of products such as yogurt may also differ due to fermentation. However, products widely available on the market are rarely examined in scientific studies.The researchers have examined the effects of various products available from food shops on the amount of lutein liberated in smoothies. Both dairy and plant-based liquids were tested.The researchers blended spinach with the various products. They then used a method simulating human digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, by adding digestive enzymes. Finally, the amount of lutein available for the body to absorb in smoothies made with various products was compared to that in smoothies made with just water.\"We could see that only four of the 14 examined products increased the liberation of lutein from spinach compared to water. Cow's milk with a high fat content as well as coconut milk improved lutein liberation. Yogurt, however, which is regarded as comparable to cow's milk and is often used in caf\u00e9s and similar, did not show particularly good results,\" says Rosanna Chung.The fact that yogurt is not that good at liberating lutein may have to do with the fermentation process. It also turned out that plant-based drinks, often made from nuts, legumes or oats, showed significantly different results.\"Plant-based liquids have become increasingly common in smoothies. We saw that soymilk was actually less effective than water when it comes to liberating lutein in spinach smoothies. In other words, soymilk had a negative effect on lutein liberation in our study,\" says Jan Neelissen, doctorate student and one of the researchers behind the study.The other plant-based products in the study did not affect lutein liberation compared to water. As a general piece of information, smoothies should be consumed as soon as possible, because lutein breaks down quickly.It is important to note that whereas the results from this study indicate how much lutein is available for the body to absorb, no conclusions can be drawn as to how much lutein is actually absorbed. Therefore, the researchers will be conducting a human study in which they will measure the amount of lutein absorbed from smoothies made with different products.

  "text": "A research group at Nagoya University in Japan has successfully developed an ultrafast and simple synthetic method for producing indole derivatives. Their findings are expected to make drug production more efficient and increase the range of potential indole-based pharmaceuticals to treat a variety of diseases. Their findings were published in Communications Chemistry.          An indole is an organic compound consisting of a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring. Heteroatom alkylation at the carbon atom next the indole ring is particularly useful to create wide range of new indole derivatives and many anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial treatments contain themIn the past, this heteroatom alkylation has proven difficult because indoles easily and rapidly undergo unwanted dimerization/multimerization, processes in which two or more molecules combine during the reaction to form unwanted larger molecules. These unwanted by-products limit the yield of the desired product.Since indoles are common to so many drugs, an efficient method of synthesizing them is essential. Now, a team consisting of Assistant Professor Hisashi Masui (he/him), graduate student Sena Kanda (she/her), and Professor Shinichiro Fuse (he/him) at the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya University, obtained the target indole-based product in high yield while limiting side reactions using a new microflow synthesis method.Their method consists of flowing a solution through a small channel with an inner diameter of about 1 mm. Because of its small size, the channel has a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, allowing the solution to be mixed in a few milliseconds. This allows for precise control of short reaction times and limits the time when unstable intermediates are present in the reaction process to only about 0.1 seconds. This is fast enough to prevent unwanted dimerization/multimerization.\"Although it takes several seconds to mix solutions using a flask, the microflow synthesis method does it in less than a few milliseconds,\" Fuse said.\"Therefore, short reaction times of less than a second can be generated and more precisely controlled and the reaction temperature can be fully controlled. We created an activated indole compound in 20 ms to achieve a target product yield of 95%. When the same reaction was performed in a standard flask, the target product could not be obtained at all, and side reactions occurred during the mixing of the solutions.\"\"Since the developed method can be used to synthesize various indole derivatives, our study is useful for creating drug candidates and improving the efficiency of drug production,\" said Fuse. \"The reaction proceeds at an extremely high speed under mild room temperature conditions, and the reactants used are readily available and inexpensive, making it highly practical.\"The group sees many potential industrial applications. Fuse emphasized that the flow synthesis method can be reproducibly scaled up by continuous pumping, making it an ideal choice for manufacturing facilities. \"Indoles are one of the most abundant structures in pharmaceuticals,\" he said. \"We expect it to contribute to the creation of drug candidates and the efficiency of pharmaceutical production.\" More information:Hisashi Masui et al, Verification of preparations of (1H-indol-3-yl)methyl electrophiles and development of their microflow rapid generation and substitution, Communications Chemistry (2023).

  "text": "Scientists from around the world have developed a simple metallic coating treatment for clothing or wearable textiles which can repair itself, repel bacteria from the wearer and even monitor a person's electrocardiogram (ECG) heart signals.          Researchers from North Carolina State University, Flinders University and South Korea say the conductive circuits created by liquid metal (LM) particles can transform wearable electronics and open doors for further development of human-machine interfaces, including soft robotics and health monitoring systems.The \"breathable\" electronic textiles have special connectivity powers to \"autonomously heal\" itself even when cut, says the U.S. team led by international expert in the field, Professor Michael Dickey.When the coated textiles are pressed with significant force, the particles merge into a conductive path, which enables the creation of circuits that can maintain conductivity when stretched, researchers say.\"The conductive patterns autonomously heal when cut by forming new conductive paths along the edge of the cut, providing a self-healing feature which makes these textiles useful as circuit interconnects, Joule heaters and flexible electrodes to measure ECG signals,\" says Flinders University medical biotechnology researcher Dr. Khanh Truong, senior co-author in a new article in Advanced Materials Technologies.The technique involves dip-coating fabric into a suspension of LM particles at room temperature.                Dr Vi-Khanh Truong, left, with masters biotech student Tien Thanh Nguyen at the Flinders University lab. Credit: Flinders University             \"Evenly coated textiles remain electrically insulating due to the native oxide that forms on the LM particles. However, the insulating effect can be removed by compressing the textile to rupture the oxide and thereby allow the particles to percolate.\"This enables the creation of conductive circuits by compressing the textile with a patterned mold. The electrical conductivity of the circuits increases by coating more particles on the textile\" say the researchers.As well the LM-coated textiles offer effective antimicrobial protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.This germ repellent ability not only gives the treated fabric protective qualities but prevents the porous material from becoming contaminated if worn for and extended time, or put in contact with other people.The particles of gallium-based liquid metals have low melting point, metallic electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity, effectively zero vapor pressure, low toxicity and antimicrobial properties.LMs have both fluidic and metallic properties so show great promise in applications such as microfluidics, soft composites, sensors, thermal switches and microelectronics.One of the advantages of LM is that it can be deposited and patterned at room temperature onto surfaces in unconventional ways that are not possible with solid metals.

  "question_squad": " What is the chemical formula of hydroxyl radicals?",
  "answer_squad": " OH",
  "text": "The human body relies heavily on electrical charges. Lightning-like pulses of energy fly through the brain and nerves and most biological processes depend on electrical ions traveling across the membranes of each cell in our body.          These electrical signals are possible, in part, because of an imbalance in electrical charges that exists on either side of a cellular membrane. Until recently, researchers believed the membrane was an essential component to creating this imbalance. But that thought was turned on its head when researchers at Stanford University discovered that similar imbalanced electrical charges can exist between microdroplets of water and air.Now, researchers at Duke University have discovered that these types of electric fields also exist within and around another type of cellular structure called biological condensates. Like oil droplets floating in water, these structures exist because of differences in density. They form compartments inside the cell without needing the physical boundary of a membrane.Inspired by previous research demonstrating that microdroplets of water interacting with air or solid surfaces create tiny electrical imbalances, the researchers decided to see if the same was true for small biological condensates. They also wanted to see if these imbalances sparked reactive oxygen, \"redox,\" reactions like these other systems.Appearing on April 28 in the journal Chem, their foundational discovery could change the way researchers think about biological chemistry. It could also provide a clue as to how the first life on Earth harnessed the energy needed to arise.\"In a prebiotic environment without enzymes to catalyze reactions, where would the energy come from?\" asked Yifan Dai, a Duke postdoctoral researcher working in the laboratory of Ashutosh Chilkoti, the Alan L. Kaganov Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Lingchong You, the James L. Meriam Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering.\"This discovery provides a plausible explanation of where the reaction energy could have come from, just as the potential energy that is imparted on a point charge placed in an electric field,\" Dai said.When electric charges jump between one material and another, they can produce molecular fragments that can pair up and form hydroxyl radicals, which have the chemical formula OH. These can then pair again to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tiny but detectable amounts.      \"But interfaces have seldom been studied in biological regimes other than the cellular membrane, which is one of the most essential part of biology,\" said Dai. \"So we were wondering what might be happening at the interface of biological condensates, that is, if it is an asymmetric system too.\"Cells can build biological condensates to either separate or trap together certain proteins and molecules, either hindering or promoting their activity. Researchers are just beginning to understand how condensates work and what they could be used for.Because the Chilkoti laboratory specializes in creating synthetic versions of naturally occurring biological condensates, the researchers were easily able to create a test bed for their theory. After combining the right formula of building blocks to create minuscule condensates, with help from postdoctoral scholar Marco Messina in? Christopher J. Chang's group at the University of California\u2014Berkeley, they added a dye to the system that glows in the presence of reactive oxygen species.Their hunch was right. When the environmental conditions were right, a solid glow started from the edges of the condensates, confirming that a previously unknown phenomenon was at work. Dai next talked with Richard Zare, the Marguerite Blake Wilbur Professor of Chemistry at Stanford, whose group established the electric behavior of water droplets. Zare was excited to hear about the new behavior in biological systems, and started to work with the group on the underlying mechanism.\"Inspired by previous work on water droplets, my graduate student, Christian Chamberlayne, and I thought that the same physical principles might apply and promote redox chemistry, such as the formation of hydrogen peroxide molecules,\" Zare said. \"These findings suggest why condensates are so important in the functioning of cells.\"\"Most previous work on biomolecular condensates has focused on their innards,\" Chilkoti said. \"Yifan's discovery that biomolecular condensates appear to be universally redox-active suggests that condensates did not simply evolve to carry out specific biological functions as is commonly understood, but that they are also endowed with a critical chemical function that is essential to cells.\"While the biological implications of this ongoing reaction within our cells is not known, Dai points to a prebiotic example of how powerful its effects might be. The powerhouses of our cells, called mitochondria, create energy for all of our life's functions through the same basic chemical process. But before mitochondria or even the simplest of cells existed, something had to provide energy for the very first of life's functions to begin working.Researchers have proposed that the energy was provided by thermal vents in the oceans or hot springs. Others have suggested this same redox reaction that occurs in water microdroplets was created by the spray of ocean waves.But why not condensates instead?\"Magic can happen when substances get tiny and the interfacial volume becomes enormous compared to its volume,\" Dai said. \"I think the implications are important to many different fields.\" More information:Yifan Dai et al, Interface of biomolecular condensates modulates redox reactions, Chem (2023).

Recently, a research group led by Prof. Li Haiyang from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has developed a flow-assisted photoionization mass spectrometry method for profiling hydrogen cyanide in exhaled breath.The study was published in Analytical Chemistry on April 4.\"HCN is easily soluble in water and highly adsorbed on device surfaces, so sensitivity and response speed are main challenges for directly measuring HCN in exhaled breath at high humidity presents,\" said Prof. Chen Ping, co-corresponding author of this study.The researchers developed a method by utilizing a self-developed atmospheric pressure negative photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer instrument and improved the sensitivity and time resolution of direct HCN measurements in exhaled breath. This method enabled real-time tracking of HCN concentrations in a single exhaled breath, which could provide an effective means for early screening of CF patients with PA infection.They proposed to use helium shield gas within the mass spectrometry ionization source. This approach reduced the effect of high humidity on ionization, improved ion transport efficiency, and thus enhanced HCN detection sensitivity.Moreover, they improved the sampling system by shortening the sampling line and adding a gas purging process to effectively reduce HCN adsorption residue and improve time resolution. This method achieved a limit of detection of 0.3 ppbv and a resolution time of 0.5 s.By utilizing this method, the researchers tracked the changes in the single exhaled HCN profiles of volunteers before and after gargling. The resulting profiles clearly showed an early peak and a stable end-tidal plateau, representing the concentration of the oral cavity and end-tidal gas, respectively.\"The new method demonstrated good resistance to interference and high accuracy in HCN quantification. It has potential applications in the detection of PA infection in CF patients,\" said Prof. Li.

  "text": "People's ability to regenerate bones declines with age and is further decreased by diseases such as osteoporosis. To help the aging population, researchers are looking for new therapies that improve bone regeneration.          Now, an interdisciplinary team of researchers from the Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC) and the Medical Faculty of TU Dresden along with a group from Max Bergmann Center of Biomaterials (MBC) developed novel bio-inspired molecules that enhance bone regeneration in mice. The results were published in the journal Biomaterials.As people age, their ability to regenerate bones decreases. Fractures take longer to heal and diseases like osteoporosis only add to it. This represents a serious health challenge to the aging population and an increasing socioeconomic burden for the society. To help combat this issue, researchers are looking for new therapeutic approaches that can improve bone regeneration.A team of scientists from Dresden used computer modeling and simulations to design novel bio-inspired molecules to enhance bone regeneration in mice. The new molecules can be incorporated into biomaterials and applied locally to bone defects. These new molecules are based on glycosaminoglycans, which are long-chained sugars such as hyaluronic acid or heparin.A sweet solution for an old bone\"Thanks to our group's work and the work of other researchers, we know a distinct molecular pathway that regulates bone formation and repair. In fact, we can narrow it down to two proteins that work together to block bone regeneration, sclerostin and dickkopf-1\" explains Prof. Lorenz Hofbauer, \"The big challenge for developing drugs that improve bone healing is to efficiently turn off both of these proteins, which act as brake signals, at the same time.\"An interdisciplinary approach was a key to this challenge. The Structural Bioinformatics group led by Prof. Maria Teresa Pisabarro at the Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC) of TU Dresden and the Functional Biomaterials group led by PD Dr. Vera Hintze at the Max Bergmann Center of Biomaterials (MBC), Institute of Materials Science of TU Dresden combined their know-how with bone expert Prof. Lorenz Hofbauer at the Medical Faculty of TU Dresden.\"For several years, we have harnessed the power of computer simulations to investigate how proteins regulating bone formation interact with their receptors. All this to design new molecules that can efficiently interfere with these interactions. We worked in tandem between the computer and the bench, designing new molecules and testing them, feeding the results back to our molecular models and learning more about the molecular properties required for our goal,\" explains Prof. Pisabarro.Finally, the team of Lorenz Hofbauer's Bone Lab used a biomaterial loaded with the new molecules on bone defects in mice to test their effectiveness. The group found that materials containing the novel molecules outperformed the standard biomaterial and enhanced bone healing by up to 50%, which indicates their potential for improving bone regeneration.      Value-added chain: From computer to the lab bench and backThe multidisciplinary team used rational drug design to create novel molecules with tailored properties and minimal side effects. By using computational methods to predict and refine the properties of the designed molecules, the team was able to develop a series of candidates with the greatest potential for turning off the proteins that block bone regeneration.Pisabarro group's expertise allowed the thorough analysis of the three-dimensional (3D) structures of the two proteins that block bone regeneration. With that, they were able to model their interaction with their receptors in 3D and identify so-called hot spots, i.e., specific physicochemical and dynamic properties that are essential for the biological interaction to occur.\"We used molecular modeling to design new structures that mimic relevant receptor interactions with both proteins. We wanted this binding to be stronger than their natural interactions. In this way, our novel molecules would simultaneously hijack the proteins and effectively turn them off to turn the bone regeneration on,\" explains Prof. Pisabarro.\"The molecules designed by Pisabarro's group were synthesized by our colleagues at the Free University of Berlin and then analyzed regarding their protein binding properties via biophysical interaction analysis,\" says PD Dr. Hintze. \"For each of the molecules we were able to measure the binding strength with the proteins and their interference with natural receptor binding of the proteins. Thus, we could reveal empirically how effective each of the small molecules could be at turning off the inhibitory proteins.\" Hofbauer group then tested the biological relevance of these interaction studies in a cell culture model and later in mice.The results of such iterative testing are a valuable asset that enhances the current molecular models of the Pisabarro group and can be used to guide the development of novel and better molecules in the future. Such an approach also ensures that animal research is minimized and enters the project only in its final phase.The team's findings represent an exciting step forward in preclinical development. The newly designed molecules could potentially be used to turn off the proteins that block bone regeneration and lead to the development of novel, more effective treatments for bone fractures and other bone-related conditions.

  "answer_squad": " animal feed",
  "text": "Ensuring the supply of food to the constantly growing world population and protecting the environment at the same time are often conflicting objectives. Now researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have successfully developed a method for the synthetic manufacture of nutritional protein using a type of artificial photosynthesis. The animal feed industry is the primary driver of high demand for large volumes of nutritional protein, which is also suitable for use in meat substitute products.          A group led by Prof. Volker Sieber at the TUM Campus Straubing for Biotechnology and Sustainability (TUMCS) has succeeded in producing the amino acid L-alanine, an essential building block in proteins, from the environmentally harmful gas CO2.Their indirect biotechnological process involves methanol as an intermediate. Until now, protein for animal feed has been typically produced in the southern hemisphere with large-scale agricultural space requirements and negative consequences for biodiversity. The paper is published in the journal Chem Catalysis.The CO2, which is removed from the atmosphere, is first turned into methanol using green electricity and hydrogen. The new method converts this intermediate into L-alanine in a multi-stage process using synthetic enzymes; the method is extremely effective and generates very high yields. L-alanine is one of the most important components of protein, which is essential to the nutrition of both humans and animals.Prof. Sieber, of the TUM Professorship for Chemistry of Biogenic Resources, explains, \"Compared to growing plants, this method requires far less space to create the same amount of L-alanine, when the energy used comes from solar or wind power sources. The more efficient use of space means a kind of artificial photosynthesis can be used to produce the same amount of foodstuffs on significantly fewer acres. This paves the way for a smaller ecological footprint in agriculture.\"The manufacture of L-alanine is only the first step for the scientists. \"We also want to produce other amino acids from CO2 using renewable energy and to further increase efficiency in the realization process,\" says co-author Vivian Willers, who developed the process as a doctoral candidate at the TUM Campus Straubing. The researchers add that the project is a good example of how bioeconomy and hydrogen economy in combination can make it possible to achieve more sustainability.

  "text": "David Needham, professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke University, has demonstrated that a metabolic inhibiting drug called niclosamide, traditionally used to treat gut parasites, can readily be extracted and dissolved from commercial tablets in quantities sufficient to create throat and nasal sprays.          Combined with previous research that shows niclosamide might be able to prevent or inhibit the growth cycle of common respiratory viruses\u2014including COVID-19\u2014the results may point toward an easier pathway through the testing, regulatory approval and manufacturing processes needed to bring a potential product to market.The research was published online April 14 in the journal American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists Open (AAPS Open).\"These results show a potentially more rapid route to FDA approval, bringing a new commercial opportunity that could make the nasal sprays more readily available worldwide,\" Needham said. \"This would not just potentially be for COVID-19, but also for all respiratory viruses including Influenza and Respiratory Syncytia Virus (RSV) and to increase our preparedness for the next pandemic that seems sure to be coming down the pipe.\"Since 1958, niclosamide has been used to treat gut parasite infections in humans as well as pets and farm animals. Delivered as oral tablets, the drug kills the parasites on contact by inhibiting their crucial metabolic pathway and shutting down their energy supply.In recent years, however, researchers have been testing niclosamide's potential to treat a much wider range of diseases, such as many types of cancer, metabolic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis. Recent laboratory studies in cells have also shown the drug to be a potent antiviral medication, inhibiting a virus's ability to cause disease by targeting the energy supply of the host cell that the virus co-opts for its self-replication.                David Needham works at a lab bench to create anti-COVID throat and nasal sprays from commercial niclosamide. Credit: Duke University             Needham showed in 2022 that the drug could be dissolved into high enough concentrations to create a potential throat or nasal spray by a simple change in the solution's pH. This was an important result, as researchers had previously believed the drug to be too insoluble to form such solutions.      Needham is now working with colleagues Zachary Kelleher in the lab of Christina Barkauskas, assistant professor of medicine in pulmonary medicine at Duke, to evaluate how niclosamide brings down the available energy in human nasal and bronchial cells. The team is also working to show that niclosamide is safe at concentrations above those where it has been found in the literature to prevent viral infection. They are now testing the effects of niclosamide in the Duke Regional Biocontainment Laboratory to see if it can prevent infection in more respiratory-relevant cells.\"Academic papers and companies actively involved in potential niclosamide products were automatically invoking much more complex formulations,\" Needham said. \"I showed that you could raise the solubility to what you would want for this spray-style application.\"Because the tablets are already FDA approved, the spray solution formulation seemed set for a straightforward approval and launch into a safety-efficacy clinical trial. However, the FDA viewed this throat/nasal spray as a new formulation that needed to be tested from square one, despite its concentrations being millions of times lower than the oral tablets that have been approved for more than 50 years.By showing that enough niclosamide can be extracted from this already-approved formulation, Needham is hoping to expedite the testing and approval process.\"Having laid out the way to make the throat/nasal spray solutions by the simplest of techniques and showing that it can be readily scaled up to liters of volumes, my hope is that one or more companies will recognize not only the commercial opportunity, but also that this is the right thing to do to save lives and reduce suffering across the planet,\" Needham said.Moving forward, Needham is working to optimize these niclosamide-based solutions with an additional depot of dissolvable solid microparticles of niclosamide so that the throat and nasal tissue is continually supplied with safe concentrations of the drug. He's also looking to engage public labs, companies, institutes and governments to make and test the formulations.

  "answer_squad": " SARS-CoV-2",
  "text": "Scientists from the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry in Prague have deciphered the structure of the protein methyltransferase from the monkeypox virus. It is with the help of this protein that the virus escapes human immunity and causes the monkeypox disease. Based on this discovery, they have prepared substances that can block the function of methyltransferase.          The results of this research may constitute the first step towards creating a completely new group of antivirals. This applies not only to monkeypox, but also to diseases caused by other viruses, including COVID-19 induced by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.An article on the results of the work of the scientific groups led by Dr. Ev\u017een Bou\u0159a and Dr. Radim Nencka has now been published in Nature Communications. Both teams have for many years been studying viruses that cause serious diseases. In the past, they focused on the Zika virus from the flavivirus group or the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the coronavirus group.Like other viruses, the monkeypox virus multiplies in a host cell. For it to defend itself against external attack, it needs to recognize which RNA molecules are its own and which are not. \"Native RNA molecules carry a special marker called a cap for easier recognition. An unmarked molecule triggers an innate antiviral immunity response in infected cells. Therefore, viruses try to deceive the human body and, for example, the monkeypox virus confuses it by also adding a cap to its RNA,\" explains Ev\u017een Bou\u0159a.The symptoms of monkeypox resemble those of smallpox, a disease that has already been eradicated. Until recently, the virus causing it was found only in Central and Western Africa. Its natural reservoirs reside in rodents and primates. In humans it can cause a disease with an estimated mortality rate of 3% to 6%. While this is less than in the case of smallpox, it is much higher than, for example, with COVID-19.Recently, the monkeypox virus has spread worldwide, so it is no wonder that not only experts, but also the general population and public authorities are nervously watching the threat of another global viral pandemic. \"Our colleagues perfectly combine structural biology and cutting-edge medicinal chemistry. Thanks to that, we are closer to discovering new antivirals,\" says Prof. Jan Konvalinka, the director of IOCB Prague.

  "text": "Two notable metal oxide structures, spinel-type oxide and solid solution-type oxide, are widely used in Oxide-Zeolite (OXZEO) bifunctional catalysts for CO/CO2 hydrogenation reactions.          Identifying the crystallographic structure sensitivity of catalysts in chemical reactions is helpful to the rational design of catalysts. However, direct and convincing study to correlate the crystal structure of oxide to its catalytic performance has yet to be done.Recently, a joint research team led by Prof. Bao Xinhe, Prof. Pan Xiulian, Assoc. Prof. Jiao Feng and Prof. Xiao Jianping from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has observed strong crystal phase-dependent activity of MnGaOx in direct syngas conversion. This study was published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition on April 18.\"The main challenge to observing the crystal structure of oxide is the lack of a well-defined material-synthesis method to obtain metal oxides with the same element components but different crystallographic structures,\" said Jiao.In this study, the researchers found co-precipitation method and hydrothermal method could synthesize bimetallic oxides, which were composed of amorphous MnO2 and Ga2O3 with hexagonal close-packed (HCP) or Face centered-cubic (FCC) crystal phase, respectively. More interestingly, they found that the HCP oxide remained unchanged as HCP MnO-Ga2O3 solid solution oxides after reduction under H2 or CO, while the FCC solid solution oxide transformed into FCC spinel structure, where reduced Mn2+ took the A-site of AB2O4 spinel structure.They obtained 40% CO conversion, 81% light olefins selectivity, and 0.17 g\u00b7gcat-1\u00b7h-1 space-time yield of light olefins with the combination of FCC MnGaOx-Spinel and SAPO-18. In comparison, they obtained a much inferior activity with solid solution MnGaOx with a similar chemical composition.They further proved that the superior activity of MnGaOx-Spinel was attributed to its higher reducibility and the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ site, which facilitated the dissociation of the C-O bond via a more efficient ketene-acetate pathway to light olefins.\"Our findings may further optimize metal oxides for OXZEO syngas conversion,\" said Prof. Pan.

  "text": "As the proverb goes, it takes a village to raise a child. It can also take a village to make progress in science and medicine.          In this case, labs from not one, not two, but three departments in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School, along with a colleague in France, came together to figure out the structure of a tricky receptor involved in heart, lung, liver, and kidney function as well as pregnancy.Untangling this structure, described April 20 in Nature Chemical Biology, provides a foundation for developing drugs that act on the receptor with the goal of treating heart disease and conditions marked by the buildup of scar tissue, or fibrosis. Those include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic disease of the lungs; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; and scleroderma, which affects the skin, joints, and internal organs.The work may also pique the interest of other scientists who study basic biology because the receptor has an unusual structure that stands out from other members of its family, the G protein-coupled receptors.\"This was a very difficult receptor to characterize,\" said senior author Andrew Kruse, HMS professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology. \"The collaboration of multiple labs was essential, and the project highlights the value of combining experimental and computational methods.\"\"You have a lot of great opportunities at HMS to work with talented scientists who use different techniques than you,\" agreed Sarah Erlandson, who led the work as a graduate student in the Kruse lab. \"That allowed us to form a more complete picture of the receptor and study it in more ways than we could by ourselves.\"A relaxin possibilityThe receptor's name is a mouthful: relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1, or RXFP1. It gets that name because it and its three receptor siblings bind to hormones called relaxins.Relaxins are best known for initiating a constellation of changes in the body during pregnancy, including relaxing ligaments in the pelvis in preparation for childbirth. It also boosts sperm movement. But scientists have grown to appreciate the hormone's many non-reproductive roles as well, including dilating blood vessels to increase blood flow, stimulating the growth of new blood vessels, breaking down collagen, and reducing inflammation and fibrosis.Relaxins do all of this when they get released from tissues such as the heart, prostate, and placenta and bind to receptors in the membranes of cells in certain organs. The receptors then send signals that spur the cells to act.Most relaxins stay local, but one type, relaxin-2, travels throughout the body via the blood. This is the relaxin that binds to RXFP1.Relaxin-2's involvement in so many bodily processes has turned scientists' eyes toward treating diseases by mimicking higher or lower levels of the hormone. Doing so requires designing drugs that bind to RXFP1\u2014which is hard to do without knowing its structure.\"There are no drugs available that target this receptor,\" said Erlandson, who now works as a research scientist at Takeda Pharmaceuticals. \"People are interested in it as an option for treatment of cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases, but when you don't understand the detailed structure, it limits your ability to target it.\"So, the teams got to work.      It takes two to tango, four to solve a receptor structureThe Kruse lab took the first step by using cryo-electron microscopy to reveal what RXFP1 looks like at the near-atomic level when bound to relaxin-2.But one blurry spot remained where a flexible part of the receptor kept changing position from one snapshot to the next. That elusive part was the most important one\u2014the part that binds to relaxin.Members of the lab of Steven Gygi, HMS professor of cell biology, tackled the problem using mass spectrometry, a different method for determining structural information that measures atomic weights. Combining the experimental cryo-EM results with the mass spectrometry data allowed Erlandson to fill in the missing structural details.Now the researchers could see the receptor in its active, or \"on,\" state, bound to relaxin-2. The structure suggested that the receptor could turn itself on. If that were true, what prevented it from being on all the time, sending cell-activation signals whether relaxin was there or not?Insight came from Debora Marks, HMS associate professor of systems biology, and Xiaojing Cong at the Institute of Functional Genomics (IGF) in France. They used computational techniques\u2014including one called evolutionary coupling analysis, which looks at protein sequences that change together over time\u2014to predict how different parts of the receptor might shift around between its active and inactive states.At last, the story revealed itself.When RXFP1 is alone, no relaxins in sight, it's turned off. When relaxin-2 binds to it, multiple parts of the receptor change shape and communicate with one another to flip the \"on\" switch.The collaboration allowed the team to answer open questions about how RXFP1's multiple parts move around and work together to allow the receptor to do its job. The way it binds to relaxin-2 hasn't been seen in many of its receptor relatives.With RXFP1's active structure in hand, researchers now have a lock to design therapeutic keys for.\"It was really exciting to get to the point in the project where we saw the structure and were making these discoveries,\" said Erlandson. \"There's more work to be done, but this makes a big contribution that benefits scientists and could ultimately help patients.\"Additional authors are Shaun Rawson, James Osei-Owusu, Kelly P.

  "text": "In agriculture and medicine, isothiourea compounds play an important role as an important synthetic intermediate. As well as being potent inhibitors of biological targets, isothioureas can be used as organocatalysts or ligands in transition metal catalysis.          In a study published in the journal Green Synthesis and Catalysis, a group of researchers from China outlines a new electrocatalytic three-component reaction method for the synthesis of isothioureas.Multicomponent reactions have advantages over classical methods, such as operational simplicity, economical steps, avoidance of cumbersome purification process, energy efficiency, and minimization of waste generation. Among the reported methods for the synthesis of isothioureas by multi-component reactions, sulfur source is limited, with the reliance of reactions on heavy metal catalysts or stoichiometric oxidants.In order to solve the existing problems, the team led by Professors Yingming Pan and Haitao Tang from the School of Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Guangxi Normal University found that when thiols, isocyanides and amines are used as substrates, isothiourea derivatives can be synthesized through free radicals under electrochemical conditions.Notably, this reaction process does not need heavy metal catalysis and stoichiometric oxidants and has the advantages of wide substrate applicability, good functional group tolerance and high atomic economy.Using this new approach, isothioureas were synthesized by oxidation of thiophenols with different substituents to sulfur radicals under electrochemical conditions using isocyanides with various reactive sites as substrates.\"When isocyanides were attacked by radicals, they formed imine carbon radical active intermediates, and reacted with aniline to synthesize isothioureas,\" explained Pan. \"The synthesis strategy of more complex isothioureas was constructed by controlling the formation of iminocarbon radical active intermediates from isocyanides by the electrochemical method.\"According to Muxue He, a researcher involved in this study, this is a major breakthrough in the construction of isothiourea derivatives through multi-component reactions. \"So far, multicomponent construction of isothioureas has required the use of heavy metal catalysts and stoichiometric oxidants. Our method shows that these reagents can be avoided by means of electrochemical synthesis.\"\"We hope that our results will encourage scientists to continue to investigate facile and efficient synthetic strategies for isothioureas,\" added Tang.

  "text": "Hair styling can be a potent form of self-expression, whether it features dramatic updos, intricate braids or crazy colors. Beyond being a reflection of our personality, these strands contain compounds that could one day appear in bandages, sunscreens or other products. Researchers reporting in ACS Omega have now designed a simple, green process to extract both keratin and melanin from human hair for these possible applications without harsh chemicals or excessive waste.          Hair is made up of protein filaments consisting of many different layers and components. Its structure comes from the protein keratin, which can also be found in fingernails, horns and feathers. Its color is provided by melanin, a group of pigment molecules that are also found in the skin and eyes. In addition, melanin has antioxidative properties and can help shield against ultraviolet light.These qualities make the compounds suitable for biomedical applications; however, since most discarded hair is incinerated or dumped in landfills, its keratin and melanin are largely unused as well. Chemically extracting them from hair is possible, but current protocols either can only extract one compound at a time, or rely on harsh chemicals and complicated steps. So, Paulomi Ghosh and colleagues wanted to develop a straightforward method to extract both keratin and melanin from human hair with a single procedure, using a recyclable, green solvent.The researchers collected samples of hair from local salons, then washed and cut them into small slices. Then, they mixed the hair with an ionic liquid, which dissolved the mixture by interrupting the hydrogen bonds that held the keratin proteins together. When heated and poured into a hydrochloric acid solution, the melanin pigments precipitated out and were collected. Next, the researchers performed dialysis to collect the keratin proteins. The ionic liquid was recycled and reused in subsequent reactions, without a significant impact on the reaction's yield.Recovered keratin was compatible with blood, suggesting that it could be used in heavy-duty hemostatic bandages. This extraction procedure also maintained the natural structure of the melanin, which was lost in other, harsher methods. Because the melanin had good antioxidative and UV shielding properties, the team says it could be used in sun-protective products or films. The researchers say that this technique could serve as a green way to sustainably extract useful biopolymers from otherwise discarded materials.

  "text": "Scripps Research scientists have developed a new strategy for identifying small molecules that can change the function of proteins, offering a promising path for discovering targeted drugs. In collaboration with scientists at other institutions, the group used their new approach to find small molecules that can alter the activity of proteins involved in cancer.          The research, published in Molecular Cell on April 20, improves on previous methods that could screen for whether small molecules selectively attached to proteins, but not whether they affected the proteins' biological activities. The new method revolves around using two mirror-image versions of a small molecule and comparing how they change the size of protein complexes in cells.\"The ability of small molecules to specifically bind to a protein and cause a biological consequence is the fundamental basis for most drugs today,\" says senior author Benjamin Cravatt, Ph.D., Gilula Chair of Chemical Biology at Scripps Research. \"With this assay, we're expanding our ability to discover these small molecules that not only bind proteins, but have functional impacts.\"In recent years, Cravatt's lab has designed sets of small chemicals that can irreversibly bind to certain parts of proteins. However, screening these chemical libraries to discover their possible impact on protein function was generally a slow and tedious process. Since individual proteins have different roles in cell biology, researchers often have to develop specialized functional screens for each protein of interest. One screen, for instance, might determine whether the chemicals affected cell growth, while another might determine whether the chemicals changed levels of a different molecule.\"Just because a small molecule engages a protein physically doesn't mean that it changes the protein's function in the cell,\" says co-first author Jarrett Remsberg, Ph.D., who carried out the work as an American Cancer Society postdoctoral research fellow in the Cravatt lab at Scripps Research. Former graduate student Michael Lazear, Ph.D. and postdoctoral fellow Martin Jaeger, Ph.D. were also first authors of the paper.In the new work, Cravatt's group used the conglomeration of proteins into complexes as a proxy for their function. Proteins often work by binding to other proteins\u2014if this binding doesn't happen or if it is induced to happen, it indicates a protein's function may have changed.The research team designed pairs of \"mirror image\" molecules, called stereoisomers, that could each bind irreversibly to proteins in the same way that their previous chemical libraries had worked. The pairs of stereoisomers let them be sure that the impact of each small molecule was due to its unique structure (if only one version of a molecule changes the proteins' function, it is likely a specific and direct interaction).      Once they exposed cells to the pairs of stereoisomers, they tested whether a protein-of-interest was in a different size complex, using a technique called size exclusion chromatography in which proteins are sifted through beads with different sized pores.To show the utility of this approach, the researchers screened the set of small molecules for their ability to change the sizes of protein complexes in prostate cancer cells. They pinpointed a molecule, MY-1B, which selectively disrupted a complex of proteins known as PA28, previously found to play a role in degrading proteins in cancer. Further work in leukemia cells confirmed that, by specifically binding to the protein PMSE1, MY-1B or a related compound (but not their mirror images) could effectively inactivate the PA28 complex.Cravatt and colleagues also followed up on an observation that a different chemical, EV-96, changed the size of a protein complex involved in splicing strands of RNA inside cells. The team discovered that EV-96 slowed the growth of cancer cells and pinpointed SF3B1 as the protein the chemical was binding to.In both cases, the new chemicals represent the first time scientists have been able to target the protein complexes\u2014PA28 and the so-called spliceosome\u2014 with small, simple synthetic chemicals.\"This means that researchers have new chemical tools in their arsenal that they didn't have before,\" says Remsberg. \"It's an opportunity for better understanding these proteins as well as investigating potential therapeutic opportunities.\"The team hopes their approach can be expanded to use other functional readouts than complex size, and they intend to use it to study different cell types in the future.\"The long-term idea is that we can use this approach to discover chemical compounds that impinge upon any readout,\" says Cravatt. \"There are certainly other readouts that we hope to be able to look at in the future.\" More information:Michael R.

  "answer_squad": " electrified spatiotemporal heating",
  "text": "A team of engineers and materials scientists affiliated with multiple institutions in the U.S., has developed a new way to depolymerize plastics using electrified spatiotemporal heating. In their paper, published in the journal Nature, the group describes the new process and its efficiency. Nature has also published a Research Briefing in the same journal issue outlining the work done by the team.          Over the past several years, plastic pollution has become a major concern, both for the environment and for the health of plants and animals, including humans, and scientists are seeking ways to recycle it. Most of the techniques developed thus far involve using chemicals to depolymerize plastics. These efforts are still extremely inefficient, however, with yields between 10% and 25%. In this new effort, the team has found a way to use pulsed electricity to boost the yield to approximately 36%.The approach involved designing a new kind of reactor with a porous carbon felt bilayer and a pulsed electric heater at the top. In their reactor, plastic bits are melted as they are fed in to the upper chamber and flow as a mass into a lower chamber, where the material is pushed through the felt filter. The plastic then begins to decompose as the temperature rises. As the molecules that make up the plastic become smaller, their volatility grows until they are expelled from the reactor as a gas, which allows more liquid to be drawn in. Using electricity to heat the plastic allows for oscillating the temperature, allowing simpler depolymerization reactions to take precedence over side reactions, which need additional heating to depolymerize.In addition to improving efficiency, the new approach uses less energy because of the oscillating instead of constant heat source. The team notes the system could be made more eco-friendly by using renewable sources for the electricity. They note that their reactor does emit other materials, such as acetylene, methane and some larger molecules, along with some aromatics. They also acknowledge that more work is required to reduce the amount of carbon released during the reactions.

  "text": "Powder thermal diffusion alloying is an important surface strengthening method that can fabricate an anticorrosion coating on magnesium alloys.       The diffusion time for most diffusion alloying processes varies from tens of minutes to hours. Meanwhile, it is hard to tell whether the diffusion source has already failed or not in the end of the diffusion alloying process.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Huang Yanliang from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS) has determined the effective time of a diffusion source that contains 10 g ZnO and 1 g NH4Cl at 400 \u2103. Surprisingly, the effective time of such a diffusion source can be longer than 150 hours.The study was published in the Journal of Materials Research and Technology.Results showed that a looser and purer diffusion source and a better air tightness of the crucible could help to prolong the effective time of the diffusion source. A longer preheating time of the diffusion source was preferred for the fabrication of a thicker Zn-rich diffusion alloyed coating in the first diffusion alloying process.                The as obtained Zn-rich coatings fabricated on Mg alloy specimens after the first diffusion alloying process with a pre-sintering time of 25 h, 50 h, 75 h, 100 h and 125 h for the diffusion source. All the photographs share the same scale bar at the lower right corner. Credit: IOCAS             Continuous consumption of the active phase at elevated temperatures leads to the failure of the diffusion source. Our work proved that such an inactive diffusion source could be reactivated by adding new NH4Cl powder,\" said Prof. Huang.\"Clarification of the effective time of the diffusion source at elevated temperatures in this work is quite meaningful to save powder materials as well as optimize the diffusion alloying operation in related industries,\" said Dr. Lu Dongzhu, first author and corresponding author of the study.

  "text": "Human lives have been revolutionized since lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) were successfully commercialized. However, modern portable electronics have increased energy demands and thus require batteries with high energy density. Directly using Li metal as an anode is considered a promising strategy due to its ultra-high capacity (3860 mA h g-1) and low negative electrochemical potential (- 3.04 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode).          However, using Li metal is currently not possible due to unsatisfactory cyclability, serious safety issues, and poor rate capability. A particularly important issue is the formation of a weak solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The SEI layer is formed when Li metal reacts with the electrolyte. Owing to its instability, the SEI layer often breaks down because of the large volume variation of lithium metal.The breakdown of SEI leads to the exposure of unreacted Li, which subsequently reacts with liquid electrolytes to form more SEI and thereby causes cell failure during the cycling process. Additionally, uneven nucleation and the forming of needle-like Li dendrites are other key issues restricting the use of Li metal as anodes. These result from increased local current density and eventually pierce the separator causing safety concerns. It is necessary to develop an effective strategy to inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites.Recently, Prof. Zhifeng Zheng's team from Xiamen University published a manuscript entitled \"Homogenous metallic deposition regulated by abundant lithiophilic sites in nickel/cobalt oxides nanoneedle arrays for lithium metal batteries\" in Journal of Energy Chemistry.Rock salt type NiO and CoO nanoneedle arrays were grown on lignin-derived carbon film to achieve reversible lithium stripping/plating cycling under high current density. The rational structure of the 3D networks plays an important role in promoting homogeneous Li-ion flux and alleviating local current density.The abundant lithiophilic sites in the film inhibit the Li dendritic growth and \"dead\" Li formation. Uniform bottom-up Li deposition can be facilitated by the unique three\u2013dimensional nanoneedle arrays. Because of its unique structure, the NCO-CNF electrode displayed stable lithium stripping/plating cycling up to 4000 h.Furthermore, the bottom of the unique structure has the strongest lithiophilic properties, followed by the surface of the nanoneedles and the surrounding channel. A NCO-CNF/Li|LFP full cell with an N/P ratio of three exhibits impressive reversibility at 0.5 C up to 80 cycles. In conclusion, the study proposes a rational strategy for designing lithiophilic substrates to induce homogenous metallic deposition, which is a potentially useful method for mitigating the dendrite issues in next-generation lithium metal batteries.

  "text": "Ion-transport membranes are vital components of clean-energy technologies, such as CO2 electrolyzers, water electrolyzers, fuel cells, redox flow batteries and ion-capture electrodialysis. These membranes must screen out specific substances to prevent crossover while efficiently conducting specific ions.          Polymer materials have the advantages of low cost, manufacturing scalability and small footprint, and thus dominate the use of ion-transport membranes in practical modules. However, the existing polymer membranes suffer from a ubiquitous \"conductivity-selectivity\" trade-off: highly conductive membranes tend to exhibit low selectivity and vice versa. This trade-off presents a challenge in developing membrane materials that meet the required performance criteria.In a study published in Nature on April 26, the research team led by Professor Xu Tongwen and Professor Yang Zhengjin from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and their collaborators, proposed a new type of ion exchange membrane\u2014triazine framework polymer membranes\u2014which can break the conductivity-selectivity trade-off.Compared to traditional materials, the triazine framework polymer membranes exhibited much enhanced capacity in both anti-swelling and anti-aging, showing an extremely low swelling ratio on water absorption. Their rigid channels ensured high selectivity from size-sieving, thus enabling extremely low permeability of active materials.Credit: Chinese Academy of SciencesWith proper control over the chemistry of rigid pore channels, the researchers observed near-frictionless ion flow within the all-rigid triazine framework polymer membrane (SCTF-BP), with the ion diffusion coefficient close to value in water. This is achieved by the robust micropore confinement within the rigid pore channels and multi-interaction between ion and membrane.These framework membranes exhibited both extremely low permeability of active materials and ultrahigh ion diffusivity, and their advantages were exemplified as ion-conducting membranes in 2,6-dihydroxy anthraquinone / K4[Fe(CN)6] aqueous organic redox flow batteries. The membrane delivered a neat area-specific resistance as low as 0.17 \u03a9 cm2, and thus enabled stable cell operation at extreme current densities, from 200 to 500 mA cm-2, with both high energy efficiency and high-capacity utilization.These data related to energy efficiency and capacity utilization far surpass those for otherwise identical cells assembled with commercial membranes and state-of-the-art ion-sieving membranes.This work highlights the importance of secondary interactions to develop high-performing ion-transport membranes. The design strategy proposed is believed to be broadly applicable, considering numerous options of organic reactions and functional monomers that can be utilized to construct polymer frameworks, and directs the fit-for-purpose design of membranes according to practical application demand.

  "answer_squad": " Capacitive deionization",
  "text": "As freshwater scarcity affects millions worldwide, scientists and engineers have looked for new ways of filtering unwanted metals and minerals out of water while retaining those elements for re-use elsewhere.          Capacitive deionization (CDI), a technology in which a membrane made from electrode materials removes metal ions from water, has proved a promising technique for such next-generation water filters. Researchers from University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory envisioned the technique could be made even more efficient if they modified the molecular surface of the electrodes.With support from University of Chicago's Joint Task Force Initiative, three researchers investigated the best way to alter these surfaces. Junhong Chen, Crown Family Professor of Molecular Engineering at UChicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and Lead Water Strategist at Argonne, collaborated with two Argonne colleagues: scientist Maria Chan and senior physicist Chris Benmore. Using experimentation, machine learning, and powerful X-rays, they developed a CDI device that adsorbed lead much more efficiently than before.\"Our future economy and national security really depend on the availability of clean water,\" Chen said. \"The only way to really address this water challenge is to look into the re-use of water. This could potentially drive the recovery of resources that are important for clean energy applications and move us toward a circle economy for our society.\"Finding the best functional molecular groupsCreating such a device could have wide-ranging implications. It could help remove lead from water to create safer drinking water, and it could help with the re-use of water by trapping phosphorus and lithium from a water supply, then releasing the phosphorus for use in fertilizer and the lithium for use in clean energy technologies.Current technologies don't have the ability to selectively separate trace amounts of different ions within water, or can only do so at high cost. While some technologies can separate metals, they cannot fully distinguish one kind of metal ion from another. This is important, since while lead should be removed from drinking water, another metal, calcium, should be left in water, since it is beneficial for human health.Credit: Argonne National LaboratoryCDIs have shown promise in removing selected metal ions by using carbon materials like graphene oxide in their electrodes. To improve these devices, the UChicago-Argonne team needed to better understand the interaction between molecules and ions at the surface of the device's electrodes.Using modeling and machine learning, Chan and her team worked to understand how altering functional molecular groups\u2014specific groups of atoms that have their own characteristics\u2014on the electrode surface would affect the selectivity and removal of metal ions.\"Using computer models, we can understand and select functional groups at a molecular level. Using machine learning models, and we can broaden the search to a number of different molecules that are potentially viable,\" Chan said.The team ultimately found functional groups that could attach to the graphene oxide as well as selectively adsorb different types of ions from the water. Their predictions were experimentally validated by Chen, showing that the device could much more efficiently remove lead from water with these new functional groups.At Argonne, Benmore used the powerful Advanced Photon Source, a high-energy X-ray, to understand the structure of lead in water samples and better understand the interaction between the CDI and the lead. \"These were based on experiments done back in the 80s, and no one has really studied ions in water since, so we were really able to pick up on a lot of very old but important work and really apply new methods towards it,\" he said.Next the team plans to test its device using other metal ions, including lithium and cobalt. The project benefitted from early funding from UChicago Joint Task Force Initiative, which helps Argonne and Fermilab achieve mission success by opening channels of frequent communication and collaboration across institutions.\"The UChicago Joint Task Force Initiative support has been critical for this research project,\" Chen said. \"I think this project has fostered collaboration between UChicago and Argonne researchers, which is really very impactful because we are going to work together for this project as well as future projects.\" Provided byUniversity of ChicagoCitation:New technology more efficiently removes heavy metals from water (2023, April 27)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-technology-efficiently-heavy-metals.html  This document is subject to copyright.

But it is still challenging to construct a microbial cell factory for methanol-based bioproduction due to the toxicity of methanol and its complex cellular metabolism.       Recently, a research group led by Prof. Zhou Yongjin from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has engineered yeast Ogataea polymorpha for efficient production of fatty alcohols from sole methanol by coupling peroxisomal metabolism.The study was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on March 13.Fatty alcohols are widely used as detergents, emulsifiers, and emollients in personal care products, such as soaps, shampoos and creams. Microbial production from methanol might provide an efficient and sustainable route for supplying fatty alcohols. However, due to the toxicity of methanol and formaldehyde (the oxidative intermediate of methanol), the overproduction of fatty alcohols in microbial cell factories is hindered.In this study, the researchers observed compromised fatty alcohol production when constructing the cytosolic biosynthesis pathway in the methylotrophic yeast Ogataea polymorpha. The peroxisomal compartmentalization improved fatty alcohol production by coupling the cellular metabolism and product biosynthesis.Furthermore, the enhancing supply of precursor and cofactor in peroxisome improved the cellular fitness and enabled high-level production of fatty alcohol (up to 3.6 g/L).\"This work provides a feasible engineering strategy to improve methanol biotransformation toward sustainable production of fatty alcohols,\" said Prof. Zhou.

  "text": "Artificial intelligence can generate poems and essays, create responsive game characters, analyze vast amounts of data and detect patterns that the human eye might miss. Imagine what AI could do for drug discovery, traditionally a time-consuming, expensive process from the bench to the bedside.          Experts see great promise in a complementary approach using AI and structure-based drug discovery, a computational method that relies on knowledge of 3D structures of biological targets.We recently caught up with Vsevolod \"Seva\" Katritch, associate professor of quantitative and computational biology and chemistry at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience. Katritch is the co-director of the Center for New Technologies in Drug Discovery and Development (CNT3D) at the USC Michelson Center and the lead author of a new review paper published in Nature. The paper, co-authored by USC research scientist Anastasiia Sadybekov, describes how computational approaches will streamline drug discovery.We're on the cusp of major advances in drug discovery. What brings us to this moment?There has been a seismic shift in computational drug discovery in the last few years: an explosion of data availability on clinically relevant, human-protein structures\u2014and molecules that bind them, enormous chemical libraries of drug-like molecules, almost unlimited computing power and new, more efficient computational methods. The newest excitement is about AI-based drug discovery, but what's even more powerful is a combination of AI and structure-based drug discovery, with both approaches synergistically complementing each other.How has drug discovery been done in the past?Traditional drug discovery is mostly a trial-and-error venture. It's slow and expensive, taking an average of 15 years and $2 billion. There's a high attrition rate at every step, from target selection to lead optimization. The most opportunities for time and cost savings reside in the earlier discovery and preclinical stages.      What takes place in the early stage?Let's use a lock-and-key analogy. The target receptor is the lock, and the drug that blocks or activates this receptor is a key for this lock. (Of course, the caveat is that in biology nothing is black or white, so some of the working keys switch the lock better than others, and lock is a bit malleable too.)Here's an example. Lipitor, the bestselling drug of all time, targets an enzyme involved in the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. A receptor on the enzyme is the lock. Lipitor is the key, fitting into the lock and blocking the activity of the enzyme, triggering a series of events that decrease blood levels of bad cholesterol.Now, computational approaches allow us to digitally model many billions and even trillions of virtual keys and predict which ones are likely to be good keys. Only a few dozen of the best candidate keys are chemically synthesized and tested.This sounds much more efficientIf the model is good, this process yields better results than traditional trial-and-error testing of millions of random keys. This reduces the physical requirements for synthesis of compounds and testing them more than thousandsfold, while often arriving at better results, as demonstrated by our work and work of many other groups working in this field.Can you explain the difference between the two main computational approaches, structure-based and AI-based?Following the lock-and-key analogy, the structure-based approach takes advantage of our detailed understanding of the lock's structure. If the 3D, physical structure of the lock is known, we can use virtual methods to predict the structure of a key that matches the lock.The machine learning, or AI-based approach, works best when many keys are already known for our target lock or other similar locks. AI can then analyze this mixture of similar locks and keys and predict the keys that are most likely to fit our target. It does not need exact knowledge of the lock structure, but it needs a large collection of relevant keys.Thus, the structure-based and AI-based approaches are applicable in different cases and complement each other.Are there any computational limits to this process?When testing billions and trillions of virtual compounds on cloud computers, computational costs themselves can become a bottleneck. A modular, giga-scale screening technology allows us to speed up and reduce cost dramatically by virtually predicting good parts of the key, combine them together, sort of building the key from several parts. For a 10 billion-compound library, this drops the computational costs from millions of dollars to hundreds, and it allows further scale-ups to trillions of compounds. More information:Anastasiia V.

  "answer_squad": " Ammonia",
  "text": "Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most widely produced chemicals in the world, with production at more than 187 million tons in 2020. About 85% of it is used to produce nitrogenous fertilizers, while the rest is used for refining petroleum, manufacturing a wide range of other chemicals, and creating synthetic fibers such as nylon. However, all this comes at a high energy cost.          Currently, most of the ammonia is produced using the conventional Haber-Bosch process, which requires combining nitrogen and hydrogen at high temperatures (400\u2013450\u00b0C) and pressures (200 atmospheres). As a result, scientists are actively seeking catalysts that can reduce the energy requirements for ammonia production and make synthesis more sustainable.Ruthenium (Ru), a noble metal, has been the primary candidate in this regard owing to its exceptional ability to absorb nitrogen at low temperatures. However, its high cost has prevented its widespread adoption in large-scale ammonia synthesis. While cobalt (Co) has been considered as a more cost-effective alternative, achieving the same catalytic activity as Ru at low temperatures has been difficult.To enhance the catalytic activity of Co, a team of researchers including Professor Masaaki Kitano at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan developed, in a recent study, a support material for Co nanoparticles. The material, a barium-containing oxyhydride electride called BaAl2O4-xHy, increases the catalytic activity of Co to a level comparable to that of Ru catalysts at low temperatures, and protects the H- ions and electrons from the effects of air and moisture. The breakthrough was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\"We attempted to develop a barium-containing oxyhydride electride, Ba2Al2O4-xHy to obtain a highly effective and chemically durable catalyst and unlock a new approach to designing novel inorganic electride materials and triggering their application in other fields,\" explains Prof. Kitano.How did the team achieve this feat? Put simply, BaAl2O4-xHy has a unique structure that promotes the dissociation of nitrogen over Co. The material exhibits a stuffed tridymite structure where AlO4 tetrahedra are linked to form a three-dimensional (3D) network structure, creating cage-like void spaces between the barium ions. These interstitial sites are like pockets for holding negative charges, enabling the material to donate electrons to Co and facilitate the breakdown of nitrogen molecules into nitrogen adatoms.To improve the electron-donating ability of the material, the researchers introduced electrons to the interstitial sites by replacing the O2- lattice ions with H- ions (O2- (framework)+ \u00bd H2 = H- (framework) + 1/2 O2 + e- (cage)). The introduction of H- ions not only improved the electron-donating ability of the BaAl2O4 but also facilitated the desired reduction of nitrogen to ammonia.By promoting both the cleavage of N2 and its subsequent reduction to ammonia, the Co/Ba2Al2O4-xHy catalyst could produce more than 500 mmol of ammonia per gram of cobalt per hour, a record value for Co-based catalysts. Moreover, compared to conventional Co catalysts, which typically have activation energies for ammonia synthesis exceeding 100 kJ/mole, the proposed catalyst demonstrated an activation energy of just 48.9 kJ/mole.Further, the stuffed tridymite structure was durable and reusable, with the AlO4-based tetrahedra framework shielding the lattice H- ions and electrons from oxidation. Finally, after exposing the Co/BaAl2O4-xHy to air, the researchers could recover up to 95% of its original activity by simply heating it in hydrogen.With its good chemical stability, enhanced catalytic activity, and high reusability, the Co/BaAl2O4-xHy catalyst shows great promise for synthesizing ammonia at low temperatures. \"This novel inorganic electride offers a new approach to developing highly effective and stable Ru-free catalysts for green ammonia synthesis,\" concludes Prof. Kitano.

  "text": "Researchers at Tokyo Tech have discovered hidden chemical order of the Mo and Nb atoms in disordered Ba7Nb4MoO20, by combining state-of-the-art techniques, including resonant X-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. This study provides valuable insights into how a material's properties, such as ionic conduction, can be heavily influenced by its hidden chemical order. These results would stimulate significant advances in materials science and engineering.          Determining the precise structure of a crystalline solid is a challenging endeavor. Materials properties such as ion conduction and chemical stability, are heavily influenced by the chemical (occupational) order and disorder. However, the techniques that scientists typically use to elucidate unknown crystal structures suffer from serious limitations.For instance, X-ray and neutron diffraction methods are powerful techniques to reveal the atomic positions and arrangement in the crystal lattice. However, they may not be adequate for distinguishing different atomic species with similar X-ray scattering factors and similar neutron scattering lengths.To tackle this issue, a research team led by Professor Masatomo Yashima of Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) in Japan sought to develop a novel and more powerful approach to analyze the order and disorder in crystals. They combined four different techniques to analyze the crystal structure of an important ionic conductor, Ba7Nb4MoO20.\"We chose Ba7Nb4MoO20 as Ba7Nb4MoO20-based oxides and related compounds are a class of emerging materials with interesting properties such as high ionic conduction and high chemical stability,\" explains Prof. Yashima. \"However, given that both the Mo6+ and Nb5+ cations have similar scattering powers, all structural analyses of Ba7Nb4MoO20 until now have been performed assuming complete Mo/Nb disorder.\"As described in their recent paper published in Nature Communications, the researchers used an approach that combined two experimental techniques, resonant X-ray diffraction (RXRD) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) aided by computational calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The NMR provided direct experimental evidence that the Mo atoms occupy only the crystallographic M2 site in Ba7Nb4MoO20, indicating the chemical order of Mo atoms.Next, the researchers used RXRD to quantify the occupancy factors of Mo and Nb atoms. They found that the occupancy factor of Mo atoms was 0.5 at the M2 site but zero at all other sites. Interestingly, the M2 site is close to the oxide-ion conducting, oxygen-deficient layer of Ba7Nb4MoO20. This suggests that the Mo atoms at the M2 site have key role in the high ion conduction of Ba7Nb4MoO20. Furthermore, DFT calculations indicated that the Mo ordering stabilizes Mo excess composition exhibiting high ionic conductivity. Positions, occupancy, and atomic displacements of protons and oxide ions were also determined by neutron diffraction.\"Our results demonstrate that the Mo order affects the material properties of Ba7Nb4MoO20,\" says Prof. Yashima. \"In this regard, our work represents a major advance in our understanding of the correlation between the crystal structure and the material properties of ionic conductors.\" Further, in contrast to single-crystal X-ray and neutron diffraction, the proposed approach can even be extended to other polycrystalline and powdered samples.Overall, the methodology presented in this study can open up new avenues for an in-depth analysis of chemical order/disorder in materials. In turn, this could lead to the development of physics, chemistry, and materials science and technology.

  "text": "Ammonia has been in the news because of its suitability as a hydrogen carrier and fuel, in addition to being a vital ingredient in fertiliser. Existing distribution networks and the ease of turning ammonia gas into a liquid make ammonia a cost-effective way to transport renewable energy. For a given volume, ammonia\u2014a molecule made up of three hydrogen atoms and one nitrogen atom\u2014carries about 50% more hydrogen atoms than hydrogen itself.          As ammonia contains only hydrogen and nitrogen, it does not emit carbon dioxide when used. If made using green hydrogen (produced with renewable energy), its production also does not emit carbon dioxide. Therefore, green ammonia could help achieve a net-zero world, particularly as a fuel for long-haul transport and heavy industry.Australia is well placed to develop a major renewable hydrogen export industry, potentially using green ammonia. Proposed projects include Cape Hardy, Collinsville, Australian Renewable Energy Hub, HyNQ, H2Tas and Gibson Island.Unfortunately, just because ammonia doesn't contain carbon, that doesn't make it good for the environment. It's a source of nitrogen pollution, which has many damaging environmental impacts. Despite Australia's natural advantage in producing green ammonia, we ironically have the biggest per capita nitrogen footprint in the world.Rarely, though, do green ammonia proponents critically assess its environmental sustainability beyond net zero claims.      Exceeding planetary boundariesThe Stockholm Resilience Centre defines nine processes that regulate Earth to support life as we know it. The boundaries of a \"safe operating space\" have been defined for each process.You probably won't be surprised to know climate change is one of the boundaries we have exceeded. You could be forgiven for thinking it has been our biggest impact on the planet. But that \"honour\" goes to biogeochemical flows of nutrients, mostly as a result of nitrogen fertilisers.Why? Well it comes back to ammonia.                Green ammonia produced using renewable energy can be used for power generation, energy storage and transport, fuel and fertiliser. Credit: Source: The Davos Agenda/World Economic Forum, CC BY-NC-ND Unbalancing the nitrogen cycleNitrogen makes up 78% of our atmosphere as dinitrogen gas (N\u2082). However, in this form it is inaccessible to living organisms.To support life, nitrogen must be converted into reactive forms such as ammonia. Once it reaches ecosystems, ammonia undergoes a series of chemical transformations. Eventually it breaks up again into N\u2082, and the cycle can start over again.For millions of years, the processes in each step of the cycle have been in balance. However, industrial fertiliser production in the 20th century has thrown this cycle out of balance.On the upside, ammonia has been a miracle chemical for growing food. An estimated 3.5 billion people are being fed thanks to chemical fertilisers. This means almost half of the world's population would go hungry if not for synthetic ammonia.The downside is too much reactive nitrogen is ending up in the environment\u2014more than twice as much as the recommended planetary boundary.In the case of excess nitrogen, crossing its planetary boundary has already had huge consequences. It has led to deterioration of ecosystems, photochemical smog, acid rain and health problems such as respiratory illnesses and cancer, algal blooms leading to fish kills such as the recent one at Menindee Lakes, damage to the Great Barrier Reef, and greenhouse gases much more potent than carbon dioxide.Producing additional ammonia as a renewable energy carrier could make these problems even worse. A problem of leakage                The Stockholm Resilience Centre planetary boundaries. (BII stands for Biodiversity Intactness Index. E/MSY is the number of extinctions per million species-years, a common measure of extinction rates. P stands for phosphorus and N for nitrogen.) Credit: Source: Azote for Stockholm Resilience Centre, based on analysis in Wang-Erlandsson et al 2022, CC BY-NC-ND Some estimate ammonia supply chains leak it into the environment at rates as high as 6%. However, research is limited. More widely understood natural gas supply chains may provide a ballpark figure of around 2.6%.Replacing fossil fuels with ammonia for long-haul trucks and shipping might reduce the carbon footprint of transport (which accounts for 37% of total carbon dioxide emissions). Yet, if 2.6% of ammonia leaked from the supply chain, we estimate this could triple the reactive nitrogen flux, further overshooting the planetary boundary. At a 6% leakage rate, it could be four times.We all know how climate change has been changing our world\u2014and that is at \"only\" 1.2 times the carbon planetary boundary. Using green ammonia as a renewable energy carrier could have an even greater impact on the nitrogen planetary boundary.A complement to ammoniaAnother renewable energy carrier can be made from green hydrogen: methanol. It's a molecule of four hydrogen atoms and single carbon and oxygen atoms.Like ammonia, methanol can be used as a fuel. It could replace petrochemical feedstocks used in industrial processes and manufacturing. Our research shows methanol could also enable biotechnology to better integrate with industrial processes.More significantly, methanol doesn't affect the nitrogen cycle. As long as it is made using a renewable source of carbon, such as carbon dioxide from direct air capture, there is a net zero impact on the environment. International Energy Agency projections show the United States has a greater emphasis on green methanol, while Australia and Europe are more focused on green ammonia.Environmental sustainability means more than net zero. In the case of green ammonia, holistic thinking is needed so we don't solve one problem only to make another worse.

  "text": "A versatile new foam material developed by researchers at the University of Georgia could significantly reduce health care-related infections caused by implanted medical devices\u2014or drastically improve cleanup efforts following environmental disasters like oil spills.          This research, titled \"Superhydrophobic and Conductive Foams with Antifouling and Oil-Water Separation Properties\" was published in the ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces January issue.Like a spongy Swiss Army knife, the porous three-dimensional foam is water-repellent\u2014meaning it resists blood, microbes and proteins, while also exhibiting antimicrobial and oil-water separation properties. Its versatility, functionality and relatively inexpensive production costs could make it a valuable resource for future clinicians and environmental remediation professionals alike.\"Making a multifunctional and versatile surface is an extremely challenging task,\" said Hitesh Handa, an associate professor in UGA's School of Chemical, Materials and Biomedical Engineering. \"You can find a surface that is only antimicrobial, or you can find one that can only prevent blood clotting. To be able to fabricate materials that are anticlotting, antimicrobial and antifouling is a significant improvement on current standards.\"The material is a coarse foam with a pair of added fillers: hydrophobic (water-repellent) electrically conductive graphene nanoplatelets and hydrophobic bactericidal copper microparticles. In addition to repelling water, their inclusion created a coarse surface that facilitated high oil adsorption capacity and the copper, a known toxin to bacterial cells, added antimicrobial properties to the surface itself.Credit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2023). DOI: 10.1021/acsami.2c22180Studies of its effectiveness yielded positive results.Using E. coli as a test bacterium, researchers found that the material resulted in a 99.9% bacterial reduction over a simple polymer. While that doesn't mean that all bacteria had been removed from the solution, it is a significant improvement that Handa thinks could improve health outcomes for many of the more than 500,000 patients who endure health care-related infections from medical implants each year.\"Current medical devices are prone to contamination,\" Handa said. \"When you put any medical device into the body, proteins are the first thing to stick to a surface, and they act like a glue that allows blood or bacteria to adhere. So, if we can stop the protein adsorption, half the battle is won.\"      Likewise, a series of tests demonstrated the material's high capacity for separating water and other oil-based pollutants. By placing a 3D sponge made from this surface into a variety of water mixtures\u2014chloroform, hydrochloric acid and other organic particles\u2014researchers were able to show its ability to absorb and remove the organic pollutants from the water, while also killing bacteria in the water itself.At scale, the material could prove impactful in environmental cleanup from oil spills or other similar scenarios.The idea follows a phenomenon called the lotus effect, which refers to self-cleaning properties that are a result of ultrahydrophobicity exhibited by the lotus flower. This has long been a model for the fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces that have proven effective at cleaning, antifogging and antifouling. Past design strategies, however, have fallen short due to a lack of functionality and scalability.\"The versatility is the key here,\" said Mark Garren, a co-author on the paper and doctoral student in Handa's lab. \"The multifunctional properties are what inspired this, then developing that and showcasing all of its abilities.\"Going forward, the primary goal for researchers is to apply the surface to medical devices and demonstrate its effectiveness before moving on to non-human animal trials, and eventually, testing in humans. Facing less rigorous safety standards, the surface may be more readily deployable in the environmental cleanup use cases.

  "text": "For the rational design of new material compounds, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying their synthesis. Analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance and spectroscopy are usually employed to study such mechanisms in molecular reactions. However, reaction pathways governing the formation of solid-state crystalline compounds remain poorly understood.          This is partly due to the extreme temperatures and inhomogeneous reactions observed in solid-state compounds. Further, the presence of numerous atoms in solid crystalline compounds hinders precise analysis. Developing new techniques that can circumvent these challenges is, therefore, necessary.More recently, in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques have been used for investigating reactions occurring in crystalline phases. Owing to their high speed and temporal resolution, synchrotron XRD measurements provide access to reaction data within extremely short time windows (few hundred milliseconds). This makes the technique promising for capturing data pertaining to short-lived intermediate reaction phases.Now, a group of researchers from Japan have used such a state-of-the-art synchrotron XRD technique to report the topochemical solid-gas reduction mechanisms in layered perovskite. The study was led by Associate Professor Takafumi Yamamoto from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) and published in the journal Advanced Science.\"We used Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4,a Ruddlesden-Popper type layered perovskite, owing to its efficient oxygen storage ability. Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 undergoes reversible and fast topochemical redox reactions under O2 and H2 and shows excellent performance as an environmental catalyst material,\" explains Dr. Yamamoto.His collaborators had previously observed that doping Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 with Palladium (Pd) significantly increases the oxygen release rate while decreasing the release temperature. Based on these observations, the team investigated the reaction pathways and structural evolution of this perovskite during the solid-gas reduction.The team began by preparing a pristine sample and a Pd-loaded sample of Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4. They then used high-speed synchrotron XRD to monitor them as they underwent fast oxygen deintercalation (reduction).The analyses revealed that the reduction of pristine Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 proceeded via thermodynamically stable phases, with pristine Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 undergoing gradual single-phase structural evolution during its reduction.In contrast, the reduction of Pd-loaded Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 involved nonequilibrium intermediate phases, a drastically different pathway. It first transformed into a dynamically-disordered phase for a few seconds and then rearranged itself via a first-order transition to reach the final ordered and stable state.Additionally, Pd metal particles on the Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 surface significantly accelerated the oxygen deintercalation reaction of Pd-loaded Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 relative to that of pristine Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4.Dr. Yamamoto adds, \"The change in reaction dynamics following the loading of Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 with Pd demonstrates that surface treatment can be used to manipulate reaction processes in a crystalline material.\"In summary, these findings suggest that the synchrotron XRD technique can be leveraged to study reaction pathways in solid-state compounds as well as identify their rate-determining steps. This, in turn, could help optimize the reaction pathway for the rational design of high-performance functional materials.

  "text": "This study was carried out under the leadership of Dr. Ming-Liang Tong (Key Laboratory of Bioinorganic and Synthetic Chemistry of Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry, Sun Yat-Sen University) and Dr. Shiping Yang (College of Chemistry and Materials Science, Shanghai Normal University).          Hai-Ling Wang from Sun Yat-Sen University was responsible for the synthesis of highly stable spherical clusters (Ho32 and Gd32), analysis of high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS), analysis of solution behavior and assembly mechanism.Donglin Liu from Shanghai Normal University conducted in vivo and in vitro toxicity and magnetic resonance imaging tests and analyzes on Gd32. Due to the highly exposed metal centers, high-nuclear lanthanide clusters are usually easily attacked by solvent molecules in solution and lose their stability, which limits their application in solution.Based on the ligand-protected metal cluster core strategy, the research team designed and synthesized spherical high-nuclear lanthanide clusters with high stability and excellent solubility in organic solvents or aqueous solutions. These properties are particularly striking in the reported examples of lanthanide clusters. A large number of organic ligands in the periphery tightly wrap the cluster core to ensure the stability of the spherical cluster in solution.At present, the MRI contrast agents used clinically are mainly mononuclear gadolinium chelates, which show unsatisfactory imaging contrast due to their low Gd content. According to the SBM theory, increasing the content of Gd in the molecule can effectively increase the relaxation rate of CAs.The nanocluster Gd32 with highly aggregated Gd in the molecule has a T1 relaxation rate as high as 265.87 mM\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 at a magnetic field strength of 1 T, which is much higher than that of CA Gd-DTPA (4.55 mM\u22121\u00b7s\u22121, 1 T) currently used clinically. This surprising discovery prompted the research team to further explore the toxicity of Gd32 in vitro and in vivo, and these results indicated that Gd32 has great potential as a new type of CAs.Next, the research team made an in-depth comparison of the MRI imaging effects of Gd32 and Gd-DTPA in aqueous solution, in cells, and in mice with 4T1 tumor models. There is no doubt that Gd32 is superior to Gd-DTPA.These experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of ligand-protected metal cluster core strategy to construct highly stable lanthanide clusters, and provide a new way to construct low-dose novel Gd-based MRI contrast agents.The research is published in the journal National Science Review.

  "text": "Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, have created a compound that destroys a protein involved in driving cancers, including B-cell lymphoma.          The 'molecular glue'-type degrader could ultimately, with further research, be developed into a cancer drug, and will also be a powerful tool to study cancer biology.It's an example of an innovative approach to drug discovery known as protein degradation, that aims to target cancer by taking advantage of the cell's natural disposal system to remove proteins that can cause disease.In a new study, the research team describes how the degrader selectively sticks to the BCL6 protein\u2014a protein which B-cell lymphoma cells need to survive\u2014and tags it to be destroyed.BCL6 binds to the DNA and regulates genes that are involved in cell division and cell death. The protein is mutated in many cancers and finding a way to inhibit or reduce its levels could be a potential way to supress their growth.An innovative discoveryThe researchers sought to discover compounds that disrupt the function of the BCL6 protein and inhibit lymphoma cell growth. Their earlier work led to the identification of several compounds that had the potential to be developed further as BCL6 inhibitors.The team observed that some of the inhibitors they created also had the extra ability to degrade the BCL6 protein. These previously reported small-molecule degraders were able to fully deplete BCL6 in cells, but they had low solubility in water which made it difficult to dose sufficient amounts of the compound in animal models to keep the BCL6 levels down.In their new paper, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the team build on their previous findings to report the first BCL6 molecular glue-type degrader with suitable properties to test in animal models.By understanding what features of the molecule were needed to give the degrader effect, the team was able to create a potent compound that can bind to BCL6 more tightly and has improved water solubility, enabling sustained degradation of the protein in tumors in mice.The new compound had a modest effect on BCL6 levels in studies in mice\u2014with tumors growing significantly slower in the presence of the drug than in control tumors that received no drug.Although the preliminary results in mice were modest, they suggest that BCL6-targeted molecular glue-type degraders could help control tumor growth in lymphomas in combination with other therapies.The drug's ability to cause sustained depletion of BCL6 also makes it a very powerful tool to study BCL6 biology.      How do molecular glue-type degraders work?Protein turnover is a basic process that occurs in cells. It is controlled by the ubiquitin proteasome system, where specialized enzymes, including a family of proteins called the E3 ubiquitin ligases, recognize defective proteins and tag them with a small regulatory protein called ubiquitin.Once tagged with ubiquitin, another part of the system detects it and takes the tagged protein to the proteasome\u2014a protein complex that breaks down unnecessary or damaged proteins.Molecular glue-type degraders are small compounds that facilitate interactions between a target protein and the ubiquitin proteasome system. They act in a different way to more traditional 'small molecule' drugs, which bind to a specific site on a protein and block its function.While many small molecule drugs have been hugely successful cancer treatments, the protein degradation approach offers the hope of new therapies that hit currently 'undruggable' targets and potentially have long-lasting effects by completely removing proteins from cells.Complex chemistryStudy co-leader Dr. Benjamin Bellenie, senior staff scientist in the ICR's Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery, said, \"One interesting feature of our BCL6 project was that the initial compound we discovered from our screen had low solubility, which is not an ideal feature for drugs.\"\"With further investigations, we realized that the component contributing to low solubility was also giving the compound its 'glue-like' characteristic. This made it very challenging to optimize the molecule as any changes to improve its solubility often resulted in loss of its ability to stick to the target effectively.\"\"So we're thrilled to announce our discovery of a set of new molecular glue-type degraders for BCL6, which drives cancers including lymphoma. Our project was a delicate balance of optimizing solubility of our candidate compounds without losing potency, and ultimately, we were able to create a compound that can bind BCL6 very tightly and form a 'glued complex' even at low concentrations.\"Study co-leader Professor Swen Hoelder, head of chemistry at the ICR, said, \"We're very excited by the potential of protein degradation to deliver new drugs that could make a big difference in cancer treatment, and that's why we founded our Centre for Protein Degradation here at the ICR. I'm pleased to announce the discovery of our new molecular glue-type degrader of BCL6 in this new study, which is also a great example of creative science in a cutting-edge, innovative field in cancer drug discovery.\" More information:Rosemary Huckvale et al, Improved Binding Affinity and Pharmacokinetics Enable Sustained Degradation of BCL6 In Vivo, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (2022).

  "question_squad": " What is the main cause of plastic degradation?",
  "answer_squad": " atmospheric oxygen",
  "text": "Plastic materials are prone to degradation by atmospheric oxygen. These auto-oxidation reactions occur at ambient temperature but become especially relevant during melt processing. Adding antioxidants to the polymers results in a pronounced slowing-down of the oxidation processes. Only in this way, the production of plastic parts by injection molding, for example, is possible.          Developing new plastic grades is accompanied by lengthy experimental procedures to optimize the antioxidant content. For Fraunhofer Institute for Structural Durability and System Reliability, these online rheological investigations are a promising method for accelerating the development process.AntioxidantsOrganic matter, and therefore also plastics, degrade by auto-oxidation when in contact with air. This degradation is initiated by elevated temperature or light and propagates as a radical chain reaction that causes cleavage of the polymer chains. The latter are primarily attacked by the OH radical resulting in the formation of hydroperoxide moieties. These triggers follow-up reactions leading to regeneration of the OH-radical.For optimum protection of the polymer, two different types of antioxidants must be added. The primary antioxidant, often containing a phenolic structure, quenches the OH-radical. Secondary antioxidants consist of sterically hindered alkyl-derivatives of functional groups, such as phosphites or thioethers. These react with the hydroperoxide without OH formation. Both types of antioxidant therefore act in a synergistic way. A typical commercially available stabilizer package containing both antioxidants in equal amounts was used in the described experiments.Studying process stabilizationCommercially available virgin plastic grades are typically equipped with appropriate stabilizer packages ready for use. For the sake of resource efficiency and economy, the optimum content of the process stabilizer must be determined during the development of new plastic grades. Processing of used plastics to recyclates faces the same problem because the stabilizers have been regularly depleted during the previous life cycle.Compounding the mill charge to recyclates to be used for example in injection molding, requires adding stabilizers adjusted to the respective type of plastics and its stage of aging. The traditional way to optimize the stabilizer content is based on compounding a series containing varying amounts of antioxidants. The compounds are then characterized offline by means of different tests, such as the melt volume rate (MVR, DIN 1133-1) or the oxidative induction time (OIT, ASTM D3895-19). First reliable results are obtained only after the compounding step.Online characterization offers new potentialResearchers at Fraunhofer LBF are working to obtain an indication regarding the efficacy of the actual stabilizer content during the compounding step. To this end, the viscosity of the melt is used as a recorded response while varying the recipe. This is realized by incorporating an online rheometer behind the screw tips of a twin screw extruder to measure the flow curves of the shear as well as the elongational viscosity.The first experiments were carried out on a minimally stabilized virgin polypropylene (PP).The amount of stabilizer added was varied at selected screw speeds. The reduced process-related degradation is immediately reflected in an increase in viscosity in the flow curves. Above a certain additive level there is no further increase in viscosity. This means that for the actual processing conditions, the stabilizer concentration has reached the limit above which no further improvement can be achieved.Thus, online rheology provides the formulation developer with valuable information regarding the efficacy of a processing stabilizer during compounding.Furthermore, the flow curves of the different polymers are not identical. The information content of a flow curve is therefore much higher than that of a single numerical value from an MVR measurement. In addition, the flow curves of the elongational viscosity can be included in the evaluation. Supported by an appropriate AI-based system, online rheology appears to be a very promising tool in implementing stabilization during the production of recyclates with the ability of real-time adjustment to the aging stage of the mill charges.

  "text": "Development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has been rapid, but the rise of variants forces scientists to frequently modify treatments. Ideally, therapies would target mutation-resistant viral proteins, but this has proven difficult. Researchers reporting in ACS Central Science, however, have now developed a system that directly targets and degrades the viral RNA genome, reducing infection in mice. The method could be adapted to fight off many viruses, as well as treat various diseases.          Vaccines and antiviral drugs typically target proteins critical to viral infection and replication. This targeting induces evolutionary pressure for the virus to mutate, however, reducing the effectiveness of existing treatments and requiring development of new vaccines and drugs.To get around this issue, researchers have turned to targeting highly conserved structures within the viral RNA genome. Other groups have linked small molecule RNA binders to ribonuclease L ligands (RIBOTACs), creating degraders that relied on ribonuclease expression within cells, which varied across tissues.Avoiding this dependency, Gon\u00e7alo J. L. Bernardes, Konstantinos Tzelepis, Sigitas Mikutis and colleagues showed that attaching imidazole to RNA could degrade the nucleic acid, so they wondered whether attaching imidazole to an RNA-binding molecule would result in targeted degradation.To accomplish this, the team used pyridostatin (PDS), which binds to G-quadruplex (G4) RNA structures, and MTDB, which binds to betacoronaviral pseudoknots, as the RNA-binding molecules. The researchers then appended each compound with a flexible linker and imidazole and called these molecules proximity-induced nucleic acid degraders (PINADs). By bringing imidazole into close proximity to the RNA, both PINADs degraded SARS-CoV-2 RNA.In addition, the compounds were effective when tested in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and its alpha and delta variants. Importantly, when the researchers gave the MTDB degrader to mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, viral load was reduced, as were levels of a biomarker of viral infection and replication.The researchers say that their system should allow any RNA-binding small molecule to be converted to a PINAD, so that it could someday be used to target and destroy other disease-related RNAs. This list could include disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or Huntington's disease, targeting the mRNAs of misfolded proteins that have otherwise proven difficult to target.

  "answer_squad": " Period",
  "text": "New research from a multidisciplinary team helps to illuminate the mechanisms behind circadian rhythms, offering new hope for dealing with jet lag, insomnia and other sleep disorders.          Using innovative cryo-electron microscopy techniques, the researchers have identified the structure of the circadian rhythm photosensor and its target in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), one of the major organisms used to study circadian rhythms. The research, \"Cryptochrome-Timeless Structure Reveals Circadian Clock Timing Mechanisms\" published April 26 in Nature.The research focused on fruit fly cryptochromes, key components of the circadian clocks of plants and animals, including humans. In flies and other insects, cryptochromes, activated by blue light, serve as the primary light sensors for setting circadian rhythms. The target of the cryptochrome photosensor, known as \"Timeless\" (TIM), is a large, complex protein that could not previously be imaged and thus its interactions with the cryptochrome are not well understood.Circadian rhythms work via what are basically genetic feedback loops. The researchers found that the TIM protein, along with its partner, the Period (PER) protein, act together to inhibit the genes that are responsible for their own production. With suitable delays between the events of gene expression and repression, an oscillation in protein levels is established.This oscillation represents the \"the ticking of the clock and seems to be fairly unique to the circadian rhythm,\" said senior author Brian Crane, the George W. and Grace L. Todd Professor and chair of chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences.Blue light, Crane said, changes the chemistry and structure of cryptochrome's flavin cofactor, which allows the protein to bind the TIM protein and inhibit TIM's ability to repress gene expression and thereby reset the oscillation.Much of the hard work of the study went into figuring out how to produce the complex of cryptochrome-TIM so it could be studied, because TIM is such a large, unwieldy protein, Crane said. To achieve their results, first author Changfan Lin, M.S. '17, Ph.D. '21, modified the cryptochrome protein to improve the stability of the cryptochrome-TIM complex and used innovative techniques to purify the samples, making them suitable for high-resolution imaging.      \"These new methods allowed us to obtain detailed images of the protein structures and gain valuable insights into their function,\" said Lin, a Friedrich's Ataxia Research Alliance Postdoctoral Fellow at the California Institute of Technology. \"This research not only deepens our understanding of circadian rhythm regulation but also opens up new possibilities for developing therapies targeting related processes.\"Co-author Shi Feng, a doctoral student in the field of biophysics, did much of the cryo-electron microscopy work. Cristina C. DeOliveira, a doctoral student in the field of biochemistry and molecular and cell biology, was also a co-author.One unexpected result from the study sheds light on how DNA damage is repaired in a cell. Cryptochromes are closely related to a family of enzymes involved in repairing damage to DNA, called photolyases. Crane said the research \"explains why these families of proteins are closely related to each other, even though they're doing quite different things\u2014they're making use of the same molecular recognition in different contexts.\"The study also offers an explanation for the genetic variation of flies that allows them to adapt to higher latitudes, where days are shorter in the winter and it's cooler. These flies have more of a certain genetic variant that involves a change in the TIM protein, and it wasn't clear why the variation could help them. The researchers found that because of how the cryptochrome binds TIM, the variation reduces the affinity of TIM for the cryptochrome. The interaction between the proteins is then modulated and the ability of light to reset the oscillation is changed, thus altering the circadian clock and extending the period of the fly's dormancy, which helps it survive the winter.\"Some of the interactions that we see here in the fruit fly can be mapped onto human proteins,\" Crane said. \"This study may help us understand key interactions between components that regulate sleep behavior in people, such as how the critical delays in the basic timing mechanism get built into the system.\"Another exciting finding, said Lin, was the discovery of an important structural area in TIM, called the \"groove,\" which helps explain how TIM enters the cell nucleus. Previous studies had identified some factors involved in this process, but the exact mechanism remained unclear. \"Our research provided a clearer understanding of this phenomenon,\" Lin said.

  "text": "Researchers at the College of Environmental Science and Engineering of Nankai University have introduced a new strategy to realize rapid biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) measurement by using the competitive switching of electrotrophic and heterotrophic pathways of facultative bacteria. The findings were published in Water Research under the title \"Switchover of Electrotrophic and Heterotrophic Respirations Enables the Biomonitoring of Low Concentration of BOD in Oxygen-rich Environment.\"          The research team isolated and obtained a strain of Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 with both electrotrophic and heterotrophic respiration from microbial electroactive biofilms (EABs) over a period of five years. The findings of research reveal that this bacterium can respire with a polarized graphite electrode in the absence of a degradable organic carbon source, and the current generated at this point can be used as the baseline of sensors.When degradable pollutants are present in the water, RAG-1 swiftly switches to heterotrophic respiration, resulting in a decrease in current. The decrease in current value is proportional to the concentration of organic pollutants. Based on this, the research team developed a novel bio-cathode BOD sensor, which has a linear response to common pollutants such as organic acids, sugars, proteins, humic acids, as well as mixtures such as low-concentration domestic sewage and lake sediments. It realizes sensitive monitoring of oxygen-rich and low-BOD water, with a test time of less than three hours.This study further explains the switchover mechanism of facultative electrotrophic bacteria's metabolic pathways and their adaptability and resilience to contaminated environment. Based on this new principle, the research team will develop more electrotrophic-heterotrophic microorganisms as sensing elements to support rapid BOD monitoring under complex environmental scenarios. This technique is expected to be used in water quality regulation for aquaculture, water quality monitoring for reclaimed water, and more.

  "answer_squad": " upcycling",
  "text": "Plastics are everywhere in our daily lives, but not all plastics are created equal\u2014far from it.          Take, for instance, polyethylene terephthalate, a plastic used to make soda bottles and clothing fibers. Then there's high-density polyethylene, from which shampoo bottles, milk jugs and cutting boards are derived. Don't forget polystyrene for packaging, or low-density polyethylene, which gives us cling wrap and grocery bags.All of these are plastics, which are the most widely used types of polymers\u2014macromolecules made of repeating units of small molecules called monomers. Post-consumer plastics are almost always collected as a mixed stream of waste, and products are often manufactured from two or more types of plastics.The bad news is that these items, though all \"plastics,\" are chemically and physically incompatible, and there's no good industrial method for reusing or re-processing them into other useful products. That's why most of those \"recyclables\" you're throwing into bins every week are going to a landfill. Even after careful sorting and separation into individual plastics, mechanical recycling usually yields inferior products, termed down-cycling.Polymer chemists at Colorado State University have long been leaders in finding ways to tackle the environmental problems humans have created with plastics waste. Now, they've come up with fundamental new chemistry that seeds a creative solution to the challenge of recycling mixed-use plastics.Led by University Distinguished Professor Eugene Chen in the Department of Chemistry, and Tomislav Rovis and Sanat Kumar, professors at Columbia University (Rovis was formerly a faculty member at CSU), the team has devised a new chemical strategy that delivers specifically designed small molecules called universal dynamic crosslinkers into mixed plastic streams.These crosslinkers transform a former muck of unmixable materials into a viable new set of polymers, which can be turned into new, higher-value, re-processable materials, a process known as upcycling. The work is published in the journal Nature.Dynamic crosslinkersWhen heated and processed together with the dynamic crosslinkers added in small amounts, the mixed plastics are made compatible with each other through in-situ formation of a new material, called a multiblock copolymer.Kumar likened the block copolymers to soap molecules, which make water compatible with oily dirt molecules. \"In a similar way, these new types of dynamically formed 'soaps,' i.e. the block copolymers, compatibilize mixed plastics and make them usable as a new kind of material with useful properties.\"This new method of upcycling, which does not involve deconstructing or reconstructing any of the original polymers, introduces a potential solution for recapturing materials and energy endowed in post-consumer mixed plastics that typically end up in landfills.The team designed their crosslinkers and tested them on a variety of plastics, including samples of mixed polyethylene Ziploc bags and polylactide cups without prior purification or removal of additives or dyes, which are typically present in post-consumer plastic products. They combined their experiments with modeling studies to verify that the crosslinkers induce the formation of new multiblock copolymers.\"The system is so efficient, it compatibilizes three different polymers into a single new material,\" Rovis said.Multiple use cyclesThe researchers posit that their new strategy could help achieve the ultimate goal of reusing mixed plastic waste over multiple use cycles, Chen said.\"A key barrier is cost; we are talking about millions of tons of plastic waste, and you have to consider how many of these dynamic crosslinkers you need, although we currently need only less than 5% of the weight of the plastics in our upcycling process. Like many fundamental discoveries made in history, practical obstacles exist at the very beginning, but we are very excited about future potential.\" More information:Clarke, R.W. et al, Dynamic crosslinking compatibilizes immiscible mixed plastics, Nature (2023).

  "answer_squad": " New chemical process",
  "text": "Researchers have developed a new chemical process that is not limited to wind turbine blades but works on many different so-called fiber-reinforced epoxy composites, including some materials that are reinforced with especially costly carbon fibers.          This process could contribute to establishing a potential circular economy in the wind turbine, aerospace, automotive and space industries, where these reinforced composites, due to their light weight and long durability, are used for load-bearing structures.Being designed to last, the durability of wind turbine blades poses an environmental challenge. Wind turbine blades mostly end up at waste landfills when they are decommissioned, because they are extremely difficult to break down.If no solution is found, we will have accumulated 43 million tons of wind turbine blade waste globally by 2050.The newly discovered process is a proof-of-concept of a recycling strategy that can be applied to the vast majority of both existing wind turbine blades and those presently in production, as well as other epoxy-based materials.The results have just been published in Nature, and Aarhus University, together with the Danish Technological Institute, have filed a patent application for the process.Specifically, the researchers have shown that by using a ruthenium-based catalyst and the solvents isopropanol and toluene, they can separate the epoxy matrix and release one of the epoxy polymer's original building blocks, bisphenol A (BPA), and fully intact glass fibers in a single process.However, the method is not immediately scalable yet, as the catalytic system is not efficient enough for industrial implementation\u2014and ruthenium is a rare and expensive metal. Therefore, the scientists from Aarhus University are continuing their work on improving this methodology.\"Nevertheless, we see it as a significant breakthrough for the development of durable technologies that can create a circular economy for epoxy-based materials.

  "text": "Safer and more effective blood thinners could be on the way following a groundbreaking discovery by researchers at UBC and the University of Michigan, published today in Nature Communications.          By combining their expertise in blood clotting systems and chemical synthesis, the researchers have designed a new compound called MPI 8 that offers the potential to prevent blood clots without any increased risk of bleeding\u2014a common side effect of existing blood thinners.\"The development of MPI 8 represents a major breakthrough in the field of blood clot prevention and treatment,\" said Dr. Jay Kizhakkedathu, a professor and Canada Research Chair at UBC's department of pathology and laboratory medicine and the UBC Centre for Blood Research. \"By targeting a specific molecule involved in clot formation without disrupting the natural clotting process, we've created a blood thinner that has proven safer and more effective in animal models, with enormous potential to improve human lives as well.\"Further research will be needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of MPI 8 in humans, but initial results offer hope for a new era in blood clot prevention and thrombosis treatment while serving as a testament to the power of collaboration in research medicine.Blood clots are a serious health concern affecting millions of people around the world. When left untreated, they can lead to life-threatening conditions such as deep vein thrombosis, heart attack, pulmonary embolism and stroke.Blood thinners, also known as anticoagulants or antithrombotic drugs, are essential in the treatment and prevention of blood clots but carry a significant risk of bleeding. This can cause complications and limit their use in some patients.Existing blood thinners such as heparin, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and warfarin work by targeting enzymes that are essential for blood clotting. However, they must be carefully dosed and monitored because disabling those enzymes threatens the normal clotting process required to heal wounds.UBC and Michigan researchers took an innovative approach to instead target polyphosphate, a molecule involved in blood clotting that accelerates the process but is not essential for it.\"Our thought was that polyphosphate might be a safer target to go after with an antithrombotic drug, because it would just slow these clotting reactions down\u2014even if we take out 100 percent of the action of the polyphosphate,\" said Dr. Jim Morrissey, a professor of biological chemistry and internal medicine at the University of Michigan whose work has illuminated the role of polyphosphate in blood clotting.\"We really had to come up with an extremely novel way to target it compared to the usual drugs that target clotting, and that's where the expertise of Dr. Kizhakkedathu's lab became so important.\"After building a library of potential molecules and screening them for their desired criteria, the Kizhakkedathu lab zeroed in on MPI 8. This unique molecule has \"smart\" binding groups with positive charges that are drawn to polyphosphate's negative charge. It will bind to polyphosphate and inhibit it while leaving the body's other negatively charged cells and proteins alone, eliminating toxic side effects.In preclinical studies, MPI 8 demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in preventing blood clots in mice without increasing bleeding risk. The drug showed no signs of toxicity, even at high doses.\"Not only does the drug show promise as a safer and more effective option for patients, but the design platform we used to create MPI 8 is flexible, potentially allowing for the development of additional compounds with similar properties and efficacy,\" said Dr. Chanel La, who worked on the project as a chemistry Ph.D. student in the Kizhakkedathu lab.\"Assuming our work continues to produce positive results, I would be very excited to get MPI 8 into an approved clinical trial and bring this drug closer to becoming a reality for patients in need.\" More information:Smart thrombosis inhibitors without bleeding side effects via charge tunable ligand design, Nature Communications (2023).

They also include new solid electrolytes that would eliminate the current liquid electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries, making them less likely to catch fire.Using Polybot, the CNM team is focusing on polymer electronics for energy-saving and medical purposes. These include devices that are recyclable or decompose after use.      Scientists usually prepare polymers for electronics by synthesizing polymer molecules with desired chemical structures, creating a solution with a mixture of many components. They then convert the solution into a thin layer of solid material. Layers of different compositions printed together serve as the basis for making different types of devices.To achieve targeted performance, the number of potential tweaks is overwhelming. They run from spiking the fabrication recipe with different formulations to varying the processing conditions. By conventional experimental means, such development can take years of intense labor. Polybot can greatly reduce the development time and cost.A typical experiment with Polybot begins by using AI and robots for different tasks. The automated system chooses a promising recipe for a polymer solution, prepares it and prints it as a very thin film at a selected speed and temperature. The system then hardens this film for an optimal length of time and measures key features, such as thickness and uniformity, as a quality check. Next, it assembles multiple layers together and adds electrodes to form a device.After that, Polybot measures the device's electrical performance. All the relevant data are automatically recorded and analyzed with machine learning and passed to the AI component. The AI then direct what experiments to do next. Polybot can also respond to feedback provided by users and data from the scientific literature.\"This is all done with minimal human intervention,\" Xu said.\"We have plans in place to expand the capabilities of our self-driving lab to take advantage of other Argonne scientific facilities,\" said Chan.Already, the properties of electronic devices fabricated in Polybot have been analyzed with a powerful X-ray beam. This was done by using an instrument with a robotic sample handler at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), a DOE Office of Science user facility at Argonne. That connection could be strengthened to take full advantage of the APS after its upgrade is complete in 2024.\"X-ray scattering analysis expands the Polybot's characterization down to the molecular level, revealing information about the orientation and packing of the molecules that can help speed up the search for the best materials with optimal performance,\" said Joseph Strzalka, a physicist in Argonne's X-ray Science division. \"We are working on bringing the Polybot's capabilities to an APS beamline so we can generate the large numbers of materials the APS upgrade will be capable of studying.\"\"We are excited at the prospect of leveraging the supercomputing capabilities at Argonne to enhance Polybot,\" Chan explained. \"The goal is to conduct physics-based simulations prior to, during and after an actual experiment to gain deeper insights into a material or device and provide better feedback to the AI.\" The team plans to utilize the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, a DOE Office of Science user facility, to perform the simulations. This will streamline the discovery process even further.With these capabilities and more, self-driving labs like Polybot have the potential to accelerate the discovery process from years to months. They also could reduce the cost of complex projects from millions to thousands of dollars.

  "text": "In the RUBIO project, 18 partners are turning the vision of a sustainable plastics industry into reality. Their goal is to use regionally available plant residues to create versatile, sustainable products that are recyclable and biodegradable. As part of the project, the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research IAP is developing new types of the bioplastic polybutylene succinate (PBS) so that it can be used for significantly more applications. Together with the company POLIFILM EXTRUSION GmbH, the Fraunhofer IAP has developed an initial commercial product.          Bioplastics are increasingly providing an alternative to petroleum-based plastics. These sustainable materials offer a number of advantages: They are made from renewable resources and help to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and CO2 emissions into the environment. They can be biodegradable and have processing properties comparable to those of classic petroleum-based plastics. Like classic plastics, bioplastics can be sorted, fractionated and recycled.Why aren't petroleum-based plastics simply replaced by bioplastics?Despite the high potential, there are a number of factors that prevent companies from manufacturing their products from bioplastics: Worldwide, there are only a few manufacturers offering bioplastics on the market. For plastics processors, this causes problems with ensuring supply, higher costs, and a too limited choice of different types of bioplastics to realize the wide range of possible applications.In addition, there is a need for technical improvement and it is often not clear for which specific applications bioplastics are suitable. Finally, bioplastics are currently often produced from sugarcane and corn\u2014potential food or feed sources, which could raise a kind of \"food or plastic\" discussion.New PBS types enable more diverse areas of applicationTherefore, the need for developments in this field is great. Experts from the Fraunhofer IAP are tackling these hurdles together with partners from science and industry in the project \"Regional Entrepreneurial Alliance for the Development of Value Added Chains for Technical Bioplastics in Central Germany,\" RUBIO.Thomas B\u00fcsse, who coordinates the joint project \"Processing\" at RUBIO and heads the Processing Pilot Plant for Biopolymers (located in Schwarzheide in Brandenburg, Germany) of Fraunhofer IAP, explains: \"Depending on the application or processing technology, the plastic used must be hard or soft, perhaps also high or low viscosity can be required. However, there are only three types of PBS on the market, and these are suitable only for a limited number of processing methods and applications.\"For this reason, the team in Dr. Antje Lieske's department \"Polymer Synthesis\" of Fraunhofer IAP in Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany, is developing entirely new types of PBS that can be processed using a much wider range of methods\u2014for instance from blow molding to injection molding. Thus, the researchers are also increasing the portfolio of possible applications.The know-how of the polymer specialists at the Fraunhofer IAP goes far beyond the mere development of synthesis processes for new types of bioplastics. In the synthesis pilot plant of the Fraunhofer Pilot Plant Center for Polymer Synthesis and Processing PAZ in Schkopau, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany the team led by Dr. Ulrich Wendler, head of the \"Synthesis and Product Development\" department at the Fraunhofer IAP, is transferring the results from the laboratory and pilot plant to an industrial pilot scale. The question of how the newly developed plastic types and blends can be thermoplastically processed is being intensively investigated in the processing pilot plant.Tests on biodegradability, printability, sealability or machinability are also carried out here\u2014criteria that the researchers can set individually at the customer's request. Recyclability is also tested in the RUBIO consortium. \"The important thing is that bioplastics can and must be recycled. Degradability only comes into play when large or small plastic particles are lost during use and thus end up in the environment,\" B\u00fcsse emphasizes.Within the framework of the RUBIO project Fraunhofer IAP and POLIFILM EXTRUSION GmbH have achieved a first success. The German company produces plastic films for various applications in the packaging, construction, agricultural, automotive and other sectors on more than 80 extrusion lines at its Wei\u00dfandt-G\u00f6lzau site in Saxony-Anhalt. The partners have developed a PBS film that can be used for shipping bags.\"This cooperation is an important step towards sustainability and allows us to offer products made from regional waste materials that are recyclable and additionally biodegradable if lost to the environment. Another advantage is the processing on common extrusion lines, so that nothing stands in the way of the triumphal march of PBS materials,\" explains Tobias Otto, Project Manager R&D at POLIFILM EXTRUSION GmbH.      No 'food-or-plastic' discussion due to regional plant residuesThe development of the new PBS film goes even further, because so far the bioplastic is not yet based on regional raw materials. But that will change in the further course of the cooperation. Plant residues from the region will be the raw material in the future.\"In principle, all materials that contain cellulose or lignocellulose can be used. This includes unrotted fermentation residues from biogas plants, residues from farms that occur in a variety of forms, or theoretically even waste from paper production,\" explains Thomas B\u00fcsse. Ideally, the use of regional residual materials has another advantage in the long term: Shorter transport routes can lead to lower prices and greater sustainability of the plastic products produced.

  "text": "Doctors often use tongue depressors when peering in a patient's mouth and throat. But what if that flat wooden spatula could actively evaluate the patient's health? That's the premise of an ecofriendly disposable sensor, reported in  Analytical Chemistry, that can check levels of glucose and other biomarkers in saliva. Researchers say the easy-to-produce device could someday help doctors assess a range of conditions.          Wood is a renewable, biodegradable, natural material that is widely available at low cost, which makes it attractive for researchers who design electronics and sensors. However, this is challenging because the material isn't good at conducting electricity. One solution is to use wood as a passive substrate and then coat it with metals and carbon-based inks. Alternatively, high-power lasers can char specific regions on the wood, turning those spots into conductive graphite.But this complicated technique requires sophisticated and expensive instrumentation, an oxygen-free atmosphere and fire retardants. To develop a cheaper and easier process, Christos Kokkinos and colleagues turned to low-power diode lasers, which have already been successfully used to make polyimide-based sensors but haven't previously been applied to wooden electronics and electrochemical sensors.The team used a portable, low-cost laser engraver to create a pattern of conductive graphite electrodes on a wooden tongue depressor, without the need for special conditions. Those electrodes formed two electrochemical cells separated by lines drawn with a water-repellent permanent marker.The biosensor was then used to rapidly and simultaneously measure concentrations of nitrite and glucose in artificial saliva. Nitrite can reveal oral diseases, such as periodontitis, while glucose can serve as a diagnostic for diabetes. The researchers say these low-cost devices could be adapted to detect other saliva biomarkers and would be quick and easy to produce on-site at medical facilities.

  "text": "The combustion of oil, coal or natural gas produces carbon dioxide, or CO2. This notorious greenhouse gas is a major driver of global warming, but it is also a raw material. It is technically possible to convert CO2 into useful carbon compounds, a process which requires energy, water, suitable electrodes and special catalysts.          CO2 can be electrochemically converted to carbon monoxide, formate or methane, but also to ethylene, propanol, acetate and ethanol. However, industrial processes must be designed to be highly selective and extremely efficient to produce only the desired products and not a mixture of products.\"By electrolytically reducing CO2 to useful hydrocarbons, we can produce new fuels without using fossil resources. We thus are putting the CO2 back into the cycle, just like recycling,\" explains Dr. Matthew Mayer, leader of the Helmholtz Young Investigator Group \"Electrochemical Conversion\" at HZB. The electrical energy for the electrolysis can be provided by renewable energy from wind or solar, making the process sustainable.The zero-gap cell: a sandwich of many layersFrom school, we know electrolysis can be done in a simple beaker of water; a further development of this is the H-cell, which is shaped like the letter H. However, such cells are not suitable for industrial use. Instead, industrial electrolyzers are designed with a sandwich architecture consisting of several layers: On the right and left are the electrodes that conduct the current and are coated with catalysts, a copper-based gas diffusion layer that lets in the CO2 gas, and a separation membrane.The electrolyte (here supplied at the anode and called anolyte) consists of dissolved potassium compounds and allows ions to move between the electrodes. The membrane is designed to allow negatively charged ions to pass through and to block positively charged potassium ions.The problem: Potassium crystals Nevertheless, potassium ions from the electrolyte pass through the membrane and form tiny crystals at the cathode, clogging the pores. \"This shouldn't happen,\" says Flora Haun, a Ph.D. student in Matthew Mayer's team.Using scanning electron microscopy and other imaging techniques, the scientists were able to study the process of crystal formation at the cathode in detail. \"With energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, we were able to locate the individual elements and show exactly where potassium crystals were forming,\" Flora Haun explains.The more potassium the electrolyte contains, the more the cathode becomes clogged, the investigations showed. But there is no simple way to solve the problem: reducing the potassium concentration is good on the one hand, but bad on the other, since the reaction equilibrium also shifts: instead of the desired ethylene, carbon monoxide is produced.The electrolyte is the key\"The most important observation is that cations can still penetrate the anion exchange membrane, but to an extent that depends on the concentration of the electrolyte. And that with the concentration of the electrolyte we simultaneously regulate which products are formed from the CO2,\" says Dr. Gumaa El Nagar, a postdoctoral researcher in the team.\"In the next step, we want to use operando and in situ measurements using X-rays to find out in detail how ion migration in the cell affects the chemical reaction processes,\" says Matthew Mayer.The study is published in the journal Nature Communications.

  "text": "Researchers from the Institute of Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering at TU Graz and the Austrian Center of Industrial Biotechnology (ACIB) have developed a novel method for the production of central components of mRNA vaccines and applied for a patent.          In an article published in the journal Nature Communications, Bernd Nidetzky, Martin Pfeiffer and Andrej Ribar explain how they produced the essential vaccine ingredient pseudouridine by means of biocatalytic synthesis and thus created an alternative to the previous method of chemical synthesis.One process step is sufficientThis alternative offers some decisive advantages. The chemical synthesis of pseudouridine not only involves toxic reagents and rare raw materials, but is also very energy- and time-consuming due to the necessary four to eight process steps and cooling to minus 20 degrees.Biocatalysis, on the other hand, requires only one process step with four parallel reactions that take place at room temperature. In addition, only four enzymes are needed as catalysts (uridine phosphorylase, phosphopentose mutase, pseudouridine monophosphate glycosidase and phosphatase), and these can be produced quite easily with E.coli bacteria. Biocatalysis also produces no waste materials; the only waste is phosphate, but this is recycled again during the catalysis process.Another important advantage is efficiency. Since, in short, the chemical production of pseudouridine converts the naturally occurring uridine, which is less efficient for vaccines, there is no 100% yield during the conversion process. However, due to the smaller number of process steps, biocatalytic synthesis achieves a yield of 92 to 95%, compared to just 40% to 50% for the chemical processes published so far.Inspiration from natureThe researchers based the development of this new process on one of their earlier studies in which they discovered that the YeiN enzyme is a biocatalyst for the production of C-nucleotides. Since pseudouridine is the C-nucleoside of the RNA building block uridine, they had the idea of taking uridine, which can be produced in large quantities by means of bacterial fermentations, as a raw material and re-establishing the bond between its basic building blocks. The inspiration for this came from nature.Unlike pseudouridine, uridine has an N-glycosidic bond, which is cleaved into ribose-1-phosphate (sugar) and uracil during natural degradation in cells by means of the enzyme uridine phosphorylase. Then the enzyme phosphopentose mutase comes into play, which rearranges the ribose-1-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate, which is metabolized in the cells.This is followed by the application of the YeiN enzyme, which is used to link the ribose-5-phosphate and the uracil to pseudouridine-5-phosphate. Phosphatase is used to split off the phosphate from the pseudouridine and the goal is reached. Since pseudouridine is much less water-soluble than uridine, it simply crystallizes in the course of the reaction and can therefore be easily obtained by filtering the reaction supernatant.Production on a larger scale\"Our work shows that biocatalysis is a potent alternative to the chemical synthesis of C-nucleotides such as pseudouridine,\" explains Bernd Nidetzky, head of the Institute of Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering at TU Graz.\"We hope to implement the production on a larger scale soon and thus make pseudouridine available sustainably and cheaply in larger quantities. This could possibly also make the production of mRNA vaccines cheaper in the medium term, as potential partners from industry could implement our application quite promptly.\" More information:Martin Pfeiffer et al, A selective and atom-economic rearrangement of uridine by cascade biocatalysis for production of pseudouridine, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "Raman imaging offers a greater potential for detecting multiple enzyme activities than fluorescence imaging, demonstrate Tokyo Tech researchers by developing 9CN-rhodol-based activatable Raman probes using a novel mechanism for Raman signal activation. The strategy allows a synthesis of highly activatable Raman probes with high aggregation and multiplexing ability, making it a promising tool for extending the range of Raman probes for the detection of multiple enzyme activities in heterogeneous biological tissues.          The involvement of enzymes in a wide range of biological activities makes them ideal biomarkers for the detection of diseases. In fact, cancer-specific diagnostic technologies use fluorescence imaging for detecting upregulated cancer-associated enzymes in the affected cells. Moreover, since tumor tissues are heterogenous, detecting multiple enzyme activities simultaneously could allow precise cancer visualization and diagnosis. However, the inability to detect multiple enzyme activities can potentially limit the application of fluorescence imaging in heterogeneous tumor tissues and other complex biological phenomena.As an alternative, the narrower spectral width of Raman spectral imaging offers hope for multiplexing biological imaging with molecular probes. Over the years, several functional and activatable Raman probes (dyes) for detecting bioanalytes have been developed, but those for detecting enzyme activities have been limited. Further, the previous design strategies have failed to control the diffusion of enzyme-generated hydrolysis product of these probes, making it difficult to distinguish regions with target enzyme activity in tissues.Against this backdrop, a team of researchers from Japan led by Professor Mako Kamiya and Assistant Professor Hiroyoshi Fujioka of Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) recently reported, taking inspiration from aggregation-based fluorescent probes, a new molecular design strategy for the synthesis of activatable Raman probes based on 9CN-rhodol. Their study was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.Explaining the choice of rhodol derivatives for molecular scaffold, Prof. Kamiya says, \"Hiroyoshi found that rhodol derivatives with a nitrile group at the ninth position (9CN-rhodols) and a net charge of zero exhibit a single sharp Raman peak and have higher aggregation ability in aqueous solution than 9CN-pyronins with positive charge. Accordingly, we used 9CN-rhodol scaffold dyes to create Raman probes that can exhibit high sensitivity and undergo red shift in molecular absorption towards a region of resonant Raman effect and form aggregation upon interacting with the target enzymes.\"Accordingly, the team first synthesized 9CN-rhodol derivatives and selected two derivatives, 9CN-JR and 9CN-JCR, as candidates for designing the activatable Raman probes. They then tested the enzyme detection performance of both probes in live cells using a dual-color stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging technique. Of the two, 9CN-JCR emerged as the better and brighter probe for multiplexing.Next, the team isotope-labeled the nitril group of 9CN-JCR scaffold with Carbon-13 (13C) and Nitrogen-15 (15N) and then created two new isotope edited 9CN-JCR probes for \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzymes. The new set of 9CN-JCR-based probes was then able to simultaneously detect the activities of all these enzymes in the live cell culture.Moreover, the probes allowed ex vivo imaging of distinct cell regions expressing target enzyme activity in Drosophila wing disk and fat body. The high spatial selectivity and sensitivity exhibited by the 9CN-JCR probes was attributed to the electronic pre-resonance effect of the scaffold dye and aggregate formation of the hydrolysis products formed by probe-target cell interaction.The rhodol-based probes could aggregate upon reaction with the enzymes, improving their intracellular retention, and increased the SRS signal intensity during enzyme detection.In summary, the facile strategy demonstrated in this study can facilitate the development of highly specific activatable Raman probes for the simultaneous detection of multiple enzyme activities. \"Our aggregation-based molecular design strategy for Raman probes will offer substantial advantages for applications involving the investingation of enzyme activity associated with diseases and essential biological activities,\" concludes Prof. Kamiya.

  "text": "Recently, Professor Wu Dayu of Changzhou University, the user of China's Steady High Magnetic Field Facility (SHMFF), Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), together with his collaborators proposed a facile mechanical strategy to optimize the electronic structures of the catalytic center by mechanically induced spin transition, and realized a new method for designing efficient biomimetic catalysts.          The results were published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition.In recent years, the synthesis of transition-metal catalysts has received extensive attention. However, to improve catalytic activity/selectivity, it's urgent to precisely control the electronic structure of the catalytic center at the atomic level.Wu's team in-situ induced partial spin crossover (SCO) of the iron catalytic active center around the grid-like lattice from high spin (HS, S = 5/2) to low spin (LS, S = 1/2). Due to the partial SCO of the iron center, the mixed-spin (MS) nanosheet catalyst exhibited a high CO yield of 19.7 mmol g-1 and a selectivity of 91.6%, far above the high-spin counterpart.SHMFF experimental conditions were employed in this study to confirm the spin transition of the catalytic active center.Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the electron configuration of low-spin 3d orbitals effectively increased the overlap of bonding orbitals between O-2p and Fe-3dxy/dyz, thereby significantly promoting the selective adsorption of CO2. However, the high-spin 3d orbital overlapped with the O-2p orbital through the 3dz2 anti-bond orbital, which greatly weakened the bonding interaction between the catalyst and the substrate, and reduced the catalytic activity.In addition, DFT calculations showed that low-spin state played a key role in reducing the activation barrier. Researchers used electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer, Mossbauer, magnetic susceptibility and other experimental methods to analyze and characterize the electronic structure of catalysts before and after mechanical exfoliation.

  "text": "A team of researchers led by Prof. Jiang Changlong from Institute of Solid State Physics (ISSP), Hefei Institutes of Physical Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a new sensing system for detecting carbaryl residues. The research findings have been published in ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.          Carbaryl is a widely used insecticide that can easily enter the body through respiratory intake and dermal contact, resulting in serious health hazards, including carcinogenicity and reproductive abnormalities. Therefore, it is crucial to detect carbaryl residues in environmental and food samples. However, existing detection techniques such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis are time-consuming and require complex preprocessing, making them impractical for field testing.To address this issue, HFIPS researchers developed a dual-mode ratiometric fluorescent probe based on a combination of silicon quantum dots (Si QDs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe QDs). This sensing center was capable of visual quantitative detection of carbaryl with high sensitivity and immediate feedback. Upon the addition of carbaryl, the dispersion of AuNPs changed, resulting in a color change of the solution that could be observed by the naked eye.                Schematic diagram of a smartphone sensing platform detecting carbaryl. Credit: Zhang Zhong             Additionally, the fluorescence emission intensity of Si QDs increased while that of CdTe QDs decreased due to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect. The sensing system showed a dual response signal that performed a significant fluorescence color transition from red to blue under UV light. The detection limit (LOD) was as low as 16.3 nM, which was far below the maximum residue standard.The researchers then designed a portable intelligent sensing platform using 3D printing technology and color recognition, which could successfully apply the sensing system to detect carbaryl in actual samples with good selectivity and anti-interference ability.This study not only provided an advanced sensing strategy for sensitivity and rapid carbaryl detection in the field but also offered new insights into quantitative analysis of other trace analytes.Overall, the new sensing system has the potential to contribute significantly to environmental contaminant monitoring and agrifood safety.

To break nitrogen's strong bonds, the Haber-Bosch process requires roughly 80-300 atmospheres of pressure and temperatures around 572-1000 F (300-500 C). The steam-treating of natural gas involved in the process also releases ample amounts of climate-changing carbon dioxide.All told, to satisfy the current annual worldwide demand for 150 million metric tons of ammonia, the Haber-Bosch process gobbles up more than 2% of global energy and accounts for about 1% of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.In contrast, the innovative method debuted by the Stanford researchers requires less specialized circumstances.\"We were shocked to see that we could generate ammonia in benign, everyday temperature-and-pressure environments with just air and water and using something as basic as a sprayer,\" said study senior author Richard Zare, the Marguerite Blake Wilbur Professor in Natural Science and a professor of chemistry in the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences. \"If this process can be scaled up, it would represent an eco-friendly new way of making ammonia, which is one of the most important chemical processes that takes place in the world.\"The new method also uses little energy and at low cost, thus pointing a way forward to potentially producing the valuable chemical in a sustainable manner. Xiaowei Song, a postdoctoral scholar in chemistry at Stanford, is the lead author of the study, published April 10 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.New chemistry from blue-sky studyThe new chemistry discovered follows in the footsteps of pioneering work by Zare's lab in recent years examining the long-overlooked and surprisingly high reactivity of water microdroplets. In a 2019 study, Zare and colleagues novelly demonstrated that caustic hydrogen peroxide spontaneously forms in microdroplets in contact with surfaces. Experiments since have borne out a mechanism of electric charge jumping between the liquid and solid materials and generating molecular fragments, known as reactive oxygen species.Taking those findings further, Song and Zare began a collaboration with study co-author Basheer Chanbasha, a professor of chemistry at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia. Chanbasha specializes in nanomaterials for energy, petrochemical and environment applications and came to Stanford as a visiting scholar last summer.The research team zeroed in on a catalyst\u2014the term for any substance that boosts the rate of a chemical reaction but is not itself degraded or changed by the reaction\u2014that they suspected could help blaze a chemical pathway toward ammonia. The catalyst consists of an iron oxide, called magnetite, and a synthetic membrane invented in the 1960s that is composed of repeating chains of two large molecules.The researchers applied the catalyst to a Graphite mesh that Song incorporated into a gas-powered sprayer. The sprayer blasted out microdroplets in which pumped water (H2O) and compressed molecular nitrogen (N2) reacted together in the presence of the catalyst. Using a device called a mass spectrometer, Song analyzed the microdroplets' characteristics and saw the signature of ammonia in the collected data.      Low-tech, low-energy ammonia synthesisZare and colleagues were very pleased with this result, especially in light of the relatively low-tech approach. \"Our method does not require the application of any electrical voltage or form of radiation,\" said Zare.From a broader chemistry perspective, the method is remarkable in that it uses three phases of matter: nitrogen as gas, water as liquid, and catalyst as solid. \"To our knowledge, the idea of using gas, liquid, and solid all at the same time to cause a chemical transformation is a first of its kind and has a huge potential for advancing other chemical transformations,\" said Zare.While promising, the ammonia production method revealed by Zare, Song, and Chanbasha for now is only at the demonstration stage. The researchers plan to explore how to concentrate the produced ammonia as well as gauge how the process could potentially be scaled up to commercially viable levels. While Haber-Bosch is only efficient when pursued at huge facilities, the new ammonia-making method could be portable and done on-site or even on-demand at farms. That, in turn, would slash the greenhouse gas emissions related to the transportation of ammonia from far-off factories.\"With further development, we're hoping our ammonia generation method could help address the two major looming problems of continuing to feed Earth's growing population of billions of people, while still mitigating climate change,\" said Zare. \"We are hopeful and excited to continue this line of research.\"Zare is also a member of Stanford Bio-X, the Cardiovascular Institute, the Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford ChEM-H, the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, and the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute.

  "text": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are typical organic compounds found in cigarette smoke and vehicle exhaust. In addition, PAHs are produced from incomplete combustion of organic material and cooking. The highest concentrations of PM-bound PAHs ranged from 550 ng/m3 to 39,000 ng/m3, and have been observed in Chinese kitchens, fire stations, and ships.          Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may combine with ultrafine particles (UFPs) in the air to form particle-bound PAHs. PM0.1 may adsorb large amounts of toxic organic compounds, and long-term exposure to indoor UFPs from cooking has resulted in nervous responses by the human brain. PAHs have been detected in the venous blood of people exposed to combustion by-products in rural areas of China at concentrations up to 762 ng/mL.The A\u03b2 peptide contains various isoforms, with 42 amino acids in its structure. It is more abundant in human cerebrospinal fluid. It has been shown that chronic exposure of fish to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) resulted in increased concentrations of the A\u03b242 peptide in the brain, leading to a decrease in their cognitive behavior, memory locomotor and motor activity. A\u03b2 oligomers may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by damaging neurons and disrupting electrochemical signals.Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including phenanthrene, pyrene and B[a]P have increased the aggregation kinetics of the A\u03b2-peptide. Although the aggregation of A\u03b2 peptides and the formation of oligomers are enhanced in the presence of PAHs, what are the molecular interactions between A\u03b2 polypeptides and PAHs?To answer this question, researchers from Nazarbayev University, Tokyo University of Science and their teams collaborated to explore and reveal the effect of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as the major compounds of cooking particles on the structure of A\u03b242 peptide. Their study reveals that A\u03b2 polypeptides interact strongly with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of different properties, and that these organic pollutants alter the structure of A\u03b242 and promote the progression of Alzheimer's disease. This study, titled \"Effect of ambient polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nicotine on the structure of A\u03b242 protein,\" is published online in Frontiers of Environmental Science & Engineering.In this study, the research team found that the structure of the A\u03b242 peptide monomer was affected by benzo[a]pyrene, nicotine and phenanthrene molecules, depending on their hydrophobicity, size, and H-bonding capacity. The secondary structure of the A\u03b242 peptide was changed by organic pollutants, with an almost 50% decrease in the \u03b1-helix and 2%\u201310% increase in the \u03b2-sheets of the peptide. The team's results also suggested that benzo[a]pyrene, nicotine, and phenanthrene might have an effect on the progression of Alzheimer's disease.This study successfully conducted atomic and molecular dynamics studies using GROMACS to study the structure of the A\u03b242 peptide monomer in the presence of benzo[a]pyrene, nicotine and phenanthrene. This work not only analyzed the effects of organic pollutants on the results of the A\u03b2 peptide monomer at the molecular level, but also provides guidance for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and increases attention to the neurodegenerative disorders caused by air pollution.

  "answer_squad": " Haber-Bosch process",
  "text": "The Haber-Bosch process is the industrial approach for NH3 production today, which must be operated at energy-intensive high temperatures and pressures. The reduction of dinitrogen (N2) by electrocatalysis offers an alternative way for NH3 production at ambient conditions and a variety of electrocatalysts have been studied over the past few years.          However, even the best catalytic system reported could only get unsatisfied performance (such as the selectivity and production rate of NH3) due to the inertness of N2. The lithium-mediated N2 reduction reaction (Li-eN2RR) has been found to be a promising route to promote electrochemical NH3 synthesis.In this regard, a group of researchers has summarized the reaction mechanisms, the catalysts developed, and the electrolytes involved based on the most recent research progress of Li-eN2RR. They also point out the challenges and possible resolving strategies in the Li-eN2RR.This could provide a panoramic view of the related field and facilitate the development of Li-eN2RR for green NH3 production. Sun et al. published their review in Industrial Chemistry & Materials.\"The electrocatalytic reduction of N2 for the production of NH3 has been the subject of extensive research, which has been comprehensively reviewed by numerous scholars with expertise in the field,\" said corresponding author Zhenyu Sun, a professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology.\"These reviews provide detailed insights into the catalytic performance and mechanisms involved, which can be of great assistance to researchers. However, the NH3 production rate is still low, far behind the requirement of industrial application. The lithium-mediated N2 reduction reaction (Li-eN2RR) holds great potential for the production of NH3 under ambient conditions.\"\"Therefore, we provide this comprehensive overview to summarize the recent progress of Li-eN2RR. This review demonstrates the basic aspects of Li-eN2RR including the common composition of electrolytes, suppression of hydrogen evolution, reaction mechanism, the reported electrocatalysts, and the challenges and prospects, which can be helpful to new individuals in this field as well as serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals alike.\"      The rate-determining step in the synthesis of NH3 is often the adsorption and activation of N2. However, due to the inertness of N2, it is extremely hard to break the N\u2261N triple bond. In the Li-eN2RR process, Li can be used as a mediator to fix N2 as Li3N, which subsequently converts to NH3.\"There have been different viewpoints on the reaction mechanism of Li-eN2RR. We provide detailed analysis of the reported mechanisms,\" Sun said.Three different mechanisms, including chemical N2 splitting and chemical protonation, N2 activation and protonation through an associative mechanism, and chemical N2 splitting and electrochemical protonation were introduced with their respective reaction steps.The section about the reaction mechanisms of Li-eN2RR demonstrates the different routes of N2 activation and hydrogenation to NH3 production. \"Through the different mechanisms, we can have a comprehensive understanding of Li-eN2RR, which can guide the catalytic system design.\"The rational design of electrocatalysts is crucial for Li-eN2RR. There have been some strategies for the engineering of the electrodes to get enhanced performance.\"The electrocatalysts together with their design strategies were categorized based on the metal species involved,\" Sun said.\"Different kinds of electrocatalysts including noble metal catalysts such as Ru, Ag, Au; nonprecious metal catalysts such as copper-based materials, molybdenum, lithium-liquid alloy-salt, stainless steel cloth; and non-metal catalysts such as carbon-based materials were comprehensively overviewed. It was discussed in detail about their performance and the catalytic active sites in Li-eN2RR, which may enlighten the design of the future catalysts towards efficient NH3 production.\"Another important part of Li-eN2RR is the electrolytes. According to Zhenyu Sun, more attention should be given to the study of electrolytes in electrocatalytic N2 reduction considering the significance of electrolytes for the reaction and for N2 dissolution.Some Li-containing electrolytes have been developed for Li-eN2RR, yet more efforts still need to be devoted to further improving the NH3 yield. This requires the synergistic work between the electrolytes and the electrocatalysts as well as the study of their interface.\"The primary objective of this review is to provide readers with a clear understanding of the current research progress of Li-eN2RR, which is still in its early stage yet promising for electrocatalytic NH3 production. We also highlight the challenges and propose strategies to overcome them. We hope it is helpful to promote the development of Li-eN2RR towards green NH3 production,\" Sun said.

  "text": "Autologous and allogeneic bone grafts are considered the gold standard when it comes to reconstructing bones, largely due to their bioactive compounds and osteoblastic cells that can generate new bone effectively. However, limited supply, donor-site complications, and risk of disease transmission have deterred its widespread use.          In contrast, xenograft materials represent a feasible alternative because they are safe to use and come in abundance; even though they stem from mammalian tissue which is costly, poses environmental risks and ethical issues especially in underprivileged regions. Nonetheless, xenograft materials do have their limitations. Most commercialized xenograft materials are prepared from mammalian tissue with heavy bio-cost, environmental pollution and potential ethical issues, especially in underdeveloped areas.Therefore, a top priority of bone graft materials development is to obtain safe, modifiable, and environmentally friendly synthetic biomaterials capable of replacing natural graft materials\u2014the exact motivation that spurred a new discovery by an international team of researchers.Recently, a research team developed a dissolution-precipitation method to convert eggshells into endotoxin-free and immunocompatible amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) particles.\"Eggshells is an ideal raw material to synthesize bone graft materials as it contains plenty of calcium and phosphorous components,\" said first author of the study, Dr. Qianli Ma Qianli Ma the Department of Biomaterials at the University of Oslo (UiO). \"In addition, some trace elements associated with bone regeneration, such as magnesium and strontium, are also found in eggshell.\"                Osteogenic eggshell acp materials in 3d spheroids: eggshell acp encourages osteoblasts to produce a large amount of opn and collagen i for supporting bone formation.

In the model, ACP materials were observed to interact with osteoblasts more realistically, and were safe, cell-friendly and effective in promoting bone regeneration.\"This technique promises to create an unlimited supply of bioactive and sustainable bone graft materials while reducing the environmental pollution,\" said senior and corresponding author Professor H\u00e5vard Jostein Haugen, who is from the same department at UiO. \"The osteoblastic spheroids constructed in the study provided a more practical biomaterial research model, reflecting the three-dimensional interactions between cells and biomaterials.\"The researchers hope their latest findings, published in Smart Materials in Medicine, will inspire further work on converting ordinary food waste into high value-added biomaterials. Meanwhile, the team is working towards an ideal in vitro model that can replace in vivo research in animal models.

  "text": "Excessive use of fossil energy causes global warming and other environmental problems. To reduce the greenhouse effect, two major greenhouse gases-CO2 and CH4 as the feedback are used to produce syngas (CO and H2) by CO2-CH4 reforming technique (DRM).       The key to DRM is the choice of catalyst. The catalyst for DRM reaction mainly consists of two parts: the active metal and the support, in which a suitable support plays an important role in promoting the reaction activity and stability. Currently, ZrO2 is considered as a promising catalyst support due to the presence of oxygen vacancies. However, studies on the effect of oxygen vacancies on the ZrO2 surface for CO2 adsorption and activation processes are still lacking.A research group of Juntian Niu from Taiyuan University of Technology investigated the effect of oxygen vacancies for the adsorption and activation of CO2 on the surface ZrO2 by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.They found that the oxygen vacancies contribute greatly to both the adsorption and activation of CO2, and the essence lies in oxygen vacancies greatly facilitate the charge transfer from the ZrO2 surface to the CO2 molecule. Additionally, it was found that t-ZrO2 with the presence of oxygen vacancies is most favorable to the adsorption and activation of CO2 by the comparison of different ZrO2 crystalline phases.The new findings elucidated the role of oxygen vacancies in CO2 adsorption and activation for the preparation of high-performance DRM reaction catalysts using ZrO2. Meanwhile, it provided guidance for the design of CO2 high-efficient catalysts at an atomic level.These findings were published in Frontiers in Energy.

  "answer_squad": " Enhanced utilization of bark by means of cascade processing",
  "text": "The extractives and chemical composition of hybrid aspen bark allow it to be used in several applications in the chemical industry. In the doctoral dissertation of Pasi Korkalo, who is a researcher at the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) and a doctoral student at the University of Oulu's Sustainable Chemistry unit, the chemical composition of the bark biomass of hybrid aspen was studied, activated carbon was produced from the bark extract, and a pesticide chemical was produced from the bark's hemicellulose. All chemical products were separated from the biomass following cascade processing principles.          The hybrid aspen tree, a species that originated from the crossbreeding of European and American aspen, was introduced to Finland in the 1950s. Its fast growth made it an attractive raw material for the wood industry. However, the hybrid aspen did not reach the same value as other dominant tree species in the market, as the market changed significantly before the cultivated hybrid aspen plantations were ready for harvesting.\"Currently, hybrid aspen is seen as an opportunity to increase diversity in conifer-dominated forests. Applied chemistry can explore new uses and added value of the trees,\" says Pasi Korkalo.Enhanced utilization of bark by means of cascade processingThe extractives and chemical structure of hybrid aspen bark make it suitable for various applications in the chemical industry. The goal of the doctoral research was to produce different fractions from the same bark biomass for further processing, by using the cascade processing principle.First, rigid carbon foam was produced from hybrid aspen bark extracts, which can replace fossil-based foam chemicals in insulation or filler applications that require heat tolerance. Rigid foam also works well as a starting material for activated carbon.After separating the extractives from the bark, the extraction residue was further utilized by torrefication, i.e., roasting in oxygen-free conditions. The method produced a distillate that was found to be an effective chemical in controlling certain weeds and fungal diseases of plant crops. The study found that hot water extraction of bark , that was applied to separate raw material for the foams, improved the performance of the chemical produced from the extraction residue against weeds.Finally, after the production of chemicals, torrefied bark biomass still remained, which could be further utilized as a raw material for biochar or in energy production.Korkalo concludes, \"By using cascade processing of the bark, several possibilities for use and added value can be achieved from a single raw material source. This, in turn, can arouse new interest in the possibilities of using hybrid aspen and the biomass separated from the species.\"In cascade processing, different value components and bioproducts are separated from the raw material, i.e., the main or side stream of biomass, by sequentially connected technological unit processes. The entire biomass is fully utilized into products, nutrients, and energy of the highest possible added value, while avoiding the creation of new unused by-products.

  "answer_race": " A catalyst that can produce hydrogen and purify water at the same time.",
  "question_squad": " What is the most common way to generate hydrogen?",
  "answer_squad": " water electrolysis",
  "text": "University of Alberta researchers have developed a new catalyst that could revolutionize how we generate power and purify water. When placed in any type of water and provided with a small amount of power, the catalyst produces hydrogen that can be fed into a fuel cell to generate electricity along with distilled water that is safe to drink.          The catalyst was discovered almost entirely by chance when Robin Hamilton was creating an electrode for an undergraduate student working on a waste biomass upcycling project. He mixed up a combination of powders and allowed them to sit overnight in water, intending to finish the cell the following day. When he returned in the morning, the mixture was bubbling\u2014a reaction that was extremely out of the ordinary.\"It ends up being that when you mix these two things together, they interact, they work together and hydrogen comes off. It floored us,\" says Hamilton, a senior research associate in the Department of Chemistry.Hamilton consulted chemistry professors Jeff Stryker and Jonathan Veinot, sharing the unexpected discovery and drawing on their respective expertise. The team quickly realized they had something remarkable on their hands\u2014the specific combination of powders could serve as a new type of catalyst.The catalyst they created is made with material that is non-toxic and plentiful. It's easy and inexpensive to produce, making it an affordable and accessible alternative to current catalysts on the market, which require materials that are expensive and in limited supply.Their catalyst can also be used with any type of water, another factor that gives it an edge over current ways to generate hydrogen, such as water electrolysis.\"There's a scarcity of potable water and that's the biggest problem with water electrolysis to generate hydrogen\u2014you have to use clean water,\" says Hamilton. \"With this, you don't. We take something that is dirty, that you can't drink, and generate hydrogen and electricity in a fuel cell. And it spits out water you can drink.\"\"You could turn oil sands tailings ponds into usable fuel while purifying the water. It sounds incredulous, it sounds like it's too good to be true, but it's not,\" adds Veinot.In addition to the catalyst being a marked improvement on the current catalysts available, it also transforms what is typically an energy-intensive process into something that can be achieved with far lower temperatures and less energy input.      The new catalyst-driven process also results in little oxygen, making it less volatile than current methods. As Hamilton explains, when using a hydrogen fuel cell, the most common method to generate hydrogen is through water electrolysis. This process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen, separates them, then recombines them in the fuel cell to generate electricity.\"You mix hydrogen and oxygen and reach certain concentrations, that's an explosive mixture. So you have to separate them to be able to use it safely. With our method, we sequester the oxygen without these expensive membrane separators that are normally used, and we can generate the hydrogen and have it go directly into the fuel cell. You don't have to separate it,\" says Hamilton.\"Think about having your garden hose providing you with the water that can be converted basically on demand to the fuel you want. It takes away transport, it takes away storage, it takes away negative explosive possibilities,\" adds Veinot.The researchers are initially looking to craft off-grid devices that could help remote communities or aid in disaster relief, when access to natural gas and potable water is an issue.

  "text": "Cellular respiration is a complex and highly regulated process that allows cells to draw energy from nutrition. An international team of scientists in Finland, Germany and Poland have investigated the important role of long-chain fatty acids in guiding this process. The findings, published in Nature Communications, will shed light on the understanding of mitochondrial function that involve disruptions in cellular energy metabolism.          They are tiny and highly efficient energy factories operating inside our cells. Often referred to as \"powerhouses,\" mitochondria extract most cellular energy from nutrition. Researchers from the University of Oulu, (Finland), the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS, Germany), and the University of Warsaw (Poland) have now succeeded in demonstrating how long-chain fatty acids regulate the amount of energy drawn in this process called cellular respiration. The discovery is ground-breaking as the importance of long-chain fatty acids produced by mitochondria in cellular respiration had not been previously known and the results open up a completely novel approach.\"This information helps us understand diseases that involve impaired mitochondrial function and cellular respiration much better than before,\" says M. Tanvir Rahman from the University of Oulu and lead author on the paper.The study is part of a more extensive research project investigating the connection between cellular respiration and the cell's nutritional state. The scientists used a protein engineering method, in which the mutants of the so-called MECR enzyme involved in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis were designed using computational molecular modeling, along with structure determination by crystallography, and other experiments to validate the predictions. \"Our study is an example of a successful case of targeted protein modification,\" says researcher Kaija Autio from the University of Oulu.The experiments in this interdisciplinary study were carried out by biochemists and crystallographers from the Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine of the University of Oulu and Biocenter Oulu, while the molecular modeling was done by computational biophysicists from the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS) and the University of Warsaw. \"This study really demonstrates the value of combining computational and experimental approaches to reveal complex biomolecular mechanisms,\" says Rebecca Wade from HITS.

  "text": "Recently, a research team led by Prof. Wu Zhengyan and Zhang Jia from Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) developed a portable electrochemical lead ion (Pb2+) sensor based on cobalt-doped Prussian blue (CoPB) combining MXene material, which possesses an enormous potential for Pb2+ detection in practical applications.       The results were published in Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry.As a representative heavy metal ion pollutant, Pb2+ seriously affects the ecological environment and human health even at low concentration due to its high toxicity and easy accumulation in plants and animals. A direct and real-time detection for trace levels of Pb2+ appear to be particularly important in environmental waters.In this research, the team presented the development of a portable electrochemical sensor for detecting lead ions using CoPB combined with MXene.The composites of CoPB-MXene exhibited superior conductivity and stability, enabling a linear detection range of 1-200 nM at low deposition potential, with an ultra-low detection limit of 0.97 nM.After investigating the influence of various operating conditions, including deposition time, buffer solution, and pH value, on the sensor performance, researchers determined optimal conditions, which helped CoPB-MXene/GCE exhibit excellent repeatability, high anti-interference, and remarkable reproducibility.

  "answer_squad": " MOFs for electrocatalysis: From performance enhancement to future development outlook",
  "text": "Electrocatalysis as an efficient energy storage and conversion technology opens up a new path to solve the existing problems of energy depletion and environmental pollution caused by fossil fuel consumption. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of crystalline porous materials with high specific surface area, high porosity, and designable structure, have shown great potential as new electrocatalysts. However, the inherent low electrical conductivity and low stability of MOFs have greatly hindered their further application in electrocatalysis.          How to design and synthesize highly stable and conductive MOFs materials, and regulate the energy of MOFs electrocatalytic reaction intermediates and the adsorption strength of active species are the keys to enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. Based on the above ideas, a large number of MOFs-based electrocatalysts have been newly reported in recent years. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a timely summary of the latest progress. Li et al. published their review in Industrial Chemistry & Materials.\"The development of efficient, green, and low-cost metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-based electrocatalysts is crucial to address the existing energy depletion and environmental pollution problems caused by fossil fuel consumption,\" said Jiandong Pang, a professor at Nankai University.\"In this review, we systematically summarized the research progress on the application of MOFs materials in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), hydrogen oxidation reactions (HOR), oxygen evolution reactions (OER), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), and nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) according to the categories of monometallic MOFs, bimetallic MOFs, MOF-based composites and MOFs as supports, thus revealing the structure-property relationships.\"\"Strategies to enhance the stability and conductivity of MOFs-based electrocatalytic materials are also summarized. We also provided an outlook on the opportunities and challenges facing MOFs in electrocatalysis and list the problems that need to be explored and solved.\"As a new type of crystalline porous material, MOFs are known for their various predictable and designable structures, high surface area, guest-accessible voids, and easily functionalized channels. MOFs materials are currently used in a wide range of different electrocatalytic reactions, including HER, HOR, ORR, and OER.These reactions are at the heart of the following devices or cells: metal air cells, renewable fuel cells, electrolytic water to hydrogen devices, and other important electrochemical energy conversion devices. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen to ammonia also shows attractive applications in the field of energy conversion.      Despite the many unique advantages of the above electrocatalytic reactions, their cost must be carefully considered in order to achieve commercialization. Therefore, it is essential and urgent to design green, low energy consuming, and highly stable MOFs electrocatalysts from both efficiency and cost perspectives.\"The synthesis of MOFs with predictable structures and high stability has been an important goal in the field of MOF research. A clear strategy to guide the design of ligands and metals will help to develop novel functionalized MOFs and provide a fire-new reference for various fields,\" Pang said.\"Synthesis with the same reactants may lead to MOFs with different topologies and properties, and the reaction time, method, and temperature of synthesis will also affect the crystal structure, morphology, and pore environment of MOFs, which will further affect the performance of the materials. There are two common adjustment directions for the synthesis of MOF-based electrocatalysts, i.e., tuning the size of MOFs and modulating the conductivity of MOFs.\"\"Furthermore, based on the diversity of metal ions and ligands, specific metal centers and ligands containing specific organic functional groups can be selected to design and synthesize MOFs with high stability under catalytic environment and applied to the study of electrocatalysis. To make MOFs with high stability, researchers generally choose to construct frameworks using carboxylate-based ligands (hard Lewis bases) and high-valent metal ions (hard Lewis acids, such as Al3+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Ti4+, and Zr4+) or azo-based ligands (soft Lewis bases) and low-valent transition metal ions (soft Lewis acids, such as Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) based on hard-soft-acid-base (HSAB) theory. The designed MOF possesses high stability and will greatly enhance its electrocatalytic performance,\" said Xian-He Bu, a professor at Nankai University.Pang said that there is still great scope for optimizing MOFs materials for future electrocatalytic designs. Incorporating catalytically active ligands (e.g. porphyrins) into MOFs and modulating the catalytic effect by adjusting the pore environment and pore structure is an effective strategy to enhance electrocatalytic performance. In addition, the formation of MOFs with bimetallic active sites using binuclear metal clusters/ions to optimize the electronic structure and surface state of the metal centers is also a feasible strategy.To maximize the benefits of MOFs, the use of MOFs as supports for loading metal nanoparticles or metal monoatoms and the compounding of MOFs with inorganic active materials are also suggested strategies.\"In this review, our main goal is to provide readers with timely and accurate updates on the latest research advances and electrocatalytic performance enhancement strategies in the field, while providing an outlook for future developments in the field,\" Bu said.

Their research results were published in Journal of Materials Chemistry C.The misuse of biochemical molecules can cause significant environmental problems, so developing low-cost sensors for detecting these molecules is essential.The sensor they've developed is called the high-throughput near-infrared surface-enhanced Raman scattering (HNIR-SERS) biochemical sensor. It's a combination of inkjet printing technology and plasma metal nanoparticles that enables high-sensitivity detection of multiple biochemical molecules in one substrate.To develop this sensor, researchers utilized imprinting technology to fabricate a grid substrate with separated regions arranged in a typical cubic pattern.They then assembled porous Au@AuAg nanorods on the substrate using inkjet printing, resulting in the formation of the HNIR-SERS sensor. This new type of sensor achieves high sensitivity and specificity in detecting multiple biochemical molecules on one substrate.The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of the HNIR-SERS sensor by detecting 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP), rhodamine 6G (R6G), methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) with an enhancement factor of 108 for 4-ATP.This development provides an effective method for realizing high-throughput and low-cost NIR-SERS sensors and could pave the way for practical applications in Raman detection chips.

  "answer_squad": " RNA ligases",
  "text": "Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are single-stranded molecules that play an essential role in the cells of all living organisms. As \"transcripts\" of our genes, mRNAs, for example, are involved in the translation of genetic information by carrying in their own sequence the instructions for the creation of a protein. \"In order to fulfill their diverse functions in the cell, RNAs often need to be chemically modified after their creation or repaired after damage,\" explains Andreas Marx, professor of organic and cellular chemistry at the University of Konstanz.          One chemical reaction that plays a role here is the three-step linking (ligation) of two RNA strands at their respective opposite ends. This reaction is triggered by specialized enzymes called RNA ligases and is present in all forms of life, from viruses to fungi and plants. In vertebrates, including humans, such RNA ligases had yet to be identified.An interdisciplinary research team from Konstanz has now discovered the first human RNA ligase of this type, the protein C12orf29. At the cellular level, the study results, published in Nature Communications, suggest a protective function of the enzyme against cellular stress.Antioxidant defense system of our cells\"We noticed C12orf29 during extensive studies of human lung carcinoma and kidney cells that we performed in search of proteins with a specific chemical signature and for which we used new chemical tools. It caught our attention because until then it was not understood what the protein's functions were,\" Marx says.The researchers therefore developed and used various protocols to purify and predict the structure of the unexplored protein and performed experiments to track down its chemical function. They were thus able to prove what was initially only a reasonable suspicion: C12orf29 links RNA strands using adenosine triphosphate (ATP).The researchers were able to show in detail that this process follows a characteristic, three-step reaction pattern known from other RNA ligases of other life forms. To learn more about the function of C12orf29 at the cellular level, the researchers went one step further after elucidating the chemical mechanism.\"We used the CRISPR/Cas gene scissors to generate a line of human kidney cells in which the gene encoding C12orf29 was knocked out. We were then able to compare these knockout (KO) cells with 'normal' kidney cells under varying experimental conditions,\" Marx explains.In particular, when treating the cells with menadione, a K vitamin, clear differences were observed between KO cells and the wild-type cells with functional RNA ligase: Comparatively low concentrations of menadione were sufficient to damage KO cells. In contrast, the wild-type cells were only damaged at significantly higher concentrations.Since menadione is known to cause oxidative stress, the researchers concluded from this result that C12orf29 protects against oxidative cellular stress. \"We assume that a previously hidden human RNA repair mechanism underlies this biological function of C12orf29. We now need to examine this mechanism in further studies,\" Marx says. More information:Yizhi Yuan et al, Chemoproteomic discovery of a human RNA ligase, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "The introduction of rare earth elements into TiO2 can effectively improve the electron-hole separation of TiO2 and prolong the visible light response of TiO2.          Cerium (Ce) shows variable valence states Ce3+/Ce4+ with different electronic structures (4f15d0 and 4f05d0, respectively) among rare earth elements, which easily form oxygen vacancies. Ce element with unique electronic structure can be used to modify semiconductor photocatalysts to improve their photocatalytic performance.In a study published in Molecules, the research group led by Prof. Lu Canzhong from Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, reported the visible light absorption of Ce/TiO2.The researchers achieved simultaneous doping of Ce in the TiO2 lattice using a simple sol-gel method which achieved Ce synchronous doping in the lattice of TiO2. They observed morphology and structure of the pure TiO2, Ce-doped TiO2 (Ce/TiO2), and CeO2-mixed TiO2 (CeO2-TiO2) samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). They found that Ce doping in the lattice of anatase TiO2 resulted in a smaller grain size of the sample.Additionally, the researchers revealed the high photocurrent density (10.9 \u03bcA\u00d7cm-2) of Ce/TiO2 by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test, which is 2.5 times that of common TiO2 material (4.3 \u03bcA\u00d7cm-2). They evaluated the light absorption range of Ce/TiO2 using incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) test. Ce/TiO2 shows visible light absorption up to 500 nm, while pure TiO2 shows no obvious response in the visible region.Moreover, the researchers unveiled that the electron-trapping centers formed by Ce doping into the TiO2 lattice improved the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes. The narrow bandgap of Ce-doped TiO2 showed excellent visible light absorption and photocurrent response. Due to the Ce doping, the Ce/TiO2 samples achieved high photocurrent density and incident photon current efficiency (IPCE).This study provides a practical strategy and an important reference for the preparation and understanding of highly efficient visible light-activated rare earth-doped photocatalysts.

Textiles with antimicrobial properties could reduce the use of antibiotics. On February 28, Tuser Biswas defended his doctoral thesis Enzyme Printed Fabrics: Bio-functionalisation of Synthetic Textiles by Digital Inkjet PrintingThe conventional textile industry devours natural resources in the form of water, energy, and chemicals. A more resource-efficient way to produce textiles is with ink jet printing. Tuser Biswas, who recently defended his doctoral thesis in Textile Material Technology, seeks to develop methods for functional textiles. He has shown that it is possible to print enzymes on textiles. These are proteins that function as catalysts in the body, as they set chemical processes in motion without themselves changing. They could, for example, be used in medical textiles with antimicrobial properties or to measure biological or chemical reactions.\"Ever since the industrial revolution, our society has used an abundance of synthetic and harsh chemicals.

Tuser Biswas explained that the most important result is to show how a printed enzyme could bind another enzyme to the surface of a fabric. Although the activity of the enzymes decreased by 20%\u201330% after printing, the results are still promising for future applications. At the same time, the work has provided new knowledge about many fundamental questions about printing biomaterials on fabric.\"Before starting the project, we found several related studies that focused on producing a finished product.

  "answer_squad": " eosin Y",
  "text": "National University of Singapore (NUS) scientists have demonstrated that stepwise customized functionalization of multihydrosilanes to access fully substituted silicon compounds can be realized using neutral eosin Y, an inexpensive dye molecule.          The development of a unified catalytic platform for stepwise and programmable functionalization of multihydrosilanes is highly challenging. However, having this platform will facilitate the rational design of organosilanes with predictable functions, in which bespoke silane molecules are required.Three specific requirements need to be simultaneously realized through a single catalytic system: (i) the selective and preferable hydrogen atom abstraction of silicon-hydrogen (Si-H) bonds in the presence of various activated carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds; (ii) a diverse range of Si-H functionalisations; and (iii) highly selective monofunctionalization of di- and trihydrosilanes.In a recent paper, Associate Professor Jie WU and his colleagues from the Department of Chemistry, NUS, have developed a new method for synthesizing organosilanes, a family of chemical compounds which have a variety of applications from organic and polymer synthesis, materials science, medicinal chemistry, to agriculture.The researchers used eosin Y, a low-cost, readily available dye molecule, as a photocatalyst to selectively remove hydrogen atoms from hydrosilanes. This enables different functional chemical groups to be attached to the silicon atom in a step by step manner, potentially creating a wide variety of useful silicon compounds. An amount of energy of approximately 90 kcal/mol is required to break a Si-H bond, and the uniqueness of this catalyst is that it uses much lower energy (~63 kcal/mol) to break the Si-H bond.Also, unlike other photocatalysts, eosin Y is able to selectively break the Si-H bonds rather than some more reactive C-H bonds. More than eight different new chemical transformations have been realized by the research team using various commodity feedstocks as the starting materials to react with hydrosilanes.These findings were published in the journal Nature Chemistry.The researchers also used a continuous microflow reactor for the monofunctionalization of di- and trihydrosilanes, which resulted in high selectivity and yield. Unlike conventional bath reactors, the continuous microflow reactor allows for high mixing efficiency and precise residence time control. Also, this process is highly scalable. The use of eosin Y with microflow reactor offers a convenient strategy for stepwise decoration of silicon atoms to access silanes with four different substituents in a programmable and on-demand manner.The research team plans to extend the strategy to generate chiral silicon reagents, and to apply this method to materials/polymers containing Si-H bonds for post-functionalization purposes. They are also working towards fully automating the on-demand synthesis of multifunctional silanes.Prof Wu said, \"We would like to establish a general and sustainable strategy to synthesize functional organosilanes in an efficient, on-demand, and fully automated fashion. With this method, the preparation of desired silicon reagents will be more easily accessible, and in future, chemists can focus their energies on the design and development of functional silicon molecules limited only by their imagination.\" More information:Xuanzi Fan et al, Stepwise on-demand functionalization of multihydrosilanes enabled by a hydrogen-atom-transfer photocatalyst based on eosin Y, Nature Chemistry (2023).

  "text": "Inspired by the mechanism behind light-sensitive sunglasses, a team led by a North Carolina State University researcher invented a family of fluorescent dyes to illuminate biological processes at a very small scale\u2014comparable in size to human hair.          The researchers described the mechanism behind the dyes in a publication in ACS Applied Optical Materials, led by Yang Zhang, assistant professor of textile engineering, chemistry and science at NC State.The Abstract spoke to Zhang about how the dyes work.The Abstract: How do these dyes work?Yang Zhang: We designed a family of dyes called \"photoactivatable fluorophores.\" These fluorescent dye molecules change color when they're hit by blue light irradiation. The dyes change color because part of the dye structure is photosensitive, and light irradiation changes their molecular structure. The dye conformations will emit light on a greener spectrum initially, and will emit red light after irradiation.TA: How do the dyes fluoresce?Zhang: It's like when human beings eat food, we absorb energy so we can do work, and then we go to bed to relax. After the molecule absorbs the energy, it wants to relax back to its ground state, so it relaxes and throws out the photons. The microscopic biological world is dark, and these dyes help to illuminate the biological processes with a microscope.TA: How do you use them to illuminate microscopic processes?Zhang: We designed these dyes to be used with microscopy in basic biomedical research, although they have not been used in humans. We used the dyes to illuminate tiny transport molecules, or nanocarriers, diffusing within developing nematodes, or in developing flies. Those are typically hard to image using any other approaches.Currently, we are exploring our dyes for single-molecule imaging, building upon work that won three scientists the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2014. This technique helps biomedical researchers investigate complicated life processes down to the nanoscale\u2014in other words, at the molecular level.TA: Do dyes like this exist already, and if so, how are the ones you worked on different?Zhang: The dyes we worked on are brighter, and we think they are safer. That's because they emit light in the near-infrared region. You want to avoid having irradiation absorbed into tissue or cells. Also, we excite the cells by hitting them with light at a longer wavelength, so at a lower energy level. That will avoid heating up the cells, and potentially killing them. Our next steps are to look more closely at the phototoxicity levels to see how these dyes can be used more widely for single-molecule imaging.

  "question_race": " What is the purpose of the passage?",
  "answer_race": " To introduce a new research on TB.",
  "question_squad": " What is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide?",
  "answer_squad": " TB",
  "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide that is spread in the air like the common cold. TB is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and was responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Mtb will usually attack the lungs but can attack any part of the body.          Drug resistant TB strains are spreading and present a major concern. New work and a paper by a team of scientists from Manchester, Cambridge and Huddersfield Universities using a structure-guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization obtained a series of compounds with activity against clinically relevant drug-resistant isolates. These will support further development of much-needed additional treatment options against Mtb.During infection the TB bacteria can utilize lipids (cholesterol and fatty acids) from the human host to act as nutrients to maintain and fuel the infectious state.  The teams' paper, just published in Chemistry\u2014A European Journal, outlines this collaborative project and the results of their research into a set of enzymes involved in a key step in the breakdown of host cholesterol used by the TB bacteria.Called \"Structure Based Discovery of Inhibitors of CYP125 and CYP142 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis,\" their work involves characterizing the enzymes using the UK's national synchrotron, Diamond Light Source X-ray macromolecular crystallography beamlines to view their structures in molecular detail.Corresponding author, Dr. Kirsty McLean Senior Lecturer in Cell Biology/Biochemistry in the Department of Biological and Geographical Sciences, University of Huddersfield explained that these enzyme structures are used to design inhibitor molecules that can bind to the enzymes and prevent them doing their job\u2014essential for TB infection.The inhibitors molecules initially came from screening a library of small chemical compounds and were then gradually built up and synthesized chemically designing them to sit specifically into the enzyme structure. This process iteratively combines protein structure knowledge and chemical synthesis to design a succession of better inhibitors. The leading compounds were tested against clinically active and drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and revealed anti-TB activity.\"Using a structure-guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization, compounds with micromolar range in-cell activity against clinically relevant drug-resistant isolates were obtained. These will support further development of much-needed additional treatment options and provide routes to probe the role of CYP125 and CYP142 in Mtb pathogenesis. This study should incite further development of an alternative range of anti-TB inhibitors,\" adds Dr. McLean.Dave Hall, Science Group Leader for Diamond's Macromolecular Crystallography Group concludes, \"Much of the team's X-ray diffraction data was collected and managed using tools for remote access to our beamlines and new shift modes. Our staff worked closely with the group across various of our beamlines including I03, I04, I04-1 and I24. We are delighted to have helped move this important research on to the next stage.\"With the emergence of extensive drug resistance, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed, and continued drug discovery efforts required. Host-derived lipids such as cholesterol support Mtb growth, and are also suspected to function in immunomodulation, with links to persistence and immune evasion. Mtb cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes facilitate key steps in cholesterol catabolism and thus present potential targets for inhibition.The authors present a series of compounds based on an ethyl 5-(pyridin-4-yl)-1H-indole-2-carboxylate pharmacophore, which bind strongly to both Mtb cholesterol oxidases CYP125 and CYP142.

  "question_race": " What is the passage mainly about?",
  "answer_race": " A new kind of tissue scaffold.",
  "question_squad": " What is the basic protein that makes up the intercellular matrix?",
  "answer_squad": " Collagen",
  "text": "Collagen is the basic protein that makes up the intercellular matrix, or in other words, the environment for the connective tissue cells of our body, such as tendons, bone, and cartilage. It looks like long threads, woven into three-dimensional networks. This, in turn, creates a kind of a tissue scaffold.          Due to the fact that collagen fibers are durable, elastic, and also serve as signals that determine the cell's so-called destiny, in medicine they are used as an environment to accelerate growth and differentiation of tissues, for example in wound healing. Most often such materials are artificially synthesized from collagen dissolution. However, even the most advanced technologies are unable to create collagen \"networks\" that exactly repeat the structure of a natural cellular environment, most favorable for its regeneration, or in other words, tissue repair.Scientists from Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University (Kaliningrad) with their colleagues from Voronezh State University (Voronezh) have proposed to use natural collagen extracted from Dosidicus gigas squid as tissue scaffold for growing cells instead of artificially synthesized collagen.This large marine animal is the most popular commercial species of squid that is used in cooking and also by scientists when studying animal brain and behavior. With regard to the availability and high volumes of Dosidicus gigas catch (up to 700 tons a year), this species may yet become a source of collagen for medical purposes on an industrial scale.                Structure of the scaffold material. Credit: Evgeny Chupakhin             The authors have extracted collagen from the squid's skin, then the protein was blended with glycerin and water and dried in a special chamber, in order to shape it in the form of a scaffold. The durability and elasticity of the resulting fibrous material was then tested by stretching the sample. It turned out that the material's mechanical properties matched those already used as cell scaffolds in regenerative medicine.Analysis of amino acid sequence, which is part of the protein, has shown that the Dosidicus gigas collagen is similar to mammal collagen, making it possible to be used when working wit human cell cultures with no risk of rejection.In order to experimentally prove that the squid scaffold is suitable for growing human cells, scientists have placed samples into small plastic nutrient-filled walls, and afterwards applied human stem cell cultures onto their surfaces.      Cell culture observation has shown that in four days the cells strongly bound to the collagen scaffold, forming a big network with each other. Besides that, cells began to actively interact with the substrate, transforming it and releasing extracellular matrix into the environment\u2014molecules which play an important role in tissue restoration. The authors have also concluded that squid collagen has no toxic effect, since the median survival of cells that were cultivated there was 90%.\"The technology of creating collagen scaffolds of squid protein is quite simple, and therefore can be easily used at an industrial scale. The experiments have shown that our proposed material has high durability and elasticity, it is biocompatible, non-toxic, and also contributes to growth, division and migration of human embryonic cells. This suggests that it can be considered a promising replacement for synthetic collagen, currently used in modern regenerative medicine,\" says Evgeny Chupakhin, associate professor of PSC Institute of Medicine and Life Sciences at Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University.The results of the work have already attracted the interest of the industry. For example, only one company, Varseas, produces collagen of the described type in Russia.The study is published in the journal Polymers.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the chatbot that is already helping materials engineers?",
  "answer_squad": " ChatGPT",
  "text": "The artificial intelligence developer OpenAI promises to reshape the way people work and learn with its new chatbot called ChatGPT. At the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, in fact, the large language model is already aiding materials engineers, who are harnessing its power to quickly and cost-effectively extract information from scientific literature.          For several years, Dane Morgan, a professor of materials science and engineering at UW\u2013Madison, has used machine learning, a type of data-based AI, in his lab to evaluate and search for new types of materials with great success. Maciej Polak, a staff scientist who works closely with Morgan, brainstormed other tasks AI might help with.\"AI can increasingly help with tasks that are quite complex and time consuming,\" says Polak. \"And we thought, 'What is something materials scientists do very often that we wish we had more time for?' One key thing is reading papers to get data.\"Polak says materials scientists often download and then comb through long research papers to search for one small group of numbers to add to their data sets.\"We thought we could just offload all of these time-consuming tasks onto an AI that could read those papers for us and give us that information,\" says Polak.Asking chatbots, even powerful ones like ChatGPT, to simply look for and extract data from the full text of a paper remains beyond their capabilities. So Polak refined the technique, asking the bots to review sentence by sentence and decide whether each contained relevant data or not\u2014a task that boiled papers down to one or two key sentences. He then asked the bots to present the information in a table form, at which point a human researcher could review the table and sentences to make sure they were correct and relevant. The technique yielded an accuracy rate of about 90%, allowing the researchers to extract data from a set of papers to create a database on the critical cooling rates for metallic glasses.In February 2023, Polak, Morgan and colleagues posted a paper about the technique on the arXiv preprint server.While the technique reduced the researchers' paper-reading workload by about 99%, Polak was interested in improving it even more.\"I was the person still doing that last, manual step\u2014checking the accuracy of the tables,\" he says. \"So, I wanted to find a way to fully automate this process.\"      To get to that point, the team engaged in \"prompt\" engineering\u2014figuring out the exact questions and sequence that would cause the bot to extract and then double-check the information they wanted. They applied their initial approach to extracted the data table, and then they asked the bot a series of follow-up questions to introduce the possibility that the data set was wrong. That forced the AI to double back, recheck the data and flag mistakes. In the vast majority of cases, the AI was able to identify faulty information.\"That's the most important thing; it can admit it made a mistake,\" says Polak. \"Maybe it doesn't know how to fix it, but at least we're not getting factually incorrect information.\"The team released a separate paper on this iteration of the technique on arXiv in March 2023.Morgan says this type of prompt engineering with ChatGPT and other large language models feels unusual at first.\"This isn't programming in the traditional sense; the method of interacting with these bots is through language,\" Morgan says. \"Asking the program to extract data and then asking it to check if it is sure with normal sentences feels closer to how I train my children to get correct answers than how I usually train computers. It's such a different way to ask a computer to do things. It really changes how you think about what your computer can do.\"Importantly, the technique doesn't require a lot of effort or deep knowledge, according to Polak.\"Previously, people had to write hundreds of lines of code to do something like this, and the results often weren't great,\" Polak says. \"Now we have this huge improvement in capabilities with tools like ChatGPT.\"Morgan is quick to note that integrating AI into research does not replace graduate students and scientists. Instead, these tools could allow researchers to pursue projects they previously didn't have the time, money or people-power to undertake.\"I think these tools will change the way we do research, analogously to how Google changed the way we did research,\" Morgan says. \"Today we typically explore a field by using Google and other search tools to help us find papers and related resources, and then we read those papers and resources to extract information and data. Now you can go to one of these large language models to collect information around a topic and, using techniques like those we've been developing, build a database for review within hours.\" More information:Maciej P.

  "question_squad": " What is the new process based on?",
  "answer_squad": " pressurized water extraction",
  "text": "What doesn't smell good is hard to recycle. This simple rule also applies to the growing volume of plastic waste worldwide. One way to recycle it in an environmentally compatible and climate-friendly manner as high-quality post-consumer recyclates is through improved sorting and reprocessing. Until now, the reduced material quality has considerably limited the reuse of plastic recyclates, and this is mainly due to their odor.          Scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Structural Durability and System Reliability LBF have now developed a new environmentally friendly process on a laboratory scale to remove odors from plastic packaging.The new process is based on pressurized water extraction. It removes the tracer fragrance limonene from commercial HDPE packaging and does not require organic solvents. This reduces costs and protects the environment. In this way, the material quality of processed plastic waste can be significantly increased within one hour.The in-process analysis is based on infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry that provide the research team with data on the chemical composition of the samples as a function of different extraction conditions. The analytical data show that significantly less limonene is present in the samples after extraction. Furthermore, in addition to the fragrance, other impurities and short-chain HDPE are removed from the samples that were originally contained in the packaging.Based on these analyses, the Darmstadt experts determined the optimal process parameters for pressurized water extraction of fragrances from HDPE packaging. \"The project results demonstrate the benefits of a systemic approach to solving current plastics technology issues with great social relevance,\" emphasizes Dr. Guru Geertz, who oversees the project at Fraunhofer LBF.Material analysis with machine learning methods optimizes extraction processTo develop the process, detailed insights into the chemical kinetics of the extraction process were necessary, which were made possible by a novel approach for in-process analytics: Evaluating the data with the aid of machine learning methods was the key to optimize the extraction parameters in terms of the desired economical process control. At the current stage of development, an application scenario for the new process is emerging for the improved treatment of plastic waste.\"The extraction process we have developed shows a way to reprocessed single-use plastics with an increased range of applications, and this serves to protect the environment,\" says Dr. Geertz. Due to the underlying concept, the process is equally suitable for industrialized, emerging, and developing countries, so that all market participants who bring plastic products into the trade can potentially benefit from it.

  "text": "Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28 \u201334 times that of carbon dioxide on a centennial time scale. Microbial CH4 oxidation acts as a biofilter, preventing more than 90% of CH4 from entering the atmosphere.          Traditionally, aerobic CH4-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) are O2-dependent to grow on CH4 as their sole carbon and energy source. Increasing studies have shown that MOB are present and even active in anoxic environments, without using O2 as an electron acceptor by them, but their survival strategy and ecological contribution are still mysterious.Researchers led by Dr. Li Biao from Prof. Wu Qinglong's team at the Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NIGLAS), together with their collaborators, have investigated the survival strategies of MOB under anoxic conditions. Their results were published in Water Research.After two years of enrichment, the researchers obtained an enriched consortium dominated by \u03b3-MOB, Methylomonas and several other heterotrophic bacteria, but without anaerobic methanotrophs.They found that the MOB consortium can couple CH4 oxidation and Fe(III) reduction under anoxia using electron shuttles such as riboflavin. Within the MOB consortium, MOB converted CH4 to low molecular weight organics such as acetate for the consortium bacteria as a carbon source, while the latter secreted riboflavin to facilitate extracellular electron transfer.\"A metabolic flexibility was observed in this conventionally considered O2-dependent microbe, MOB. Given that iron is the fourth most abundant element on Earth and generally abundant in lacustrine sediments, the use of iron oxides as electron acceptors may be a critical lifestyle for MOB and an important CH4 sink on early Earth, where anoxic conditions are ubiquitous,\" said Dr. Li.In the in situ anoxic sediments, several types of microbes associated with the consortium, including Methylomonas, were transcriptionally active. In addition, Fe(III) reduction coupled with CH4 oxidation mediated by the MOB consortium reduced 40.3% of the CH4 emissions in the iron-rich sediments.\"There are many iron-rich areas in South China, MOB in these iron-rich areas may play a crucial role in mitigating CH4 emission even under anoxia there. Our study reveals how MOBs survive under anoxia and expands the knowledge of this previously overlooked CH4 sink in iron-rich sediments,\" said Dr. Li.

  "text": "A team of materials scientists from NASA working with a colleague from The Ohio State University and another from HX5 LLC has developed a 3D printing process that produces an alloy that is much more resistant to stress than others now in use. Their study is reported in Nature.          As scientists develop new ways to produce energy and explore space, a need has arisen for materials that can survive under extreme conditions\u2014those used to make rocket nozzles, for example. To meet that need, materials scientists have been creating alloys that are ever more resistant to heat and other stressful elements. In this new effort, the research team took a big step forward by developing a 3D process to create an alloy that is much more resilient than anything created thus far.Prior research has shown that adding ceramic to metal alloys gives them more resilience. Unfortunately, adding ceramic has proven to be problematic due to the difference in characteristics of metals and ceramics\u2014the lighter ceramic bits tend to float to the top when added to molten metal. To overcome that problem, the researchers turned to 3D printing.They used an \"ink\" made of a mixture of cobalt, nickel and chrome particles and programmed the printer to add a dusting of yttrium oxide powder to each layer of ink. As the printing progresses, a layer of the metal alloy is printed onto a surface, followed by a fine layer of yttrium oxide particles, which are then heated with a laser, forcing the particles into the metal alloy. The result is a layer of metal alloy infused with tiny pieces of ceramic material. As the process continues, an object is created\u2014a nozzle, for example. The researchers call the new alloy GRX-810.The team tested their new material using the \"creep test,\" whereby a test material is subjected to high temperatures while also carrying a heavy load to provide stress. The longer it lasts, the more resistant the material. Current top materials typically last approximately 10 hours\u2014 GRX-810 lasted for 6,500 hours. More information:Timothy M.

  "answer_race": " Artificial intelligence is used to design new proteins.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the MIT professor who is also a member of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab?",
  "answer_squad": " Markus Buehler",
  "text": "MIT researchers are using artificial intelligence to design new proteins that go beyond those found in nature.          They have developed machine-learning algorithms that can generate proteins with specific structural features, which could be used to make materials that have certain mechanical properties, like stiffness or elasticity. Such biologically inspired materials could potentially replace materials made from petroleum or ceramics, but with a much smaller carbon footprint.The researchers from MIT, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and Tufts University employed a generative model, which is the same type of machine-learning model architecture used in AI systems like DALL-E 2. But instead of using it to generate realistic images from natural language prompts, like DALL-E 2 does, they adapted the model architecture so it could predict amino acid sequences of proteins that achieve specific structural objectives.In a paper to be published in Chem, the researchers demonstrate how these models can generate realistic, yet novel, proteins. The models, which learn biochemical relationships that control how proteins form, can produce new proteins that could enable unique applications, says senior author Markus Buehler, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering and professor of civil and environmental engineering and of mechanical engineering.For instance, this tool could be used to develop protein-inspired food coatings, which could keep produce fresh longer while being safe for humans to eat. And the models can generate millions of proteins in a few days, quickly giving scientists a portfolio of new ideas to explore, he adds.\"When you think about designing proteins nature has not discovered yet, it is such a huge design space that you can't just sort it out with a pencil and paper. You have to figure out the language of life, the way amino acids are encoded by DNA and then come together to form protein structures. Before we had deep learning, we really couldn't do this,\" says Buehler, who is also a member of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.Joining Buehler on the paper are lead author Bo Ni, a postdoc in Buehler's Laboratory for Atomistic and Molecular Mechanics; and David Kaplan, the Stern Family Professor of Engineering and professor of bioengineering at Tufts.      Adapting new tools for the taskProteins are formed by chains of amino acids, folded together in 3D patterns. The sequence of amino acids determines the mechanical properties of the protein. While scientists have identified thousands of proteins created through evolution, they estimate that an enormous number of amino acid sequences remain undiscovered.To streamline protein discovery, researchers have recently developed deep learning models that can predict the 3D structure of a protein for a set of amino acid sequences. But the inverse problem\u2014predicting a sequence of amino acid structures that meet design targets\u2014has proven even more challenging.A new advent in machine learning enabled Buehler and his colleagues to tackle this thorny challenge: attention-based diffusion models.Attention-based models can learn very long-range relationships, which is key to developing proteins because one mutation in a long amino acid sequence can make or break the entire design, Buehler says. A diffusion model learns to generate new data through a process that involves adding noise to training data, then learning to recover the data by removing the noise. They are often more effective than other models at generating high-quality, realistic data that can be conditioned to meet a set of target objectives to meet a design demand.The researchers used this architecture to build two machine-learning models that can predict a variety of new amino acid sequences which form proteins that meet structural design targets.\"In the biomedical industry, you might not want a protein that is completely unknown because then you don't know its properties. But in some applications, you might want a brand-new protein that is similar to one found in nature, but does something different. We can generate a spectrum with these models, which we control by tuning certain knobs,\" Buehler says.Common folding patterns of amino acids, known as secondary structures, produce different mechanical properties. For instance, proteins with alpha helix structures yield stretchy materials while those with beta sheet structures yield rigid materials. Combining alpha helices and beta sheets can create materials that are stretchy and strong, like silks.The researchers developed two models, one that operates on overall structural properties of the protein and one that operates at the amino acid level. Both models work by combining these amino acid structures to generate proteins. For the model that operates on the overall structural properties, a user inputs a desired percentage of different structures (40% alpha-helix and 60% beta sheet, for instance). Then the model generates sequences that meet those targets. For the second model, the scientist also specifies the order of amino acid structures, which gives much finer-grained control.The models are connected to an algorithm that predicts protein folding, which the researchers use to determine the protein's 3D structure. Then they calculate its resulting properties and check those against the design specifications.Realistic yet novel designsThey tested their models by comparing the new proteins to known proteins that have similar structural properties. Many had some overlap with existing amino acid sequences, about 50% to 60% in most cases, but also some entirely new sequences. The level of similarity suggests that many of the generated proteins are synthesizable, Buehler adds.To ensure the predicted proteins are reasonable, the researchers tried to trick the models by inputting physically impossible design targets. They were impressed to see that, instead of producing improbable proteins, the models generated the closest synthesizable solution.\"The learning algorithm can pick up the hidden relationships in nature. This gives us confidence to say that whatever comes out of our model is very likely to be realistic,\" Ni says.Next, the researchers plan to experimentally validate some of the new protein designs by making them in a lab. They also want to continue augmenting and refining the models so they can develop amino acid sequences that meet more criteria, such as biological functions.\"For the applications we are interested in, like sustainability, medicine, food, health, and materials design, we are going to need to go beyond what nature has done. Here is a new design tool that we can use to create potential solutions that might help us solve some of the really pressing societal issues we are facing,\" Buehler says. More information:Markus J.

  "text": "There are high expectations that quantum computers may deliver revolutionary new possibilities for simulating chemical processes. This could have a major impact on everything from the development of new pharmaceuticals to new materials. Researchers at Chalmers University have now, for the first time in Sweden, used a quantum computer to undertake calculations within a real-life case in chemistry.          \"Quantum computers could in theory be used to handle cases where electrons and atomic nuclei move in more complicated ways. If we can learn to utilize their full potential, we should be able to advance the boundaries of what is possible to calculate and understand,\" says Martin Rahm, Associate Professor in Theoretical Chemistry at the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, who has led the study.Within the field of quantum chemistry, the laws of quantum mechanics are used to understand which chemical reactions are possible, which structures and materials can be developed, and what characteristics they have. Such studies are normally undertaken with the help of super computers, built with conventional logical circuits. There is however a limit for which calculations conventional computers can handle. Because the laws of quantum mechanics describe the behavior of nature on a subatomic level, many researchers believe that a quantum computer should be better equipped to perform molecular calculations than a conventional computer.\"Most things in this world are inherently chemical. For example, our energy carriers, within biology as well as in old or new cars, are made up of electrons and atomic nuclei arranged in different ways in molecules and materials. Some of the problems we solve in the field of quantum chemistry are to calculate which of these arrangements are more likely or advantageous, along with their characteristics,\" says Martin Rahm.A new method minimizes errors in the quantum chemical calculationsThere is still a way to go before quantum computers can achieve what the researchers are aiming for. This field of research is still young and the small model calculations that are run are complicated by noise from the quantum computer's surroundings. However, Martin Rahm and his colleagues have now found a method that they see as an important step forward. The method is called Reference-State Error Mitigation (REM) and works by correcting for the errors that occur due to noise by utilizing the calculations from both a quantum computer and a conventional computer.\"The study is a proof-of-concept that our method can improve the quality of quantum-chemical calculations. It is a useful tool that we will use to improve our calculations on quantum computers moving forward,\" says Martin Rahm. The article, \"Reference-State Error Mitigation: A Strategy for High Accuracy Quantum Computation of Chemistry,\" is published in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation.The principle behind the method is to first consider a reference state by describing and solving the same problem on both a conventional and a quantum computer. This reference state represents a simpler description of a molecule than the original problem intended to be solved by the quantum computer. A conventional computer can solve this simpler version of the problem quickly. By comparing the results from both computers, an exact estimate can be made for the amount of error caused by noise. The difference between the two computers' solutions for the reference problem can then be used to correct the solution for the original, more complex, problem when it is run on the quantum processor.By combining this new method with data from Chalmers' quantum computer S\u00e4rimner the researchers have succeeded in calculating the intrinsic energy of small example molecules such as hydrogen and lithium hydride. Equivalent calculations can be carried out more quickly on a conventional computer, but the new method represents an important development and is the first demonstration of a quantum chemical calculation on a quantum computer in Sweden.\"We see good possibilities for further development of the method to allow calculations of larger and more complex molecules, when the next generation of quantum computers are ready,\" says Martin Rahm.      Quantum computer built at ChalmersThe research has been conducted in close collaboration with colleagues at the Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience. They have built the quantum computers that are used in the study, and helped perform the sensitive measurements that are needed for the chemical calculations.\"It is only by using real quantum algorithms that we can understand how our hardware really works and how we can improve it. Chemical calculations are one of the first areas where we believe that quantum computers will be useful, so our collaboration with Martin Rahm's group is especially valuable,\" says Jonas Bylander, Associate Professor in Quantum Technology at the Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience.

  "text": "The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into C2+ products such as ethylene is a promising path toward the carbon neutral goal, but it remains a big challenge due to the high activation barrier for CO2 and similar reduction potentials of many possible multi-electron transfer products.          In a study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the research group led by Prof. Cao Rong and Prof. Huang Yuanbiao from Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter of the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported a tandem photocatalysis strategy to support conversion of CO2 to ethylene.The researchers developed this tandem photocatalysis strategy by the construction of the synergistic dual sites in rhenium-(I) bipyridine fac-[ReI(bpy)(CO)3Cl] (Re-bpy) and copper-porphyrinic triazine framework (PTF(Cu)). With these two catalysts, they produced a large amount of ethylene at a rate of 73.2 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1 under visible light irradiation. Ethylene cannot be obtained from CO2 by the use of either component of the Re-bpy or PTF(Cu). Only monocarbon product CO is produced under similar conditions with a single catalyst.In the tandem photocatalytic system, the researchers found that the CO generated at the Re-bpy sites was adsorbed by the nearby Cu single sites in PTF(Cu), and this was followed by a synergistic C-C coupling process which ultimately produces ethylene.Based on the analysis of the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the researchers photoreduced CO2 to Re-bpy-CO* over the Re-bpy, from which some of the CO can be desorbed and moved to the nearby PTF(Cu) where it is adsorbed by the single-atomic Cu site to form PTF(Cu)-CO*.Additionally, the C-C coupling occurred in the synergy of the intermediates PTF(Cu)-CO* and Re-bpy-CO* to form Re-*CO-CO*-Cu, which was finally reduced and released as ethylene with multistep proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) processes. DFT calculations demonstrated that the coupling process between PTF(Cu)-*CO and Re-bpy-*CO to form the key intermediate Re-bpy-*CO-*CO-PTF(Cu) is vital to the C2H4 production.This study provides a new way for the design of efficient photocatalysts for photocoversion of CO2 to C2 products via a tandem process driven by visible-light under mild conditions.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the isotope that shows great promise for treating cancer?",
  "answer_squad": " Ac-225",
  "text": "Thanks to a recent upgrade to the medical isotope facilities at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory, actinium-225 (Ac-225), an isotope that shows great promise for treating cancer, can now be produced, purified, and shipped ready for use directly from the Lab. The first shipment left Brookhaven in mid-March.          \"This upgrade will streamline the overall production and distribution of Ac-225 to research centers by eliminating the need to ship material off site for final processing,\" said Cathy Cutler, Director of Medical Isotope Research & Production (MIRP) at Brookhaven Lab.The promise of Ac-225 stems from the way this radioactive isotope decays. It emits alpha particles, which can deliver a lethal punch to cancerous cells over a short distance. Attaching Ac-225 to molecules that target tumors could potentially kill cancer cells without harming surrounding tissue. Ac-225 can also be used to generate bismuth-213, another alpha-emitter.Since 2014, MIRP scientists have been part of the DOE Isotope Program \"Tri-Lab\" effort to produce Ac-225 (and Ac-225/Bi-213 generators) so doctors can run clinical trials to test its efficacy. Using powerful proton accelerators, scientists at Brookhaven and Los Alamos National Laboratory irradiate targets made of thorium-232. The proton bombardment transforms some of the thorium atoms into actinium-225. Both Brookhaven and Los Alamos have been shipping their irradiated targets to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which has the facilities to extract and purify the isotope.\"Dmitri Medvedev of MIRP played a huge role in making this happen, both developing the targets we use at the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer (BLIP) and collaborating on the way we process alpha emitters with the Tri-Lab team,\" Cutler said.This Tri-Lab effort established reliable, routine Ac-225 production, and demonstrated that the process is scalable. But the availability of \"hot-cell\" space\u2014the specialized labs and equipment needed for processing radioactive materials\u2014limited how much Ac-225 could be made.                This long-exposure image makes it possible to see the glow of actinium-225, an isotope that shows great promise for treating cancer. Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory             In 2018, the Brookhaven team and DOE worked out a solution. With an $8.5 million investment from the DOE Science Laboratories Infrastructure program, they began refurbishing an old metallurgical laboratory that had been dormant at Brookhaven since the 1990s. The renovation, led by Brian McCaffrey of Brookhaven Lab's Facilities & Operations Directorate, included retrofitting the obsolete hot cell facility and labs to create a new All-Purpose (AP) Hot Cell facility to enhance Brookhaven's Isotope Program processing capabilities.      \"ORNL aided us in translating the process here. We also had to get special licensing and install new radiation-monitoring equipment,\" Cutler said.Brookhaven's new AP hot cells, completed in March, have doubled the number of Ac-225 processing sites for DOE's Isotope Program. This expanded processing capacity provides redundancy so Brookhaven and ORNL can serve as backups for each other.There are clear benefits in having both target irradiation and hot cells for processing at one laboratory. It establishes a more efficient path for producing larger Ac-225 batch sizes by removing the logistical challenges inherent in involving multiple labs and transporting targets.\"Now we can irradiate the targets and process them right here at Brookhaven so that Ac-225 can be shipped directly to research centers,\" Cutler said.The hope is that this accelerator-produced supply of Ac-225 will advance the development of promising cancer treatments\u2014and ultimately support the market demands of therapies that get approved.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the most stable isotope of berkelium?",
  "answer_squad": " Bk-249",
  "text": "Researchers need a better way to extract individual heavy metal elements, called actinides, to obtain a purer product. In 2018, researchers discovered that the actinide berkelium, when oxidized, does not form negatively charged ions in solutions of high nitric acid, as other actinides do. This meant an anion exchange column could separate berkelium by absorbing other actinides with negatively charged ions.          This system moves berkelium dissolved in highly concentrated nitric acid through a series of columns. The top column blocks negatively charged impurities. The lower column collects berkelium while positively charged impurities pass through. Nitric acid then strips purified berkelium from the lower column. This produced the world's purest Bk-249 to date.The extraction of individual actinides is essential for improving nuclear fuel recycling and nuclear waste management. This new method is much faster than the previous approach, taking just eight days compared to eight weeks. It is also easier, cleaner, and yields purer product. This could be applied toward the production of heavy actinides.If berkelium's state allows it to chemically bond, it can be directly extracted from a mixture of other actinides. This is useful when researchers want only berkelium from a complex solution. In addition, this method could be applied to other separations\u2014for example, rare einsteinium and fermium.By replacing the original multi-drying-down and multi-column runs with a single dual column run, the new method for purifying berkelium results in historically high radiochemical purity of the finished product\u201497.25 percent purity, compared to 93.9 percent for the previous method. The new process also is significantly quicker and simpler, leaving less room for error. Instead of needing sensitive pH adjustments, temperature control and drop counts, the new method achieves the separation of metal ions by easy operations at room temperature.The first member of the second half of the actinide series, berkelium can be used to learn more about the behavior of heavier elements, whose studies are limited by very short half-lives, very high radioactivity, and very short supply. Currently, berkelium's primary use is in heavy element research.For example, its most stable isotope, Bk-249, played a significant role in the creation of superheavy element 117, tennessine. A byproduct of californium-252 production at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Bk-249 was irradiated in a calcium-48 beam by an international research collaboration to create a half-dozen atoms of the element tennessine.The research is published in the Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry.

  "text": "Lignin depolymerization is playing a pivotal role in transforming the second most abundant type of biopolymer in nature into many valuable chemicals/fuels. This route could directly replace their petrol-based equivalents and therefore presents a great pathway to fight climate change and contribute to future sustainability.          Interpretation of the reaction pathways helps with gaining an insightful mechanic view in understanding the depolymerization chemistry and paving new paths for lignin valorization at the industrial scale. However, such interpretation heavily relies on the state-of-art analytical capability, since in the process there are many oligomeric products formed but not well-characterized due to the limited instrumental analysis choices.A team of scientists, therefore, summarized the considerable progress in the formation and identification of lignin oligomeric products in recent years. Both the existing and expected potential valorization routes are discussed, and technical hurdles and recommendations are provided in an attempt to catalyze the development of new discoveries and enabling technologies. The work is published in Industrial Chemistry & Materials.\"Analyzing the oligomeric products from lignin polymerization is playing important role in transforming the renewable lignin polymer to many valuable chemicals and fuels,\" said Seema Singh, a director of biomass deconstruction division at Joint Bioenergy Institute.\"In this review, we systematically discussed the recent development of identification of the oligomeric products from various lignin depolymerization, thus revealing the mechanical insight of the processes and to provide helpful guidance for understanding the formation of such oligomers chemically. We also provided our perspectives on the existing and expected potential valorization routes for the oligomers as well as discussed the remaining challenges to this field.\"Common targeted products from lignin depolymerization are monomeric phenols, aromatics, cycloalkanes, and dicarboxylic acids. The large scale of one such process can be exemplified by the industrial production of vanillin through oxidative catalytic depolymerization.The relatively low cost of the substrate and the ease of operation counteract the fact that the yield of vanillin is often not high, which overall still makes this process economically viable. The same logic, however, may not be well applied to other lignin-valorization routes, such as reductive catalytic depolymerization, which is often a pre-treatment of lignin (via hydrogenolysis) if the final products are fuel-ranged cycloalkanes.      A similar dilemma also exists in the thermochemical treatment of lignin. Regardless of the chemical treatments, oligomeric fractions from any lignin depolymerization are inevitably formed as the side products, and in many cases, can be the major products as well. The inherent causes, although not very clear so far, have been extensively discussed in many studies.One of the commonly agreed viewpoints is the unavoidable participation of the crosslinking/repolymerization reactions during the proceeding of various lignin depolymerizations. Major efforts, therefore, had been made to mitigate the repolymerization processes.\"The depolymerization of lignin provides access to a new dimension of the utilization of lignin-based materials,\" said Blake Simmons, director of Biological System and Engineering Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, \"In order to improve processes of bioenergy/bioproducts, more research efforts should emphasize on the reactivity and selectivity of depolymerized lignin oligomers. There is huge room to control the structure, molecular weight, branching, and functional complexity to adapt lignin to various valorization processes.\"\"So far, we don't know if repolymerization is the only explanation for the formation of the oligomeric products or not, but there have been enough publications, especially in recent years, reporting that the formation could be sometimes also due to other reasons depends on the condition,\" said Yinglei Han, a postdoctoral researcher at Joint Bioenergy Institute and Sandia National Laboratories.\"We therefore highly motivated to summarize all the options and present an overview on elucidating the formation causes. Presently, three routes have been identified and established to reveal the formation of the oligomeric products during various depolymerization.\"\"One of the biggest technical hurdles in achieving this potential is the difficulty in identifying all depolymerization products,\" said Han, \"The oligomers are indispensable pieces if one wants to gain an insightful mechanistic view of the process or to valorize them. Such difficulty could mainly be attributed to the structural heterogeneity of lignin which could significantly diversify the derived oligomeric products compared to the depolymerization of those petroleum-based polymers (e.g., polyethylene, polystyrene).\"The state-of-the-art methods for characterizing these oligomeric products are Two-dimensional Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Elite) and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, combined with other less informative instrumental analyses, such as UV/vis, UV-florescence, pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrum, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.All these techniques combined, however, are still inadequate for distinguishing and then quantifying each oligomer. More efforts are needed in this aspect in the future, which is pivotal in utilizing these oligomeric products in many other applications.\"The reported pathways for the valorization of such oligomeric products can be generally categorized into three, 1) further depolymerization for more phenolic monomers, 2) modification of lignin oligomers into value-added materials, and 3) decomposition to short-chain dicarboxylic acids or even hydrogen gas,\" Han said, \"Several new ideas have recently been proposed and tested for utilizing lignin oligomers, such as transformation to photocatalyst, antioxidant, or use as a battery binder.\"\"In this review, our main goal is to provide readers with timely and accurate latest research progress on oligomeric product formation during depolymerization, which is a much-needed topic in the lignin valorization field,\" Singh said.

  "text": "A pair of chemists at Cornell University has extended the scope of carbonyl olefination reactions by developing a new electrophotocatalytic process. In their paper published in the journal Science Advances, Keri Steiniger and Tristan Lambert describe their new process and the situations in which it might be used.          Olefins (a class of unsaturated, open-chain hydrocarbons) are often used as the basis for organic synthesis in the manufacture of plastics, the processing of petrochemicals and preparation of many types of rubbers\u2014but they have a drawback: They generally involve use of a strong base, which tends to limit tolerance of functional groups during reactions.In this new effort, the researchers used electrophotocatalysis to extend the scope of such reactions. In their process, electrophotocatalytic and electrochemical oxidations are paired to create intermediates in a way that can be controlled. It also allows alkenes, which serve as olefination agents, to react with both ketones and aldehydes. As the reaction occurs, two main byproducts are released\u2014hydrogen and nitrogen gases. They acknowledge that the process looks a bit unorthodox when viewed from a distance, but insist that in practice, it works quite well.In the new process, a diazo compound is generated electrochemically from an organic carbonyl (any of a functional group made up of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom) along with a hydrazine (a volatile alkaline liquid). Due to cycloaddition, a cyclic diazene is produced along with the desired alkene.As nitrogen is lost, a distonic radical cation reduction leaves the target olefin. The researchers note that the reaction allows for controlling the rate at which the electrons are transferred, which in turn allows for the conversion to an olefin, as opposed to a cyclopropane. They also note that the process can be used with a broad range of unactivated alkenes.In addition to broadening the scope of carbonyl olefination reactions, the new process also allows for creating olefins without production of wastes typically associated with their syntheses. The research team suggests it could also be used as an alternative to Witting olefination, allowing the creation of a host of new products, including some in the pharmaceutical industry.

  "text": "A team of UCR electrical engineers and material scientists demonstrated a research breakthrough that may result in wide-ranging advancements in electrical, optical, and computer technologies.          The Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering research group, led by distinguished professor Alexander Balandin, has shown in the laboratory the unique and practical function of newly created materials, which they called quantum composites.These composites consist of small crystals of called \"charge density wave quantum materials\" incorporated within a polymer (large molecules with repeating structures) matrix. Upon heating or light exposure, charge density wave material undergoes a phase transition that leads to an unusual electrical response of the composites.Compared to other materials that reveal quantum phenomena, the quantum composites created by Balandin's group exhibited functionality at a much wider range of temperatures and had a greatly increased ability to store electricity, giving them an excellent potential for utility.The University of California, Riverside, researchers describe the unique properties in a paper titled \"Quantum Composites with Charge-Density-Wave Fillers\" published in the journal Advanced Materials. The lead authors of the paper are Zahra Barani and Tekwam Geremew, UCR graduate students with the college's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, who synthesized and tested the composites. Another UCR graduate student Maedeh Taheri is a co-author who helped with electrical measurements. Balandin and Fariborz Kargar, an assistant adjunct professor and project scientist, are the corresponding authors.The term quantum refers to materials and devices where electrons behave more like waves than particles. The wave nature of electrons can give materials unusual properties that are used in a new generation of computer, electronic and optic technologies.Materials that reveal quantum phenomena are sought for building quantum computers that go beyond the limitations of most computing that is now based on chips that use binary bits for computations. Such materials are also sought for super-sensitive sensors used for various electronic and optic applications.But the materials with quantum phenomena have major drawbacks, Balandin said.      \"The problem with these materials is that the quantum phenomena are fragile and typically observed only at extremely low temperatures,\" he said. \"The defects and impurities destroy the electron wave function.\"Remarkably, the charge density wave material in the quantum composites created by Balandin's lab exhibited functionality as high as 50\u00baC above room temperature. This transition temperature is close to the temperature of the operation of computers and other electronic gadgets, which heat up when they operate. This temperature tolerance opens a possibility for a wide range of applications of quantum composites in electronics and energy storage.The researchers also found that quantum composites have an unusually high dielectric constant\u2014a metric that characterizes the material's ability to store electricity. The dielectric constant of the electrically insulating composites increased by more than two orders of magnitude, which allows for smaller and more powerful capacitors used for energy storage.\"Energy storage capacitors can be found in battery-powered applications,\" Balandin said. \"Capacitors can be used to deliver peak power and provide energy for computer memory during an unexpected shut-off. Capacitors can charge and discharge faster compared to batteries. In order to broaden the use of capacitors for energy storage, one needs to increase the energy per volume. Our quantum composite material may help to achieve this goal.\"Another possible application for quantum composites is reflective coating. The change in the dielectric constant induced by heating, light exposure, or application of an electrical field can be used to change the light reflection from the glasses and windows coated with such composites.\"We hope that our ability to preserve the quantum condensate phases in the charge-density-wave materials even inside disordered composites and even above room temperature can become a game changer for many applications. It is a conceptually different approach for tuning the properties of composites that we use in everyday life,\" Balandin added.

Therefore, there is a need to search for new materials exhibiting high conductivities and stability at low temperatures (100\u00b0C\u2013300\u00b0C). While some bismuth(Bi)-containing materials exhibit high oxide-ion conductivities through the conventional vacancy diffusion mechanism, they are not very stable under reduced atmospheres. As an alternative, the interstitialcy migration mechanism, involving the knock-on motion of interstitial and lattice oxide ions, has attracted much attention. However, they are rarely observed in Bi-containing materials.A team of researchers from Japan led by Prof. Masatomo Yashima of Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) put their heads together to find a solution to these problems. In their recent breakthrough published in Advanced Functional Materials, the team reported a new Bi-containing compound, LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl, where the oxide ions migrate via the interstitialcy mechanism. The team demonstrated that LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl exhibits both high stability and a high oxide-ion conductivity that is superior to those of even the best oxide-ion conductors at low temperatures (below 201\u00b0C).When asked how the team was able to discover LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl, Prof. Yashima explains, \"Most known Bi-containing materials exhibit high oxide-ion conductivities via the conventional vacancy diffusion mechanism. The alternative mechanism, interstitialcy diffusion, is rare in these materials. Thus, we specifically searched for Bi-containing materials with interstitial oxygen site that could enable the interstitialcy diffusion.\"The interstitial oxygen site refers to the empty space within a crystal structure the oxide ions partially occupy. Prof. Yashima's group selected a Bi-containing Sill\u00e9n oxychloride, LaBi2O4Cl, with a triple fluorite-like layer to ensure the presence of such interstitial oxygen sites. They then partially substituted the Bi3+ cation with a high valence dopant, tellurium (Te) cation Te4+, in the Sill\u00e9n phase LaBi2O4Cl to increase the amount of interstitial oxygen atoms (x/2) in LaBi2\u2013xTexO4+x/2Cl. The chemical composition, LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl (x = 0.1 in LaBi1\u2013xTexO4+x/2Cl), was then chosen for detailed experimental and computational studies since the bulk conductivity of LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl was the highest among those of all the other compositions, i.e., LaBi2\u2013xTexO4+x/2Cl (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.2).      The team found that LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl exhibits high chemical and electrical stability at 400\u00b0C in a wide oxygen partial pressure region between 10\u221225 to 0.2 atm, as well as a high chemical stability in CO2, wet H2 in N2, and air with natural humidity. Further, LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl demonstrated a high oxide-ion conductivity of 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 S cm\u22121 at 702\u00b0C. The bulk conductivity of the material was significantly higher than those of the best oxide-ion conductors such as Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 at temperatures between 96\u00b0C\u2013201\u00b0C.To elucidate the mechanism underlying the high oxide-ion conduction, the team performed neutron-diffraction experiments, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and DFT calculations. The results indicated that the extremely high oxide-ion conduction is explained by an interstitialcy migration of oxide ions through the lattice and interstitial sites, which is a rare occurrence in Bi-containing materials.The discovery of the high oxide ionic conductivity along with high chemical and electrical stability of LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl, and the unique mechanism underlying the high conductivity will open door to further research on Bi-containing compounds and Sill\u00e9n phases, and eventually to high-performance SOFC electrolytes at low temperatures.\"There were studies on the photocatalysis and luminescence of Sill\u00e9n phases in the research literature. In our study, we have now demonstrated that Sill\u00e9n Bi-containing oxychlorides can also act as promising electrolytes for SOFCs and could contribute to the fuel cell revolution,\" concludes Prof. Yashima.

  "text": "Plants that glow under ultraviolet (UV) light aren't just inventions of science fiction TV and movies. Roots of a traditional medicine plant called the orange climber, or Toddalia asiatica, can fluoresce an ethereal blue hue. And now, researchers have identified two coumarin molecules that could be responsible. These natural coumarins have unique fluorescent properties, and one of the compounds could someday be used for medical imaging. Their study is published in ACS Central Science.       Fluorescent substances take in UV light that is directed on them and release vibrantly colored visible light. And some glow even more brightly when they are close together, a phenomenon seen in compounds called aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). They are key components in some optical devices, cellular imaging techniques and environmental sensors. However, these molecules are usually made in a lab, and many are toxic. Some plants already have this ability, so, Ben Zhong Tang, Zheng Zhao, Xiao-Dong Luo and colleagues turned to nature to find naturally occurring and safer AIEgens.The researchers dried orange climber roots, crushed them into a powder, and then isolated and identified coumarin compounds with aggregation-induced emission properties: 5-methoxyseselin (5-MOS) and 6-methoxyseselin (6-MOS). When dissolved in an organic solvent, 5-MOS exhibited a blue-green glow and 6-MOS had a slightly dimmer blue glow. In addition, both AIEgens had low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility.Then in a final series of experiments, the team found that mitochondria could be clearly identified in live cells stained with 5-MOS without any additional processing, making cell imaging easier and faster than with most current methods. The newly reported compound is a natural, plant-derived option that could advance bioimaging, the researchers say.

  "answer_squad": " Nafion",
  "text": "In a project commissioned by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), researchers at Nagoya University in Japan have developed poly(styrenesulfonic acid)-based PEMs with a high density of sulfonic acid groups.          One of the key components of environmentally friendly polymer electrolyte fuel cells is a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM). It generates electrical energy through a reaction between hydrogen and oxygen gases. Examples of practical fuel cells include fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and fuel cell combined heat and power (CHP) systems.The best-known PEM is a membrane based on a perfluorosulfonic acid polymer, such as Nafion, which was developed by DuPont in the 1960s. It has a good proton conductivity of 0.1 S/cm at 70-90 \u00b0C under humidified conditions. Under these conditions, protons can be released from sulfonic acid groups.Proton conduction in such membranes typically depends on the proton transport mechanism between protons, sulfonic acid groups, and water molecules. Typically, the higher the density of the sulfonic acid groups in the membrane, the higher the density of protons that can be released from the sulfonic acid groups; therefore, the higher density of the sulfonic acid groups usually results in higher proton conductivities.However, using a conventional synthesis process, it is difficult to synthesize PEMs with a high density of sulfonic acid groups. For instance, to increase the density of sulfonic acid groups in a poly(styrenesulfonic acid)-based PEM, the sulfonation reaction must be carried out over long hours or under severe conditions. It usually uses highly oxidizing substances, such as fuming sulfuric acid and chlorosulfonic acid.Unfortunately, this leads to undesirable side reactions, such as cleavage of the backbone chains of the polymer. Therefore, to avoid unwanted side reactions during polymer synthesis, commercially available PEMs are usually synthesized to have a low density of sulfonic acid groups. For commercially available Nafion or poly(styrenesulfonic acid)-based PEMs such as Selemion by AGC, the ion exchange capacity (IEC), an index of the density of acid groups, is typically less than 1.0 meq/g.In the paper, Atsushi Noro and colleagues at the Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University and from the Institutes of Innovation for Future Society also Nagoya University, have developed poly(styrenesulfonic acid)-based PEM with an ultrahigh density of sulfonic acid groups.The IEC of the PEM was 5.0 meq/g. This is five times higher than the IEC of typical commercially available PEMs such as Nafion or Selemion. Its proton conductivity at 80\u00b0C under 90%RH (a common operating condition for polymer electrolyte fuel cells) was 0.93 S/cm. This is six times higher than the conductivity of Nafion (0.15 S/cm) or Selemion (0.091 S/cm) under the same measurement conditions.Future fuel cells must be operated under more severe operating conditions such as higher temperatures and lower humidities. This study will contribute to the synthesis and development of next-generation higher-performance PEMs exhibiting a good conductivity of 0.1 S/cm or higher under such severe conditions. The study will also contribute to the goal of reaching a net-zero carbon society.

  "text": "Among all greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide is the highest contributor to global warming. If we do not take action by 2100, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the average temperature of our world will increase by about 34 degrees Fahrenheit. Finding effective ways to capture and store CO2 has been a challenge for researchers and industries focused on combating global warming, and Amir Barati Farimani has been working to change that.          \"Machine learning models bear the promise for discovering new chemical compounds or materials to fight against global warming,\" explains Barati Farimani, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. \"Machine learning models can achieve accurate and efficient virtual screening of CO2 storage candidates and may even generate preferable compounds that never existed before.\"Barati Farimani has made a breakthrough using machine learning to identify ionic liquid molecules. Ionic liquids (ILs) are families of molten salt that remain in a liquid state at room temperature, have high chemical stability and high CO2 solubility, making them ideal candidates for CO2 storage. The combination of ions largely determines the properties of ILs. However, such combinatorial possibilities of cations and anions make it extremely challenging to exhaust the design space of ILs for efficient CO2 storage through conventional experiments.Machine learning is often used in drug discovery to create so-called molecular fingerprints alongside graph neural networks (GNNs) that treat molecules as graphs and use a matrix to identify molecular bonds and related properties. For the first time, Barati Farimani has developed both fingerprint-based ML models and GNNs that are able to predict the CO2 absorption in ionic liquids.\"Our GNN method achieves superior accuracy in predicting the CO2 solubility in ion liquids,\" states Barati Farimani. \"Unlike previous ML methods that rely on handcrafted features, GNN directly learns the features from molecular graphs.\"Understanding how machine learning models make decisions is just as important as the molecular properties they identify. This explanation provides researchers with extra insight into how the structure of the molecule affects the property of ionic liquids from a data-driven perspective. For example, Barati Farmimani's team found that molecular fragments that physically interact with CO2 are less important than those that have a chemical interaction. Additionally, those with less hydrogen connected to nitrogen could be more favorable in formalizing a stable chemical interaction with CO2.These findings, published in ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering, will enable researchers to advise on the design of novel and efficient ionic liquids for CO2 storage in the future.

  "answer_squad": " polyethylene glycol",
  "text": "The vast majority of absorbent materials will lose their ability to retain water as temperatures rise. This is why our skin starts to sweat and why plants dry out in the heat. Even materials that are designed to soak up moisture, such as the silica gel packs in consumer packaging, will lose their sponge-like properties as their environment heats up.          But one material appears to uniquely resist heat's drying effects. MIT engineers have now found that polyethylene glycol (PEG)\u2014a hydrogel commonly used in cosmetic creams, industrial coatings, and pharmaceutical capsules\u2014can absorb moisture from the atmosphere even as temperatures climb.The material doubles its water absorption as temperatures climb from 25 to 50 degrees Celsius (77 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit), the team reports.PEG's resilience stems from a heat-triggering transformation. As its surroundings heat up, the hydrogel's microstructure morphs from a crystal to a less organized \"amorphous\" phase, which enhances the material's ability to capture water.Based on PEG's unique properties, the team developed a model that can be used to engineer other heat-resistant, water-absorbing materials. The group envisions such materials could one day be made into devices that harvest moisture from the air for drinking water, particularly in arid desert regions. The materials could also be incorporated into heat pumps and air conditioners to more efficiently regulate temperature and humidity.\"A huge amount of energy consumption in buildings is used for thermal regulation,\" says Lenan Zhang, a research scientist in MIT's Department of Mechanical Engineering. \"This material could be a key component of passive climate-control systems.\"Zhang and his colleagues detail their work in a study appearing today in Advanced Materials. MIT co-authors include Xinyue Liu, Bachir El Fil, Carlos Diaz-Marin, Yang Zhong, Xiangyu Li, and Evelyn Wang, along with Shaoting Lin of Michigan State University.Against intuitionEvelyn Wang's group in MIT's Device Research Lab aims to address energy and water challenges through the design of new materials and devices that sustainably manage water and heat. The team discovered PEG's unusual properties as they were assessing a slew of similar hydrogels for their water-harvesting abilities.\"We were looking for a high-performance material that could capture water for different applications,\" Zhang says. \"Hydrogels are a perfect candidate, because they are mostly made of water and a polymer network. They can simultaneously expand as they absorb water, making them ideal for regulating humidity and water vapor.\"The team analyzed a variety of hydrogels, including PEG, by placing each material on a scale that was set within a climate-controlled chamber. A material became heavier as it absorbed more moisture. By recording a material's changing weight, the researchers could track its ability to absorb moisture as they tuned the chamber's temperature and humidity.What they observed was typical of most materials: as the temperature increased, the hyrogels' ability to capture moisture from the air decreased. The reason for this temperature-dependence is well-understood: With heat comes motion, and at higher temperatures, water molecules move faster and are therefore more difficult to contain in most materials.\"Our intuition tells us that at higher temperatures, materials tend to lose their ability to capture water,\" says co-author Xinyue Liu. \"So, we were very surprised by PEG because it has this inverse relationship.\"In fact, they found that PEG grew heavier and continued to absorb water as the researchers raised the chamber's temperature from 25 to 50 degrees Celsius.\"At first, we thought we had measured some errors, and thought this could not be possible,\" Liu says. \"After we double-checked everything was correct in the experiment, we realized this was really happening, and this is the only known material that shows increasing water absorbing ability with higher temperature.\"      A lucky catchThe group zeroed in on PEG to try and identify the reason for its unusual, heat-resilient performance. They found that the material has a natural melting point at around 50 degrees Celsius, meaning that the hydrogel's normally crystal-like microstructure completely breaks down and transforms into an amorphous phase. Zhang says that this melted, amorphous phase provides more opportunity for polymers in the material to grab hold of any fast-moving water molecules.\"In the crystal phase, there might be only a few sites on a polymer available to attract water and bind,\" Zhang says. \"But in the amorphous phase, you might have many more sites available. So, the overall performance can increase with increased temperature.\"The team then developed a theory to predict how hydrogels absorb water, and showed that the theory could also explain PEG's unusual behavior if the researchers added a \"missing term\" to the theory. That missing term was the effect of phase transformation. They found that when they included this effect, the theory could predict PEG's behavior, along with that of other temperature-limiting hydrogels.The discovery of PEG's unique properties was in large part by chance. The material's melting temperature just happens to be within the range where water is a liquid, enabling them to catch PEG's phase transformation and its resulting super-soaking behavior. The other hydrogels happen to have melting temperatures that fall outside this range. But the researchers suspect that these materials are also capable of similar phase transformations once they hit their melting temperatures.\"Other polymers could in theory exhibit this same behavior, if we can engineer their melting points within a selected temperature range,\" says team member Shaoting Lin.Now that the group has worked out a theory, they plan to use it as a blueprint to design materials specifically for capturing water at higher temperatures.\"We want to customize our design to make sure a material can absorb a relatively high amount of water, at low humidity and high temperatures,\" Liu says. \"Then it could be used for atmospheric water harvesting, to bring people potable water in hot, arid environments.\" More information:Xinyue Liu et al, Unusual Temperature Dependence of Water Sorption in Semicrystalline Hydrogels, Advanced Materials (2023).

  "text": "Today, over half of the total energy produced from fossil fuels is discarded as waste heat, which accelerates global warming. If we could convert the waste heat into a more useful form of energy like electricity, we could minimize fuel consumption and reduce our carbon footprint. In this regard, thermoelectric energy conversion has gained momentum as a technology for generating electricity from waste heat.          For efficient conversion, a thermoelectric material must have a high conversion efficiency (ZT). So far, realizing a high ZT has been possible only with the use of heavy elements like lead, bismuth, and tellurium. However, the use of rare, expensive, and environmentally toxic elements such as these has limited the large-scale application of thermoelectric energy conversion.To tackle these issues, transition metal oxides based on platforms such as SrTiO3 have emerged as a more inexpensive and benign alternative. However, their ZT is typically limited by a high thermal conductivity (\u03ba), since for a high \u03ba, the temperature across the material becomes uniform more quickly, and the lowered temperature difference\u2014the driving force behind the thermoelectric conversion\u2014causes electric power generation to decrease as well.Against this backdrop, a research team including Associate Professor Takayoshi Katase from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan recently discovered a new approach to reducing \u03ba and boosting the performance of SrTiO3 by hydrogen substitution.Conventionally, the use of light elements is expected to increase the \u03ba originating from lattice vibration (\u03balat), leading to the adoption of heavy elements to reduce the \u03balat. In contrast, in their study published in Advanced Functional Materials, the team discovered that the \u03balat of SrTiO3 could be reduced to less than half its original value by substituting a light element, namely hydrogen.They clarified the mechanism underlying their observation using first-principles calculations, which showed that substituting a portion of the oxygen anions (O\u2212) with hydrogen anions (H\u2212), yielding compounds of the form SrTiO3\u2212xHx, results in a mixture comprising a strong Ti-O bond and a weak Ti-H bond. These randomly distributed Ti-(O,H) bonds, in turn, largely decrease \u03balat.The team also found that SrTiO3\u2212xHx polycrystals exhibit high electron mobility comparable to that of single-crystal materials without any deterioration in electron conduction across grain boundaries. Based on these two effects, a low thermal conductivity along with a high electrical output power are realized at the same time, resulting in an improved thermoelectric conversion efficiency in the SrTiO3\u2212xHx polycrystal.Overall, these findings can open doors to innovative strategies for developing next-generation thermoelectric materials. \"In future, the hydrogen substitution approach would realize excellent environmentally benign thermoelectric materials that do not require the use of heavy elements,\" concludes Dr. Katase.

  "text": "Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation reaction has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of its importance in solar energy conversion. For such a sluggish four-hole and four-proton transfer reaction in a long timescale of ms\u2013s, more and more studies have shown that the accumulation of multiple surface-trapped holes (e.g., high-valent iron oxo on hematite surfaces) or \"oxidizing equivalents\" is a prerequisite for efficient PEC water oxidation process. Previous PEC water oxidation studies commonly apply high potentials (>1.2 VRHE) to achieve this key. But how to complete multi-hole transfer under low bias (near the onset potential) remains unknown.       A study, published in  published in the journal Science China Chemistry and led by Prof. Yuchao Zhang (Key Laboratory of Photochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences), sought to address this topic.Zhang's research group studied the important role of excitation energy in the multi-hole accumulation process. PEC characterizations and rate law analysis showed that the UV excitation could significantly boost the accumulation of multiple surface-trapped holes, thereby cathodically shifting the onset potential by 220 mV and improving the PEC water oxidation activity by one order of magnitude.Subsequent bulk transport dynamics and surface charge-transfer kinetics demonstrated that compared with the visible-light excitation, the UV excitation reduced the formation probability of self-trapped excitons and resulted in ~3 to 5-fold increase of surface holes, which accounted for the promoted multi-hole accumulation process.These advantages enable the UV excitation to contribute about 40% to the total photocurrent under 1 solar illumination, even though its energy only occupies 6% of the incident light. This mechanism was also applicable to boost other multi-hole catalysis (such as the oxidation of thioether and nitrite) under low bias.

The dark bluish solar panels that dot rooftops and open fields today are typically made from silicon, a well-tested semiconductor material. Silicon photovoltaic technology has its limitations, though, losing up to 40% of the energy it collects from sunlight in the form of heat waste. Researchers at Colorado State University are studying radical new ways to improve solar power and provide more options for the industry to explore.CSU chemists are proposing to make solar cells using not silicon, but an abundantly available natural material called molybdenum disulfide.

Farah is a former Ph.D. student in Krummel's lab.

Sambur's lab had become interested in molybdenum sulfide as a possible alternative solar material based on preliminary data on its light absorption capabilities even when only three atoms thick, explained Austin.That's when they turned to Krummel, whose lab contains a state-of-the-art ultrafast pump-probe transient absorption spectrometer that can very precisely measure the sequential energy states of individual electrons as they are excited with a laser pulse. Experiments using this special instrument can provide snapshots of how charges flow in a system. Austin created a photoelectrochemical cell using a single atomic layer of molybdenum sulfide, and she and Farah used the pump-probe laser to track the cooling of electrons as they moved through the material.What they found was astoundingly efficient light-to-energy conversion. More importantly, the laser spectroscopy experiments enabled them to show why this efficient conversion was possible.They found that the material was so good at converting light to energy because its crystal structure allows it to extract and exploit the energy of so-called hot carriers, which are highly energetic electrons that are briefly excited from their ground states when hit with enough visible light. Austin and Farah found that in their photoelectrochemical cell, the energy from these hot carriers was immediately converted into photocurrent, rather than lost as heat. This hot carrier extraction phenomenon is not present in conventional silicon solar cells.\"This work paves the way for knowing how to design reactors that contain these nanoscale materials for efficient and large-scale hydrogen production,\" Sambur said.The project was a collaboration with Professor Andr\u00e9s Montoya-Castillo and Dr. Thomas Sayer of University of Colorado Boulder, who contributed theoretical chemistry and computational modeling to help explain and verify the experimental data.\"The discovery required a 'team science' approach that brought together many different types of expertise, in computational, analytical and physical chemistry,\" Krummel said.

  "text": "Microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) are the detection indicator of food microbiological contamination. During metabolic process, microorganisms in food produce about 2,000 kinds of volatile metabolites with different chemical properties, including alcohols, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, acids, ketones, ethers, esters, etc.       The low concentration, variety, and large polar span of mVOCs lead to the difficulty of detection. Therefore, efficient sample pretreatment technology, highly sensitive analytical instruments and reliable data analysis methods are the key to the enrichment and detection of mVOCs.Researchers from the Wuhan Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have reviewed recent advances in mVOCs detection. They summarized the types and mechanisms of mVOCs, as well as the sampling methods of mVOCs such as headspace, purge and trap, solid phase microextraction and needle trap.They also systematically reviewed the analytical methods of mVOCs (ion migration spectrometry, electronic nose method, biosensor, etc.) and their applications in the detection of microbial contamination in food. The study was published in Food Chemistry on March 15.According to the study, portable equipment, emerging new materials, high throughput and field detection, cost-effective and mass production of analytical instruments will become the promising direction of mVOCs detection in the future.

  "text": "The biomedical optics research team in Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), has developed a device for on-site immediate detection of pathogen nucleic acid. Their research results were published in Analytica Chimica Acta.          Microfluidic chips have been widely used in the nucleic acid detection of pathogens. The chips often use magnetic beads or silica gel films with high specific surface area to adsorb nucleic acid, but it may also lead to more residual fluid release agents and impurities. Therefore, microfluidic chips usually need to integrate multiple reagent storage tubes and perform fluid control in combination with microvalves and micropumps, to realize nucleic acid extraction and impurity cleaning. The complicated structure increases the complexity of the preparation process and supporting detection equipment of microfluidic chips.In this study, the researchers developed the mobile kit (Mkit) consisting of a chitosan-modified minimalistic microfluidic chip (CM3-chip) and smartphone, which realized the point-of-care testing of the nucleic acid of pathogens.The lumen wall of CM3-chip was modified with chitosan. Under acidic pH conditions, the primary amine in chitosan (pKa = 6.2 to 7.0) was positively charged. The Hofmeister effect showed that protonated amines were more likely to bond to negatively charged nucleic acids than other ions through the electrostatic interactions. CM3-chip could be directly amplified in situ after the enrichment of nucleic acid. Smartphones were used to control the whole process of detection, including temperature control, image acquisition, data processing and result analysis.Mkit has many advantages over traditional methods, including no centrifugation, no complex cleaning, no magnet attachment, and high sensitivity.A series of biological experiments showed that the detection equipment is universally applicable, selective, and user-friendly, and it can identify respiratory infectious agents with similar clinical symptoms. Artificially prepared saliva samples of H5N6 and IAV infections were also detected by Mkit.

  "text": "A viable formula for a carbon-negative, environmentally friendly concrete that is nearly as strong as regular concrete has been developed at Washington State University.          In a proof-of-concept work, the researchers infused regular cement with environmentally friendly biochar, a type of charcoal made from organic waste, that had been strengthened beforehand with concrete wastewater. The biochar was able to suck up to 23% of its weight in carbon dioxide from the air while still reaching a strength comparable to ordinary cement.The research could significantly reduce carbon emissions of the concrete industry, which is one of the most energy- and carbon-intensive of all manufacturing industries. The work, led by doctoral student Zhipeng Li, is reported in the journal, Materials Letters.\"We're very excited that this will contribute to the mission of zero-carbon built environment,\" said Xianming Shi, professor in the WSU Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the corresponding author on the paper.More than 4 billion tons of concrete are produced every year globally. Making ordinary cement requires high temperature and combustion of fuels. The limestone used in its production also goes through decomposition which produces carbon dioxide, so that cement production is thought to be responsible for about 8% of total carbon emissions by human activities worldwide.Researchers have tried adding biochar as a substitute in cement to make it more environmentally friendly and reduce its carbon footprint, but adding even 3% of biochar dramatically reduced the strength of the concrete. After treating biochar in the concrete washout wastewater, the WSU researchers were able to add up to 30% biochar to their cement mixture. The paste made of the biochar-amended cement was able to reach a compressive strength after 28 days comparable to that of ordinary cement of about 4,000 pounds per square inch.\"We're committed to finding novel ways to divert waste streams to beneficial uses in concrete; once we identify those waste streams, the next step is to see how we can wave the magic wand of chemistry and turn them into a resource,\" said Shi. \"The trick is really in the interfacial engineering\u2014how you engineer the interfaces in the concrete.\"The caustic concrete washout water is a sometimes problematic waste material from concrete production. The wastewater is very alkaline but also serves as a valuable source of calcium, said Shi. The researchers used the calcium to induce the formation of calcite, which benefits the biochar and eventually the concrete incorporating the biochar.\"Most other researchers were only able to add up to 3% biochar to replace cement, but we're demonstrating the use of much higher dosages of biochar because we've figured out how to engineer the surface of the biochar,\" he said.The synergy between the highly alkaline wastewater that contains a lot of calcium and the highly porous biochar meant that calcium carbonate precipitated onto or into the biochar, strengthening it and allowing for the capture of carbon dioxide from the air. A concrete made of the material would be expected to continue sequestering carbon dioxide for the lifetime of the concrete, typically 30 years in pavement or 75 years in a bridge.In order to commercialize this technology, the researchers have been working with the Office of Commercialization to protect the intellectual property and have filed a provisional patent application on their carbon-negative concrete work.

  "answer_squad": " 24 hours",
  "text": "Researchers have made huge strides in ensuring that red blood cell substitutes\u2014or artificial blood\u2014are able to work safely and effectively when transfused into the bloodstream.          The key is to make the artificial blood molecules big enough so they don't leak from blood vessels into tissue and cause dangerous cardiovascular side effects, notes a new study led by researchers from The Ohio State University.Although blood loss is typically treated by transfusing units of donated blood, in cases where transfusions aren't readily available or time is too limited to screen for patient blood type compatibility (such as in certain rural areas or on the battlefield), artificial blood products offer medical professionals more flexibility for treatment. In clinical trials, previous generations of these blood substitutes often resulted in several poor health outcomes, as individuals experienced symptoms ranging from narrowing of blood vessels and high blood pressure to tissue injury.In this study, researchers found that a certain sized fraction of red blood cell substitute can provide a range of health benefits, and can decrease the risk of cardiovascular side effects\u2014if its components are the right size.\"We found that as you make the red blood cell substitute molecules bigger, you have fewer side effects,\" said Alisyn Greenfield, lead author of the study and a Ph.D. student in chemical and biomolecular engineering at Ohio State. \"There's even a particular size range that has better benefits when it comes to the kind of cardiovascular effects that were seen with with previous generations of this material.\"Their findings were published in the journal Biomacromolecules.The researchers tested a red blood cell substitute called polymerized human hemoglobin\u2014PolyhHb. Although past commercial versions have been explored in clinical settings, they did not receive FDA approval due to their many side effects.To find a better solution, the team focused on identifying a target therapeutic size of PolyhHb by synthesizing material in four different-sized brackets and exploring the cardiovascular response in guinea pig models. Findings showed that the largest-sized brackets did not escape the blood vessels, or cause the blood vessels to narrow and elicit high blood pressure.Study senior author Andre Palmer, professor of chemical and biochemical engineering at Ohio State, said the antioxidant status of guinea pigs is more similar to humans than other rodents, making them a good model for the study.While these red blood cell substitutes aren't meant to replace blood entirely, this research highlights the potential of these materials. If transfused into a person soon after injury, they could be used to buy the person enough time to be transported to a medical facility to receive a blood transfusion, said Palmer.Additionally, because blood substitutes aren't made with any surface antigens or markers on the outside of the red blood cell's membrane, they can be transfused into anyone, regardless of their blood type. That said, artificial blood is still a long way from commercialization.Even though it can be stored at room temperature for several years compared to the 42-day storage period for donated blood, artificial blood doesn't come close to replicating the lifetime of real blood cells, said Palmer. Once produced, a typical red blood cell circulates in the human body for a period of about 120 days, yet the materials in current blood substitutes are made with only a half-life of about 24 hours after administration.Further study is needed to more accurately determine the red blood cell substitute's safety and efficacy in clinical settings. \"By performing this study, we demonstrated that we can improve upon what currently exists and, hopefully, be able to move our research forward and translate those materials into the clinic,\" said Greenfield.

  "text": "Bifunctional acid\u2212base catalysts are highly desirable for industrially relevant chemical processes. Owing to their ability to activate electrophiles and nucleophiles simultaneously, they allow the catalysis to proceed synergistically and cooperatively. Solid acid\u2212base catalysts are particularly advantageous since they are reusable and result in no waste products.          However, controlling the structure of such catalysts for cooperatively workable active sites is challenging. Simple and effective methods that enable the synthesis of high-performance solid acid\u2212base catalysts with desirable properties are thus required.A team of researchers led by Professor Keigo Kamata from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan have now proposed such a simple sol\u2013gel method for the synthesis of highly pure bifunctional solid acid\u2212base catalysts of perovskite-type oxides, advancing the frontiers of catalysis research. Their study was published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.Explaining the rationale for selecting perovskite-type oxides, Prof. Kamata says, \"Perovskite-type oxides are gaining importance in several fields, including magneticity, ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and catalysis. Moreover, the structure and physiochemical properties of perovskite-type oxides can be tuned by controlling their chemical composition.\"Perovskite-type oxides have a versatile composition and demonstrate good structural stability, flexibility, and controllability for several catalytic reactions. But they have not been sufficiently explored for acid\u2013base-catalyzed reactions. Moreover, the existing methods for synthesis are complex, time-consuming, and require multiple steps, making it difficult to synthesize highly pure and desirable perovskite oxide catalysts.The sol\u2013gel method developed by the team to circumvent these challenges has two key steps. The first involves preparing the precursor perovskite material, while the second comprises a calcination process to improve the surface area of the material.To prepare the precursor, the researchers dissolved a metal alkoxide containing either titanium (Ti4+), zirconium (Zr4+), or niobium (Nb5+) cations to a solution containing malic acid and hydrogen peroxide. They then added a metal acetate containing an A-site element to the solution and dried it to form a powdered precursor.Next, they subjected the precursor to a calcination process by heating it to 550\u00b0C in a nitrogen atmosphere and exposing it to air for 5 hours. The high temperature and the presence of oxygen crystallized the precursor and increased its surface area.Of the various catalysts synthesized using this method, the one with SrTiO3 nanoparticles (Sr: strontium) displayed the highest catalytic activity. It enabled efficient cyanosilylation of acetophenone with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) under mild reaction conditions without any thermal pretreatment.Upon examining the catalyst further, the team found its specific surface area (46 m2/g) to be 10 times higher than those of commercially available titanates (1\u20134 m2/g). Prof. Kamata adds, \"We observed that the synthesized nanoparticles could activate TMSCN on the basic oxygen site and the carbonyl compound on the acidic Ti site. This cooperative activation mechanism was responsible for the high catalytic activity of the catalyst for the cyanosilylation reaction.\"In summary, this straightforward method for synthesizing highly pure perovskite oxides for catalysis could become a promising strategy for enabling reactions requiring mild conditions.

  "text": "Self-assembled peptide supramolecular hydrogels have shown great application prospects in various areas, including tissue engineering, drug delivery, and biosensing.          Precisely and flexibly controlling the mechanical properties of peptide hydrogels to match the targeted applications is important. The common methods to regulate the mechanical properties of supramolecular hydrogels generally include: changing the formula (different peptide sequences, adding cross-linking agents) or changing the environmental conditions (concentration, temperature, pH and ions), both of which inevitably change the chemical composition of the hydrogel.Now, researchers from the Institute of Process Engineering (IPE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have explored strategies to control the mechanical properties of hydrogels by using the liquid\u2013liquid phase separation (LLPS)-mediated self-assembly principle without changing the chemical composition of hydrogels.The study was published in Matter.In the preparation of hydrogels, the number and size of phase-separated droplets are well-controlled in the early stage of self-assembly in order to tune the nanostructure of self-assembled precursors. These precursors can be urchin-like fibrils, beaded spindle-like fibrils, or radial fibril clusters.When it comes to further fibril growth and formation of a non-covalent cross-linking network, the structural difference between precursors leads to a difference in fibril diameter, number of fibrils, and cross-linking density of the network, thus forming hydrogel materials with different mechanical strength and recoverability.The researchers found that tuning incubation temperature and time through process sequencing could control the self-assembled precursors. An optimal initial incubation temperature could lead to optimal mechanical strength and recoverability when the chemical composition of the hydrogel remained unchanged. The optimal initial temperature was precisely the temperature at which the droplets were transformed into nanofibrils.They further confirmed through experiments and molecular simulation that at the phase transition temperature, peptide molecules showed a strong aggregation propensity, de-solvation effect, and dynamic metastable hydrogen bonding, which was conducive to fibril branching, thus enabling the hydrogel to obtain the best nanofibril strength and cross-linking density under the condition of constant concentration.

Current challenges in this topic such as thermal dissipation in microelectronics, necessary to prevent devices from overheating, can be addressed by designing new functional materials with tunable thermal conductivity. Liquid crystals are a very interesting family of materials, with appealing applications such as LCD screens.The new study shows that azobenzene molecules can be used to control the thermal conductivity of liquid crystals using ultraviolet light.\"Azobenzenes are a class of molecules whose structure changes with light, so that when added into a liquid crystal, the transport of heat through the whole system can be modified by irradiating it with ultraviolet light,\" says Noa Varela, Ph.D. student at CiQUS and first author of the study. \"Depending on the molecular arrangement of the liquid crystal, either a increase or decrease of the thermal conductivity can be achieved upon illumination, at room temperature.\"Given the huge variety of available liquid crystals, the work arisen from the synergy between F.

  "text": "Conventional transportation equipment relies heavily on steel. But steel is heavy, and scientists are turning to alternatives in the quest to improve the safety and speed of transportation, while simultaneously lessening its environmental footprint.          Magnesium alloys, with their low density and excellent strength-to-weight ratio, are considered the next-generation base metal for multi-material design and have been touted as a possible replacement for conventional steels when appropriate.Although progress has been made in overcoming certain weaknesses associated with magnesium alloys, such as flammability, developing bonding technology that bonds magnesium alloys with structural steels has been severely limited because magnesium and iron are immiscible and do not form at the alloy phase.Yet, a research group from Tohoku University has succeeded in establishing a dealloying bonding technology that obtains a strong mechanical bond between iron and magnesium. The findings are published in the journal Scripta Materialia.\"Our dealloying reaction derives from the miscibility and immiscibility of the constituent elements in the bond, and also helped create a three-dimensional, interlocked microstructure at the interface of the two materials,\" said Kota Kurabayashi, a master's student at the Graduate School of Engineering, who co-authored the study along with Professor Hidemi Kato and Associate Professor Takeshi Wada from the Institute for Materials Research.Kato also points out that this approach provides an ideal mechanical bonding method that creates a strong anchoring effect between materials that cannot form strong bonds.Looking ahead, the research group plans to harness the advance dealloying technique to bond immiscible dissimilar materials and produce new light-weight materials that reduce the fuel consumption of automobiles, trains, and airplanes.

  "text": "Researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a machine-learning inspired software package that provides end-to-end image analysis of electron and scanning probe microscopy images.          Known as AtomAI, the package applies deep learning to microscopy data at atomic resolutions, thereby providing quantifiable physical information such as the precise position and type of each atom in a sample.Using these methods, researchers can quickly derive statistically meaningful information from immensely complex datasets. These datasets routinely include hundreds of images that each contain thousands of atoms and abnormalities in molecular structure. This improvement to data analysis allows researchers to engineer quantum atomically precise abnormalities in materials, and can be used to gain deeper insights into the materials' physical and chemical qualities.Electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy allow materials scientists, physicists and other researchers to probe atomic and molecular structures at extremely high resolutions. These high-resolution methods allow researchers to clearly observe atomic structures, making them an important tool in understanding and engineering materials at the nanoscale.Electron microscopy is useful for gaining precise information on the structure of a material, whereas scanning probe microscopy is more often used to learn about a material's functional properties, such as superconductivity or magnetism. Both methods benefit from modern image analysis methods.Deep learning is a kind of machine learning that allows a program to train itself to accurately identify the contents of an image or block of text. When traditional machine learning is applied to image analysis, relevant features are manually extracted from a set of images\u2014a process known as feature engineering\u2014and used to create a model that categorizes objects based on those features.In contrast, deep learning models automatically learn relevant features by using a network of layered \"neurons\"\u2014biologically-inspired nodes through which data and computations flow\u2014trained to detect various aspects of an image at different levels of complexity. This allows for increased precision and the analysis of more diverse information when compared with traditional machine learning, so long as enough data exists to train the system.      AtomAI, which was developed partially at ORNL's Center for Nanophase Materials Science, includes a unique model architecture to identify thin objects such as nanofibers or domain walls\u2014the interfaces separating magnetic domains\u2014in microscopy data. The software package is also built to reduce errors in image processing by accounting for unintended changes in the image data, such as incoming cosmic rays or images of non-target materials, and by incorporating certain unchanging physical characteristics into the model.Also, AtomAI includes tools that allow researchers to conduct real-time analysis of the data being gathered and to import information directly into theoretical simulations. These features are useful for gaining insights into the energetics and optical, electronic and magnetic properties of the physical structures being observed.An overview of the software package was published in Nature Machine Intelligence.\"People used to treat microscopy as a purely qualitative tool,\" said Maxim Ziatdinov, a researcher at ORNL and the lead developer of AtomAI, \"but recently there was sort of a shift in the mindset of the community: Microscopy can actually be used to extract quantitative physical information.\" Qualitative microscopy methods generally rely on researchers noting holistic information about a sample, while the new quantitative methods allow for precise numerical representations of a material's structure or properties.Software such as AtomAI has enabled this shift, providing a method to quantitatively analyze the structures of whole samples to find meaningful data that qualitative methods might misrepresent or simply not notice.Ziatdinov expects his team's work to accelerate the rate of progress in both fundamental and applied materials research. \"If you can characterize things faster and automate at least some parts of the process, then you will also speed up all aspects of materials science research,\" he said.AtomAI was designed with ease of use and access in mind. The entire package can be launched from a browser and requires minimal coding knowledge to operate.\"If you're an experimentalist, then you should be able to use machine learning without knowing all the math behind the process and without necessarily being a good coder,\" Ziatdinov said.AtomAI is a complete software package, and Ziatdinov and his team expect to expand its capabilities and support more features.

  "text": "McMaster University researchers have developed a rapid and inexpensive test for Salmonella contamination in chicken and other food\u2014one that's easier to use than a home COVID test.          The test, described in a new paper in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition, could improve food safety, reduce the cost of processing fresh poultry and other foods, and help to limit broad recalls to batches that have specifically been identified as contaminated.The researchers have shown that the test provides accurate results in an hour or less without the need for accessories or a power source, compared to today's monitoring through lab cultures, which require at least a full day to produce results.Once scaled up and made available commercially, the new test could be a significant boon to poultry processors, for whom Salmonella is among the most significant contamination risks. The test would also be beneficial for ensuring the safe processing of other foods that are particularly vulnerable to Salmonella, such as eggs, dairy products and ground beef.A single major poultry processor performs tens of thousands of Salmonella lab tests each year. Reducing or even eliminating the need for overnight lab cultures would represent significant savings and make it easier to identify contamination earlier in the process.McMaster University researchers demonstrate and explain their new lab-free test for Salmonella contamination.

If it's cheap, reliable and easy, why not use it?\"Protecting the public from Salmonella is a high priority for food producers, retailers and regulators alike, since Salmonella is one of the most common and serious forms of food-borne infection, causing 155,000 deaths globally every year.What makes the test work is a new synthetic nucleic acid molecule, developed at McMaster. For the test, the molecule is sandwiched between microscopic particles such as gold.The test platform lines the inside of the tip of a pipette and begins to work when a liquefied sample of the food being tested is drawn inside the tube.      If Salmonella bacteria are present, they cut through the particles, allowing the molecule to escape.                McMaster University's new Salmonella test indicates the presence of Salmonella by producing a red dot on test paper.

  "answer_squad": " one that has been accepted for more than five decades",
  "text": "The process of reverse osmosis has proven to be the state-of-the-art method for removing salt from seawater and increasing access to clean water. Other applications include wastewater treatment and energy production.          Now a team of researchers reveal in a new study that the standard explanation for how reverse osmosis works\u2014one that has been accepted for more than five decades\u2014is fundamentally wrong. In the process, the researchers offer an alternate theory. Besides correcting the record, these insights could lead to more effective uses of reverse osmosis. The results of the study, led by the lab of Prof. Menachem Elimelech, are published in Science Advances.Reverse osmosis\u2014a technology first put to use in the 1960s\u2014removes salt and impurities from water by passing the water through a semipermeable membrane, which allows the water to go through while blocking the contaminants. To explain exactly how it works, researchers have used the theory of solution-diffusion. This theory assumes that the water molecules dissolve and diffuse through the membrane by way of their concentration gradient\u2014that is, the molecules move from areas of high concentration to wherever there are fewer molecules. Although this theory has been widely accepted for more than 50 years and is even taught in textbooks, Elimelech said he has long had questions about it.\"Some of the assumptions do not make any sense,\" said Elimelech, the Sterling Professor of Chemical and Environmental Engineering. For instance, he said, the theory is based in part on the idea that pressure across the membrane is constant. \"Whenever you have water flow through any porous material, there is always a pressure drop.\"To get a better sense of the physics involved, the research team\u2014which included scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Texas Tech University\u2014did a combination of experiments and computer simulations. Specifically, they used simulations of the molecules' movements, which revealed that water transport is driven by changes in pressure within the membranes. They further show that water molecules travel as clusters through a network of pores in the membrane. This contrasts with the conventional theory based on the solution-diffusion model, which assumes that the water molecules separate from each other in the membranes.Supplementing the computer simulations, the scientists performed experiments that allowed them to observe water passing through membranes. The results showed that the way that water permeates the membrane depends on the membrane pore size, the size of the water molecules, and viscosity of the water. This was also inconsistent with the solution-diffusion model.Overall, the simulations and experiments demonstrated that, rather than being driven by the concentration of molecules, reverse osmosis is driven by pressure changes within the membrane.Because previous measurements related to reverse osmosis were based on a faulty understanding of it on a molecular level, Elimelech said, many attempts to advance the field have met a dead end. Having a more accurate theory to explain reverse osmosis, he said, could open the way toward developing more effective materials and techniques to improve the process.

  "text": "Hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources can be used as fuels that do not contribute to CO2 emissions, and therefore is emerging as an important future power source.          In South Australia, there are plans to open the world's largest hydrogen power plant near Whyalla, as part of an expansive Hydrogen Jobs Plan, which underlines the timeliness of the latest research by Flinders University, University of Adelaide and Tokyo University of Science experts.\"It's an exciting time to be involved in hydrogen science, and there are rapid advances being made to ensure the greatest possible efficiency of hydrogen production,\" says Flinders Professor of Chemical Physics Gunther Andersson, first author in a new article outlining the method in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising technique to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using semiconductor particles as photocatalysts. While researchers understand that the structural and electronic properties of photocatalyst semiconductors play a major role in determining photocatalytic activity, their goal is to find the best and most efficient material to assist this process\u2014which they have found to be chromium oxide.\"Cocatalysts can promote efficient photocatalytic water splitting by supporting the electron and hold separation and acts as active sites for the water splitting reaction,\" says Professor Andersson, who is Deputy Director of the Flinders University Institute for NanoScale Science and Technology at the College of Science and Engineering.\"However, the cocatalyst requires a protective overlayer to suppress the H2 and O2 recombination which will result in a backward reaction that takes H2 and O2 back to H2O.\"We need to find the right overlayer material to ensure the most efficient photocatalytic water splitting\u2014and this led us to explore mixed transition metal oxides.\"The researchers found that chromium oxide overlayers protect the water splitting process in photocatalysis for solar light driven hydrogen production.Their work investigated the stability, oxidation state and the bulk and surface electronic structure of chromium-oxide photodeposited onto different particles as a function of the annealing process.Importantly, the international research team also found that the chromium oxide overlayers do not contribute to the water splitting reaction.Senior co-author University of Adelaide Professor of Chemistry Gregory Metha adds, \"World-leading photocatalysts have chromium oxide overlayers and this work reveals new insights into the nature of the coating that could lead to improvements in future materials.\"It is known that chromium oxide overlayers protect the water splitting process in photocatalysis for solar light driven hydrogen production. The researchers found that the thermal stability of the chromium oxide overlayer depends on the chemical nature of the underlying photocatalyst.\"Understanding the stability, oxidation state, and electronic structure of the chromium-oxide layer on photocatalyst particles under annealing is essential for overlayer applications in photocatalytic water splitting,\" says Professor Andersson.

  "answer_squad": " Lebedev process",
  "text": "A key ingredient in the manufacture of car tires and sneaker soles could be made sustainably, following new analysis of an old catalytic process. Butadiene, an essential component of synthetic rubber, is currently produced by the petrochemical industry from fossil reserves.          But it could be efficiently made in a one-step reaction from renewable ethanol using a modernized version of an unusual old catalyst. \"Butadiene is currently produced as a byproduct of the petrochemical industry, which can lead to shortages in its supply,\" explains Sang-Ho Chung, a research scientist in the labs of Javier Ruiz-Martinez, with whom he co-led the work. \"Also, these routes are clearly not sustainable,\" he adds.These challenges in butadiene production have sparked renewed interest in the Lebedev process, first developed in the 1930s, that converts ethanol to butadiene in a single catalytic reactor. \"Sustainable butadiene could be made by using bioethanol in the Lebedev process or even ethanol made using cutting-edge CO -to-ethanol processes,\" Chung says.The Lebedev process is driven by silica-magnesia catalysts that are produced by an unusual method called wet kneading. The method involves combining solid catalyst precursors in water under continuous mixing.\"Wet kneading is quite uncommon in catalyst preparation, but it is often applied to prepare high-performance silicamagnesia catalysts for the Lebedev process,\" Ruiz-Martinez says.Find out how KAUST researchers are developing sustainable catalysts. Credit: 2023 KAUSTHowever, improved wet-kneaded catalysts have mainly been discovered by trial and error. Why some catalysts outperform others is not fully understood, and \"understanding how these materials form is the first step to preparing better catalysts,\" Ruiz-Martinez says.Chung, Ruiz-Martinez and their KAUST colleagues used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study silica-magnesia catalyst formation under real wet kneading conditions. \"We found that two different catalyst particles are formed, based on the cross-deposition of silicon species onto magnesia and magnesium species onto silica,\" Chung says. The findings are published in the journal Nature Catalysis.Crucially, they showed that magnesium silicates on the silica particles tend to produce ethylene as an undesired side product. \"With that understanding, we could synthesize just the catalyst particles that are active for butadiene production and avoid the particles that produce ethylene,\" Chung says.The team also showed that the best catalysts also had certain active sites in very close proximity. \"This has helped us to work on the next generation of catalysts for this process,\" RuizMartinez says. \"We are making good progress and already have an even more selective version, which could be a key step for commercializing the process.\" More information:Sang-Ho Chung, Origin of active sites on silica\u2013magnesia catalysts and control of reactive environment in the one-step ethanol-to-butadiene process, Nature Catalysis (2023).

  "answer_squad": " a device with a spherical chamber into which heavy balls made of steel or other materials are placed",
  "text": "A team of chemists affiliated with several institutions in Germany has found that using a ball mill can speed up sublimation needed for testing gas interactions. In their study, reported in the journal Chem, the group tested the use of a ball mill to see how it would impact sublimation.          A ball mill is a device with a spherical chamber into which heavy balls made of steel or other materials are placed. The chamber is connected to other parts that turn the chamber. When other materials are placed into the chamber with the balls and the chamber is turned, the balls are pulled up the walls of the chamber until gravity takes over, at which point they fall, crushing the other material.In this way, as the chamber continues to spin, the secondary material can be crushed to produce a powder. In this new effort, the team looked to use the ball mill in a new way\u2014to speed up sublimation, in which a material changes from a solid to a gas without first becoming a liquid. There are occasions when chemists wish to sublimate a material to a gas and then combine that gas with another gas to form a new material or to incite a reaction. Unfortunately, the process of sublimation is generally pretty slow, so the team wanted to test the idea of using a ball mill.In their work, the researchers added new components to the spherical chamber\u2014inlets and exits for the gas. In their work, that meant argon and nitrogen. This allowed a steady stream of new gas to be injected into the chamber as gas was being sublimated from test materials as the chamber was spun. The mix of gases could then be continually vented from the exit valve to a secondary chamber where it could be tested using NMR spectroscopy.Testing of several materials showed that the process worked as hoped\u2014using the ball mill increased the rate of sublimation for all those tested, though to differing degrees, allowing for a constant stream of mixed gas to exit the chamber, ready for use in a desired application.

  "text": "Polypropylene, a hard-to-recycle plastic, has successfully been biodegraded by two strains of fungi in a new experiment led by researchers at the University of Sydney.          Polypropylene has long been recycling's head scratching riddle. A common plastic used for a wide variety of products from packaging and toys to furnishing and fashion, it accounts for roughly 28% of the world's plastic waste, but only 1% of it is recycled.Now, thanks to the efforts of researchers at the University of Sydney, the recalcitrant polymer may have met its match. Published April 14 in npj Materials Degradation, two common strains of fungi were used to successfully biodegrade polypropylene in a laboratory experiment.Typically found in soil and plants, Aspergillus terreus and Engyodontium album were able to break down polypropylene after it had been pre-treated with either UV light or heat, reducing the plastic by 21% over 30 days of incubation, and by 25%\u201327% over 90 days.\"Polypropylene is a common plastic used to make a huge variety of everyday products like food containers, coat hangers and cling film, but it only has a recycling rate of only one percent, meaning it is overrepresented in plastic waste and pollution globally,\" said the study's lead author from the University of Sydney's School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Ph.D. student Amira Farzana Samat.The researchers hope their method could one day reduce the vast amount of plastic polluting the environment and lead to a greater understanding of how plastic pollution might biodegrade naturally under certain conditions.\"Plastic pollution is by far one of the biggest waste issues of our time. The vast majority of it isn't adequately recycled, which means it often ends up in our oceans, rivers and in landfill. It's been estimated that 109 million tons of plastic pollution have accumulated in the world's rivers and 30 million tons now sit in the world's oceans\u2014with sources estimating this will soon surpass the total mass of fish,\" said Samat.                Engyodontium album. Credit: Amira Samat             The researchers say polypropylene is so infrequently recycled because of its short life as a packaging material and because it often becomes contaminated by other materials and plastics, necessitating new recycling methods that have minimal environmental impact.Samat's Ph.D. supervisor, Professor Ali Abbas from the School of Chemical and Molecular Engineering and Chief Circular Engineer at Circular Australia said, \"Despite the massive scale of plastic production and consumption, there has been very little attention paid to plastics degradation under environmental conditions, and our understanding of how plastics can be degraded is limited.\"\"One big question our result has raised is\u2014what are the naturally occurring conditions which can fast track the degradation of plastics? We seek to further explore the role of biological processes offered by fungi and other microorganisms.\"Professor Dee Carter, an expert in mycology (the study of fungi) in the School of Life and Environmental Sciences and co-author of the study said, \"Fungi are incredibly versatile and are known to be able to break down pretty much all substrates. This superpower is due to their production of powerful enzymes, which are excreted and used to break down substrates into simpler molecules that the fungal cells can then absorb.\"\"Often, these fungi have evolved to break down woody materials, but this ability can be repurposed to attack other substrates. This is why we find fungi growing on all sorts of man-made materials like carpets, painted furniture, tile grout, shower curtains, upholstery and even car headlights.\"Recent studies suggest some fungi may even degrade some of the 'forever chemicals' like PFAS, but the process is slow and not yet well understood. There is also evidence that the amount of plastic accumulated in the ocean is less than what might be expected based on production and disposal levels, and there is speculation that some of this 'missing' plastic may have been degraded by marine fungi.\"                How the experiment worked to biodegrade polypropylene. Credit: University of Sydney             How the process workedPolypropylene in various forms was initially treated with one of three separate methods: ultraviolet light, heat, and Fenton's reagent\u2014an acidic solution of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron often used to oxidize contaminants.In a petri dish, the fungi were applied separately as single cultures to treated polypropylene. The validity of the biodeterioration was then confirmed through microscopy techniques. While the research didn't evaluate how the plastic was degraded by the fungi or whether it was metabolized, the researchers hope to conduct further research to determine the type of bio-chemical processes taking place.Next stepsProfessor Abbas believes the low rate of plastics recycling globally presents a \"massive plastics circularity gap\": \"We need to support the development of disruptive recycling technologies that improve the circularity of plastics, especially those technologies that are driven by biological processes like in our study. It is important to note that our study did not yet carry out any optimization of the experimental conditions, so there is plenty of room to further reduce this degradation time.\"The researchers will now explore enhancing the overall efficiency in degrading polypropylene before seeking investment to scale the technology and develop a small-scale pilot prototype for commercialization.Since completing the study, the team has isolated other microorganisms from the marine environment and used a similar process to degrade marine plastic waste, with preliminary results showing even higher degradation.Samat said, \"We are quite excited about this and have started looking at different ways to improve the degradation process using these microorganisms. Watch this space.\" More information:Amira Farzana Samat et al, Biodeterioration of pre-treated polypropylene by Aspergillus terreus and Engyodontium album, npj Materials Degradation (2023).

  "text": "While the wheel does not need to be reinvented, there are benefits to the development of new nano-wheels, according to a multi-institute research team based in China. The group fabricated a novel family of metallic compounds, each of which exhibit unique properties desirable for next-generation technologies, such as advanced sensors.          Their findings were made available in Polyoxometalates.\"Polymetallic complexes are of great interest not only for their appealing molecular structure but also for their versatile applications in various fields,\" said co-corresponding author Yan-Zhen Zheng, professor in the Frontier Institute of Science and Technology (FIST) at Xi'an Jiaotong University.Polymetallic complexes, which comprise multiple atoms of various metals or a combination of metals and other elements, have the potential to imbue materials with specific properties if the molecules can be synthesized, Zheng said. Such properties include the ability to fluoresce, or glow, and magnetic quirks that allow drastic temperature changes and control.Zheng and his team focused on creating polymetallic complexes made with lanthanide elements, a group of 15 metallic materials also known as rare earth elements. They specifically used europium, terbium and gadolinium.\"Among all polymetallic complexes, lanthanide-based compounds have drawn unprecedented attention due to their interesting magnetic and luminescence behaviors,\" Zheng said. \"Several such compounds have been successfully isolated, but direct synthesis has been a challenge.\"The components of the complexes require are geometrically diverse, requiring significant coordination, according to Zheng.\"Previous findings revealed that controlling the hydrolysis\u2014breaking down a compound with water\u2014of lanthanide metal ions in the presence of appropriate organic ligands would be a powerful strategy to obtain desired species,\" Zheng said. A ligand is a molecule that bonds to a metal atom. Its addition to the complex can stabilize the structure.The researchers used hydrolysis to breakdown lanthanides in a bath containing a ligand called tricine. Tricine contains multiple arms of oxygen and hydrogen, meaning it can accommodate a large range of metals and help stabilize the resulting clusters.\"Through the simple hydrolysis reaction, we synthesized three lanthanide nano-clusters, and used X-ray diffraction analyses to reveal their stable, wheel-like structure,\" Zheng said. \"Owing to the presence of different lanthanide metal ions in these analogues, each compound shows distinctive properties.\"The europium-based cluster fluoresced red emissions, while the terbium-based cluster fluoresced green emissions. The gadolinium-based cluster exhibited potential applications in magnetic cooling. According to Zheng, the research group is continuing to investigate the synthesis and application of these clusters.

  "text": "Junior Associate Professor Kazuo Takayama and his research team used human airway organoids to screen autophagy-related compounds and found cycloheximide and thapsigargin to show strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2. Further testing revealed cycloheximide to be also effective against six SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains and other human coronaviruses. Results of this study were published online in Molecular Pharmaceutics on March 22, 2023.          Targeting host proteins involved in viral infections is an effective approach for dealing with viruses that mutate rapidly to produce new strains one after another. In this study, the scientists attempted to find COVID-19 therapeutic agents by focusing on autophagy. Autophagy is known to be closely involved with infection by SARS-CoV-2 and its elimination, thus making autophagy-related compounds potential COVID-19 therapeutic candidates.The research team screened a library of autophagy-related compounds with airway organoids to identify compounds that could control SARS-CoV-2 infection. From the 80 compounds tested, they found cycloheximide and thapsigargin to reduce infection efficiency in a dose-dependent manner.Because cycloheximide showed greater antiviral efficacy than thapsigargin, they further examined cycloheximide in detail. Cycloheximide also exhibited antiviral activity against six SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains, as well as against human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which suggests that cycloheximide has broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity. On the other hand, the researchers observed significant toxicity caused by cycloheximide in animal experiments due to its function as a protein synthesis inhibitor.Takayama believes less toxic derivatives or analogous compounds of cycloheximide that retain their antiviral effects hold great promise if developed in the future. In this study, the team demonstrated the feasibility of drug screening using human airway organoids, thus hinting at the possibility of combining the method with much larger compound libraries for more extensive COVID-19 therapeutic drug discovery.

  "text": "Discrete metal\u2013organic cages (MOCs) with unique cavities have attracted considerable research attention. Their accessible hydrophobic inner spaces can absorb and orient guest molecules by means of supermolecular interactions, making them broadly applicable to molecular encapsulation, among other applications.          The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analyses are commonly used to investigate the host\u2013guest interactions between the host MOC and adsorbed guest species. However, studying how the host\u2013guest complexes behave at molecular level remains a challenge, because high-quality single crystals of host MOC are required to realize guest exchange and structure analysis using conventional X-ray diffraction methods.In a study published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition, the research group led by Prof. Zhang Jian from Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, reported the post-assembly modification of homochiral titanium\u2013organic cages for recognition and separation of molecular isomers.The researchers extended and fixed the pre-synthesized chiral MOC into a porous framework, improving its crystal stability in the solid state and enabling the study of host guest behavior at the molecular level.By employing the chiral MOC as a precursor, the researchers synthesized a pair of size-tunable and homochiral Ti4L6 cage-based frameworks polynuclear titanium cage (PTC)-236(\u0394 and \u039b) using a post-assembly reaction. They constructed the three-dimensional microporous framework of PTC-236 by using \u0394\u0394\u0394\u0394- or \u039b\u039b\u039b\u039b-[Ti4L6] cages with triple-stranded left- or right-handed helical Zn-bimb chains (bimb = 4,4'-di(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl).The researchers found that PTC-236 was highly stable in air, water, and other solvents, and possessed chiral pore channels in its host framework and rich recognition sites provided by the cage moieties. These characteristics facilitated the study of PTC-236 in host\u2013guest chemistry via single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. They utilized PTC-236 for the X-ray diffraction analyses of more than 20 guests, including benzene (PhH) and its derivatives, aromatic/aliphatic nitriles, and aromatic alcohol molecules.The researchers also revealed that the material exhibited selective recognition and separation ability for spice Cinnamonitrile cis-trans isomers with up to 95% separation. They can clearly observe the host-guest interactions between the titanium cage and captured guests.This study provides a new strategy for the orderly combination of structurally well-defined MOCs into functional porous frameworks, expands the use of MOCs in solid phases, and develops a novel controlled multistage assembly system for isomer separation materials.

  "text": "A team of chemists from Aix-Marseille University, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay and Institut Polytechnique de Paris has discovered that the chlorella variabilis fatty acid photodecarboxylase (CvFAP) can be used to convert octanoic acids four times faster than hexadecanoic acids.          In their study, reported in the journal Science Advances, the group tested fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) and discovered a process to convert an 8-carbon fatty acid to a liquid hydrocarbon much faster than prior processes. Also, the editors at Nature have published a Research Highlights article outlining the work done by the team on this new effort.As climate change progresses, scientists around the world continue to look for ways to stop or reduce carbon emissions. One of the main areas of focus is the huge amounts of CO2 emitted by automobiles. Scientists would like to find a replacement for the fossil fuels with fuels that do not emit carbon dioxide. One possibility is the use of natural processes that can convert natural ingredients into cleaner fuel, such as algae conversion of fatty acids found in fats and oils into hydrocarbons.Such processes are driven by FAP, which is powered through sunlight conversion. Unfortunately, research efforts have been unsuccessful at producing large amounts of hydrocarbons that can be used as a fuel because the process typically involves deriving fatty acids that have long chains of carbon atoms. In this new effort, the research team found an autocatalytic effect that dramatically boosts the production of short carbon-atom chained hydrocarbons.In their work, the researchers tested the use of FAP in solutions containing 8-carbon atom chains of fatty acids. They found that when exposed to light, the enzyme chlorella variabilis was able to convert such chains to a liquid hydrocarbon up to four times as fast as those using 16-atom chains\u2014possibly opening the door to using CvFAP as a way to mass produce and sell a much greener type of hydrocarbon fuel.

  "text": "A team of mechanical and civil engineers working with occupational health scientists affiliated with several entities in China and two colleagues from Harvard University found high levels of a host of chemicals inside of a newly purchased SUV. In their study, reported in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science, the group analyzed air samples inside the vehicle over multiple days.          Cars, trucks and SUVs all have one thing in common: When purchased brand-new, they come with what has come to be known as that \"new car smell.\" That smell is made up of chemicals released into the air by materials used to make cars\u2014a process known as off-gassing. Prior research has suggested that some of those chemicals, such as formaldehyde, may pose a health hazard for new car drivers. In this new effort, the research team took a more serious look at the chemicals released into the air by just one vehicle\u2014a brand-new, midsize, plug-in hybrid SUV that was manufactured within one month of testing.The team parked the SUV in a local outdoor parking lot and tested the air inside of it every day for 12 consecutive days. They note that over the course of their study, environmental conditions changed, most noticeably, air temperature\u2014from 21\u00b0C to 63\u00b0C. They used gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy to identify chemicals in air sample and their concentrations.The researchers identified 20 chemicals in the air samples that had come from components used to make the vehicle. They amounts varied depending mostly on surface temperatures inside the car (not air temperatures). They found that the amounts of some chemicals, such as formaldehyde, exceeded Chinese government safety standards at some points by up to 35%. Acetaldehyde, a known carcinogen, exceeded standards by 61%. The team also found levels of benzene that they described as being unsafe for drivers breathing it for long drives.

  "text": "Thinking of CO2, terms like climate-damaging or waste product probably quickly come to mind. While CO2 has been that for a long time\u2014a pure waste product\u2014more and more processes are being developed with which the greenhouse gas can be converted into valuable raw materials. Researchers then speak of \"value-added chemicals.\" A new material that makes this possible was developed at TU Wien and recently presented in the journal Communications Chemistry.          Researchers at Prof. Dominik Eder's group developed a new material that facilitates the conversion of CO2. These are MOCHAs\u2014organometallic chalcogenolate compounds that serve as catalysts. The result of the electrochemical conversion is synthesis gas, or syngas for short, which is an important raw material for the chemical industry.CO2 becomes synthesis gasSyngas is a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2) and other gases and is used as a basic material for other substances. One of the most important fields of application is fertilizer production, in which ammonia is produced from syngas. However, it can also be used for the production of fuels such as diesel or for the production of methanol, which is used in fuel cells. Since the extraction of CO2 from the atmosphere is quite energy-intensive, taking CO2 from industrial plants is a good option. From there, it can serve as a starting material for various chemicals.However, previous methods require high temperatures and pressures as well as expensive catalysts. Therefore, the Viennese researchers were looking for catalysts that can also be used to produce syngas at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure.\"MOCHAs work differently than the catalysts used so far: Instead of heat, electricity is supplied to activate the catalyst and trigger the conversion of CO2 into synthesis gas,\" explains Junior Group Leader Dogukan Apaydin, who is responsible for research efforts towards CO2 conversion in the research group.MOCHAs as problem solversMOCHAs are a material class that was developed almost 20 years ago but has not yet found any application. The organic-inorganic hybrid materials have gained popularity again in recent years. The TU researchers recognized the potential of MOCHAs as catalysts and conducted experiments with them for the first time. However, they encountered some problems: Previous synthesis methods only yielded small amounts of product and required a lot of time. \"With the help of our synthesis method, we were able to significantly increase the amount of product and reduce the time from 72 to five hours,\" Apaydin explains.Initial tests showed that the catalytic performance of MOCHAs in the production of synthesis gas from CO2 is comparable to previously established catalysts. Moreover, they require much less energy, as the entire reaction can be carried out at room temperature. In addition, MOCHAs prove to be extremely stable. They can be used in different solvents, at different temperatures or under different pH conditions and retain their structure even after catalysis.Nevertheless, there are some parameters that the team around Dogukan Apaydin and Ph.D. student Hannah Rabl continue to research. If the same electrodes are used several times to supply energy in the form of power, there is a slight drop in performance. How the connection between MOCHAs and electrodes can be further improved to prevent this drop in performance is now being researched in long-term experiments.\"We are still at an early stage of application,\" Dogukan Apaydin admits. \"I like to compare this with solar panels, which were much more complex and expensive to produce 30 years ago than today. But with the right infrastructure and political will, MOCHAs can also be widely used in the future to convert CO2 into synthesis gas and thus make their contribution to climate protection.\" More information:Hannah Rabl et al, Microwave-assisted synthesis of metal-organic chalcogenolate assemblies as electrocatalysts for syngas production, Communications Chemistry (2023).

  "answer_squad": " burnout",
  "text": "Associate Professor Jonathan Boreyko leads a team at Virginia Tech that has built a strong portfolio of work with ice and water, exploring the possibilities for de-icing planes, building novel water harvesting devices, and creating snow globes out of bubbles. This familiarity with water has given the team a strong sense of its behavior in different states, leading to a new project that shows how ice quenches heat in comparison to water. The findings were published in the journal Chem on April 14.          Mojtaba Edalatpour and master's student Camryn Col\u00f3n carried out this project. They investigated methods of quenching heat from metal, a critical step in applications such as metallurgy and firefighting. Both instances require speed. Metallurgists need to rapidly drop the temperature of a forged piece to achieve specific material properties, while firefighters work to stop destruction of property as quickly as possible. Quenching with water is only effective beneath a critical temperature\u2014any higher and the water levitates on its own vapor and can no longer boil the heat away.Boreyko's team wanted to see if using ice, rather than water, could bypass the levitation issue to enable the quenching of ultra-hot surfaces.Measuring, heating, and measuring againTo conduct this research, Edalatpour and Col\u00f3n heated an aluminum stage and measured the cooling rate of water versus ice. To ensure a direct comparison, they released the same amount of water and ice onto the surface after it was heated to a desired temperature.When the initial surface temperature of the stage was between 100\u00b0C and 300\u00b0C, both the water and the ice successfully quenched the surface below 100\u00b0C. The ice, however, achieved that result in half the time. At higher initial temperatures\u2014300\u00b0C to 500\u00b0C\u2014only quenching with ice was successful. Heat transfer with ice was more than 100 times more effective than with liquid water at these high temperatures.What was the difference? The properties of water prevent it from hitting the sweet spot for removing heat.That sweet spot is boiling, because the steam escaping in bubbles most efficiently carries the heat away. Because water easily levitates on its vapor at high temperatures, it becomes insulated from the surface and the boiling never occurs. Ice behaves differently. When dropped onto a hot surface, ice absorbs much of the heat as it melts. This reduces the amount of heat available for producing vapor bubbles, preventing the levitation problem. In other words, the meltwater boils at a slower pace compared to pure water, thus helping to maintain boiling at high temperatures.Boreyko compared the unusual liquid behavior with worker productivity.\"Think about a workaholic who is always focusing on their job,\" he said. \"They start off hyper-productive but quickly burn out and become ineffective. It turns out that water is the same way when exposed to ultra-high temperature surfaces: It is so focused and productive at boiling water into vapor that it experiences 'burnout,' which is the scientific term for levitation and the catastrophic failure in cooling that results. So ice is like the slow and steady tortoise that wins in the long run. It doesn't make vapor bubbles very well, but this allows it to keep boiling and avoid levitation when things get heated.\"      The frozen path continuesThe group's hypothesis of using ice for quenching followed its recent discovery that ice does not levitate and lose its boiling capability until 550\u00b0C, compared to 150\u00b0C for water. Based on those findings, Boreyko's team began several new projects applying its principles. This heat transfer is the first outgrowth to be published.Col\u00f3n's follow-up work includes measuring the cooling performance of ice when the surface is fixed at a constant temperature rather than being allowed to cool down.\"When you have a constant temperature, you can measure the steady-state heat flux, which would allow us to directly compare the heat transfer of ice versus state-of-the-art boilers,\" said Col\u00f3n.The team is also brainstorming how to implement a practical ice quenching system.\"It remains to be seen exactly how to implement three-phase heat transfer for real life applications, but we're excited to figure it out over the next several years,\" said Boreyko. \"It might involve making spray nozzles that are able to eject ice particles instead of water, or perhaps it will look more like releasing a pre-formed block of ice onto an overheated surface. There's a lot more to figure out before this becomes an on-the-shelf technology.\" More information:Jonathan R.

  "text": "Scientists have discovered yet another amazing aspect of the weird and wonderful behavior of water\u2014this time when subjected to nanoscale confinement at sub-zero temperatures.          The finding that a crystalline substance can readily give up water at temperatures as low as -70 \u00b0C, published in the journal Nature on April 12, has major implications for the development of materials designed to extract water from the atmosphere.A team of supramolecular chemists at Stellenbosch University (SU), consisting of Dr. Alan Eaby, Prof. Catharine Esterhuysen and Prof. Len Barbour, made this discovery while trying to understand the peculiar behavior of a type of crystal that first piqued their interest about ten years ago.\"Scientists are currently adept at designing materials that can absorb water,\" Barbour explains. \"However, it is much harder to get those materials (we call them 'hydrates') to then release the water without having to supply energy in the form of heat. As we all know, energy is expensive and seldom completely 'green.'\"The chemical compound in question was originally synthesized by Prof. Marcin Kwit, a specialist in organic stereochemistry at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland. It was then crystallized and brought to Barbour's lab for further study by postdoctoral fellow Dr. Agnieszka Janiak. This was mainly because of Barbour's interest in ring-shaped molecules and how they form channels when packed together in crystals.VT-SCXRD perspective view along [210] showing the evolution of difference electron density in T1-R during cooling from \u221230 to \u2212125 \u00b0C. Host molecules in the foreground have been omitted for clarity. Credit: Nature (2023). DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-05749-7Janiak noticed that the crystals were yellow on some days and red on others. It didn't take her long to figure out that the crystals would only turn red on days with humidity levels higher than 55%. When humidity levels fell below this level, the crystals would go back to being yellow.\"Not only was this behavior rather unusual,\" Barbour explains, \"it was also happening very fast. It seems the crystals were absorbing water as fast at high humidity as it was losing it again at low humidity. While we are familiar with materials designed to absorb water, it is highly unusual for a material that absorbs water easily to lose it equally easily.\"Why do these crystals have such special properties? This question started a nearly ten-year investigation, which initially focused on explaining the mechanism behind the color change. Theoretical modeling by Esterhuysen and MSc student Dirkie Myburgh showed that water uptake causes slight changes in the electronic properties of the crystals, causing them to turn red. With such remarkable properties, Barbour was convinced that the crystals would also have other interesting properties.      That is when Ph.D. student Alan Eaby started dabbling with the material. Initially he had focused on room temperature studies for his MSc research but would later turn his attention to measuring properties at lower temperatures when he embarked on his Ph.D. three years ago. He wanted to know how the crystals would behave when subjected to different temperatures and humidity levels: \"I was intrigued by the color change and wanted to explore what was happening at the atomic scale,\" he explains.Having learned about developing instruments and methods from Barbour, he embarked on employing non-standard techniques to understand the mechanisms of water uptake and release in the material.One day, he observed something strange happening at temperatures below zero degrees Celsius. \"I noticed that the crystal still changed color at sub-zero temperatures. Initially I thought that there was something wrong with the experimental setup or the temperature controller, as crystal hydrates are not supposed to release water at such low temperatures,\" he explains.After lots of conversations and coffee breaks with Barbour and Esterhuysen, and tweaking the experimental setup several times, they realized that Alan's observations could be explained by the narrowness of the channels in the material. The channels in the crystal are only one nanometer wide\u2014one thousandth the diameter of a human hair.It was already known that, at the nanoscale, water can remain mobile within channels at temperatures below 0\u00b0C. However, this study showed for the first time that such channels can also allow the uptake and release of water at temperatures far below its normal freezing point.To understand this process, Eaby undertook an extensive, systematic series of X-ray diffraction studies of the red and yellow crystals at different temperatures and humidities. This allowed him to construct a computer-generated \"movie,\" with atomic-scale resolution, of what happens to the channels upon cooling or heating, and in the presence or absence of water. These animations indicated that water molecules in the nanochannels move about freely until cooled to -70 \u00b0C, whereupon they undergo a \"reversible structuring event\" to resemble a glassy state. This \"glass transition\" ultimately causes the water to become trapped in the material at temperatures below -70\u00b0C.Were it not for the color-changing behavior of the crystals in the first place, they would not have become aware of the ultralow temperature water loss capability. \"Who knows,\" says Barbour, \"there may be many other materials out there with the ability to absorb and release water at very low temperatures, such as metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks.\"We simply do not know about it because we have not been able to visualize it. Now that we do know that such behavior is possible, it opens a whole new field of research and potential applications. Researchers can use this new information to identify other materials with similar properties, and also use the principles we've developed to fine tune the low-temperatures release of water. This could lead to dramatic reductions in the energetic costs of atmospheric water harvesting, with implications for society and the environment,\" he concludes. More information:Alan C.

  "text": "The increasing CO2 emission as the chief culprit causing many environmental problems could be addressed via electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to the added-value carbon-based chemicals. Due to the unique advantages, ionic liquids (ILs) have been widely studied to promote CO2R as electrolytes and co-catalysts.          Among the potential products of CO2R, those only containing one carbon atom, named C1 products, including CO, CH3OH, CH4, and syngas, are easier to achieve than others. In the last dozen years, numerous related experimental studies and reviews have been reported to promote the development of CO2R-to-C1 products, and rapid progress has been achieved in these recent years.However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has been conducted to discuss and systematically compare the economic benefits of different C1 products (CO, CH3OH, CH4, H2/CO(1:1) and H2/CO(2:1)) focusing on the IL-based electrolyte systems, as well as analyzing environmental impacts, to give guidance for realizing the commercialization of CO2R technology in the near future.Herein, a team of scientists summarized and updated the research progress in the CO2R-to-C1 products based on the IL-based electrolytes, and comprehensively evaluated the economic benefit and environmental influence for the state-of-the-art and future potential technologies, respectively. Their work was published in Industrial Chemistry & Materials.\"As the rapid development of CO2R with ILs-based electrolyte in the lab, it is necessary to have a clear insight on their commercial value when scale-up it to an industrial scale,\" said Xiaoyan Ji, a professor at Lule\u00e5 University of Technology.\"In this review, we summarized the experimental achievements of CO2R-to-C1 products using IL-based electrolyte, evaluated their performances from both economic and environmental aspects based the state-of-the-art technology and those with improved performance in the near future, and identified their potential for commercialization. We also put forward the strategies to boost the performance and profits for CO2R-to-C1 product with ILs as the electrolyte in the future.\"CO2R is one of the most promising methods to realize the conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals because of its mild conditions, as well as its easy and flexible controllability. Besides, its driving force can be integrated with renewable sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower.      There are three main parameters to evaluate the performance of CO2R, including current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and cell voltage, which can be improved through designing and optimizing electrocatalysts and electrolytes.ILs, with their tunable structures and properties, wide electrochemical windows, and high electrical conductivities, can provide a low overpotential and high current density, and improve the product selectivity for CO2R. Significantly, ILs can effectively inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is a competitive reaction of CO2R.\"CO is the only profitable product among the studied C1 products, while the total production costs (TPC) of other products are too high to be profitable, especially for CH4 and H2/CO(2:1),\" Ji said.\"This phenomenon is consistent with the performance of CO2R for each product. The current density and FE of CO are as high as 182.2 mA cm-2 and 99.7%, respectively. However, for CH4 and H2/CO(2:1), the current densities are as low as 25.6 and 11.4 mA cm-2, respectively. Additionally, with the improved performance of CO2R, CH3OH and H2/CO(1:1) can be profitable in the near future. While it is difficult for CH4 and H2/CO(2:1) to be profitable even under the most ideal scenario, partly due to the low market price. On the other side, the formation of CH4 requires transferring the largest number of electrons (8e-) among the studied C1 products.\"\"CO2R-to-CH4 is the most environmentally friendly pathway compared to others,\" added Xiangping Zhang, a professor at the Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. \"While, considering both economic and environmental aspects, CO is the most attractive product. For other C1 products, further improvement of CO2R or the development of more advanced electrolyzers are required to realize their commercial value,\" Zhang said.Furthermore, ILs should be further exploited in the future CO2R as follows: (1) the adjustable feature of ILs in the structure and properties provides unique advantages and feasibilities for designing more efficient and suitable electrolytes of CO2R; (2) the capability of ILs to dissolve a variety of solvents and electrolytes can integrate other solvents and electrolytes, further improving the performance of CO2R; (3) the cleaner ILs can be designed and synthesized applying into CO2R to mitigate the environmental burden; (4) except as electrolytes, ILs can also be the co-catalyst or modifier for the catalyst exhibiting superior performance.\"In this review, our main goal is to provide readers with intuitionistic insight on the commercial potential of CO2R-to-C1 products with ILs as the electrolyte based on the state-of-the-art and future scenarios from both economic and environmental aspects,\" said Ji.

  "text": "Two prominent origin-of-life chemists have published a new hypothesis for how the first sugars\u2014which were necessary for life to evolve\u2014arose on the early Earth.          In a paper published on April 13, 2023, in the journal Chem, chemists from Scripps Research and the Georgia Institute of Technology propose that key sugars needed for making early life forms could have emerged from reactions involving glyoxylate (C2HO3\u2013), a relatively simple chemical that plausibly existed on the Earth before life evolved. The study is titled \"The Potential of Glyoxylate as a Prebiotic Source Molecule and a Reactant in Protometabolic Pathways\u2014The Glyoxylose Reaction.\"\"We show that our new hypothesis has key advantages over the more traditional view that early sugars arose from the chemical formaldehyde,\" says Ramanarayanan Krishnamurthy, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Chemistry at Scripps Research. Krishnamurthy's co-author was Charles Liotta, Ph.D., Regents' Professor Emeritus at the Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Chemistry and Biochemistry.Origin-of-life chemists seek to explain how the basic molecular building blocks and reactions necessary for life could have arisen from the simple chemicals that were likely present on the \"prebiotic\" Earth. The overarching aim of the field is to answer the fundamental question of how our living planet came to be. But its discoveries also can inform\u2014and have informed\u2014many other fields, from atmospheric science and geology to synthetic biology and the search for life on other planets.The three major classes of biological molecule whose availability needs to be explained by origin-of-life chemistry are: the amino acids that make up proteins, the nucleobases that make up the \"letters\" of DNA and RNA, and the sugars (also called carbohydrates) that are found throughout biology, including in the twisted backbone structure of DNA and RNA. According to the prevailing theories, amino acids probably arose from ammonia (NH3), while nucleobases arose from hydrogen cyanide (HCN).The origin of sugars has been less clear. Many scientists believe the first sugars came from reactions involving formaldehyde (CH2O), but this theory has some drawbacks.\"The formaldehyde reactions proposed by this theory are quite messy\u2014they have uncontrolled side reactions and other drawbacks due to formaldehyde's high reactivity under the envisioned early-Earth conditions,\" Liotta says.The chemists' proposed alternative is a \"glyoxylose reaction\" scenario in which glyoxylate first reacts with itself, forming a close cousin of formaldehyde known as glycolaldehyde. The researchers suggest that glyoxylate, glycolaldehyde, their byproducts and other simple compounds could have continued to react with one another, ultimately yielding simple sugars and other products\u2014without the drawbacks of formaldehyde-based reactions.Glyoxylate already has a prominent role in origin-of-life chemistry theories. Swiss chemist Albert Eschenmoser proposed in 2007 that a form of it might have been the source for multiple original biomolecules. Krishnamurthy and Furman University chemist Greg Springsteen, Ph.D., also suggested in a 2020 Nature Chemistry paper that glyoxylate could have helped initiate a primordial version of the modern (tricarboxylic acid) TCA cycle, a basic metabolic process found in most life forms on Earth.Krishnamurthy and his team are currently working to demonstrate in the laboratory that the glyoxylose reaction scenario could indeed have yielded the first sugars.\"Such a demonstration would expand the role of glyoxylate as a versatile molecule in prebiotic chemistry and further stimulate the search for its own origin on the prebiotic Earth,\" Krishnamurthy says.The chemists are also looking into potential commercial applications of reactions that make glyoxylate, since these effectively consume CO2 and thus can be used to reduce CO2 levels, either locally in industrial settings or globally to combat global warming.

  "text": "Low-methoxy (LM) pectin gels have gained momentum in tissue engineering and drug delivery in recent years due to their excellent biocompatibility. LM pectin forms stable hydrogels by forming supramolecular assemblies with egg-box structures in the presence of divalent ions like Ca2+, generally provided by a calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution or calcium carbonate (CaCO3). In particular, the use of CaCO3 enables the preparation of LM pectin gels with controlled shape.          Previous research has shown that minute changes in hydrogel synthesis precursor parameters can majorly impact the hydrogel properties and their applications. For instance, decreasing the pH or acidifying the precursor accelerates the gelation rate and increases the mechanical strength of LM pectin hydrogels. CO2 is a popular acidic agent because it can decrease pH and be easily removed from the system after gelation.However, despite CO2 being a promising acidic agent, a precise understanding of its effects on hydrogel synthesis and properties is poorly understood.A group of scientists from Japan, led by Mr. Ryota Teshima, a Master's student from Tokyo University of Science (TUS), decided to fill this gap. To do so, they prepared LM pectin/CaCO3 hydrogels using the standard method and under controlled thermodynamic conditions with carbonated water as the source of CO2.The research team also included Dr. Shigehito Osawa (currently at Tokyo Women's Medical University), and Dr. Yayoi Kawano, Prof. Takehisa Hanawa, Prof. Akihiko Kikuchi, and Prof. Hidenori Otsuka from TUS. Their research was published in ACS Omega.Explaining the reasoning behind this approach, Mr. Teshima says, \"We chose carbonated water as the acidic agent for gelation because conventional methods would require high-pressure conditions to ensure proper supply of CO2 to the hydrogel precursor. Instead, using carbonated water allowed us to supply carbonate ions and CO2 to the hydrogel mixture and trigger gelation under ambient pressure and temperature conditions.\"The team simultaneously prepared two LM pectin/CaCO3 hydrogels\u2014one with added carbonated water and the other without. They observed that the one with carbonated water underwent faster gelation and showed increased mechanical strength compared to the one without.These improvements could arise from the lower pH of carbonated water enhancing the solubility of CaCO3, which further increases the availability of free Ca2+ ions. More Ca2+ means better cross-linking between pectin polymers, quicker gelation, and more robust hydrogels.After the hydrogel formation, carbonated water/CO2 was volatilized from the surface in contact with the atmosphere. The team found that post-CO2 escape, the pH of the final hydrogel was higher than the hydrogel prepared without carbonated water. The team suggested this could be because many carboxy groups were consumed during cross-linking. with Ca2+ and the acidic component, CO2, was completely volatilized from the hydrogels after gelation.The team further prepared aerogels by freeze-drying the hydrogels. They found highly ordered networks of elongated porosity in those prepared through the carbonated water route, suggesting that the CO2 from carbonated water could induce intrinsic structural changes in the hydrogels.The researchers also prepared hydrogels with different amounts of CO2 in the carbonated water to demonstrate that the pH and strength of LM pectin hydrogels can be tuned in this manner. The insights from this study can prove helpful when fabricating functional hydrogels with tailored properties.This research contributes to the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs), as the LM pectin was primarily derived from food waste, such as apple and citrus fruits. \"Every year, 2.5 billion tons of food is wasted worldwide, which includes vegetables and fruits that are discarded without ever reaching the market because of quality issues. We believe that the promising results of our study will encourage other researchers to use items thrown out as food waste as raw materials for their scientific ventures,\" concludes Mr. Teshima.

  "answer_squad": " water",
  "text": "There is a need for new drugs. For example, many of the antibiotics that we have been using for a long time are becoming less effective. Chemists and pharmaceutical scientists are frantically searching for new active substances, especially those that can penetrate cell membranes, as these are the only ones that patients can take orally in the form of a tablet or syrup.          Only active ingredients pass through the intestinal wall in the small intestine and enter the bloodstream to reach the affected area in the body. For active ingredients that cannot penetrate the cell membrane, physicians have no choice but to inject them directly into the bloodstream.Large molecules with potentialThat is why researchers are trying to understand which molecules can penetrate cell membranes and how exactly they do this. For one important and promising class of substances\u2014cyclic peptides\u2014chemists at ETH Zurich have now decoded additional details of the relevant mechanism. \"The more we know about this mechanism and the properties a molecule must have, the earlier and more effectively researchers can take this into account when developing new drugs,\" says Sereina Riniker, a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences. She led the study, which has now been published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.Cyclic peptides are ring-shaped molecules that are much larger than the small molecules that make up the majority of today's drugs. In some areas of application, however, chemists and pharmaceutical scientists are coming up against their limits with small molecules, which is why they are turning to larger molecules like the cyclic peptides. This substance class includes many pharmaceutically active natural substances, such as cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant that for decades has been used after organ transplants, and many antibiotics.Possible only with computer modelingUsing computer modeling and a lot of supercomputer power, Riniker and her colleagues were able to elucidate how cyclic peptides similar to cyclosporine cross a membrane. \"Only modeling allows us such detailed, high-resolution insights, as there are no experiments that would let us observe an individual molecule crossing a membrane,\" Riniker says.To understand the mechanism, one must know how cyclic peptides are structured: they consist of a central ring structure to which side chains are attached. The molecules are flexible and can dynamically change their structure to adapt to their environment.      Dance through the cell membraneRiniker's simulations reveal in detail how a cyclic peptide penetrates the membrane: First, the molecule anchor itself to the membrane's surface, before penetrating it perpendicular to the membrane. It then changes its three-dimensional shape while passing through, rotating once about its longitudinal axis before reaching the other side of the membrane, where it exits again.These changes in shape have to do with the different environments the molecule experiences as it moves through the membrane: The body consists largely of water. Both inside and outside of cells, biochemical molecules are mostly present in aqueous solution. Cell membranes, on the other hand, are made up of fatty acids, so water-repellent conditions prevail within them. \"To enable it to cross the membrane, the cyclic peptide changes its three-dimensional shape to briefly become as hydrophobic as possible,\" Riniker explains.Changing molecular side chainsFor the present study, the researchers investigated eight different cyclic peptides. These are model peptides with no medicinal effect\u2014scientists at pharmaceutical giant Novartis developed them for basic research, which is why Riniker also collaborated with Novartis researchers for this study.The new findings can now be used in discovering cyclic peptides as new drug candidates. However, Riniker points out a certain trade-off: there are side chains that provide ideal conditions for cyclic peptides to anchor to the membrane surface, but that make it difficult for the peptides to cross the membrane. This new knowledge helps researchers to give advance thought to which side chains they want to use and where on the molecule they are most helpful.All of this could speed up drug discovery and development by ensuring right from the outset that researchers are investigating potential active ingredients that can eventually be taken as a tablet.

  "text": "Fermented foods like kimchi have been an integral part of Korean cuisine for thousands of years. Since ancient times, Korean chefs have used onggi\u2014traditional handmade clay jars\u2014to ferment kimchi. Today, most kimchi is made through mass fermentation in glass, steel, or plastic containers, but it has long been claimed that the highest quality kimchi is fermented in onggi.          Kimchi purists now have scientific validation, thanks to recent research from David Hu, professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech, and Soohwan Kim, a second-year Ph.D. student in Hu's lab.In a combined experimental and theoretical study, Hu and Kim measured carbon dioxide levels in onggi during kimchi fermentation and developed a mathematical model to show how the gas was generated and moved through the onggi's porous walls. By bringing the study of fluid mechanics to bear on an ancient technology, their research highlights the work of artisans and provides the missing link for how the traditional earthenware allows for high quality kimchi.Their research was published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.\"We wanted to find the 'secret sauce' for how onggi make kimchi taste so good,\" Hu said. \"So, we measured how the gases evolved while kimchi fermented inside the onggi\u2014something no one had done before.\"The porous structure of these earthenware vessels mimics the loose soil where lactic acid bacteria\u2014known for their healthy probiotic nature\u2014are found. While previous studies have shown that kimchi fermented in onggi has more lactic acid bacteria, no one knew exactly how the phenomenon is connected to the unique material properties of the container.First, Kim obtained a traditional, handmade onggi jar from an artisan in his hometown in Jeju, South Korea, a region famous for onggi. Back at Georgia Tech, Hu and Kim first tested the permeability of the onggi by observing how water evaporated through the container over time.Next, they installed carbon dioxide and pressure sensors into both the onggi and a typical, hermetically sealed glass jar. They prepared their own salted cabbage and placed it in both containers. They then used the sensors to measure and compare the change in carbon dioxide\u2014a signature of fermentation.Hu and Kim also developed a mathematical model based on the porosity of the onggi. The model allowed them to infer the generation rate of carbon dioxide, since the onggi lets carbon dioxide out gradually.      They concluded that the onggi's porous walls permitted the carbon dioxide to escape the container, which accelerated the speed of fermentation. The onggi's porosity also functioned as a \"safety valve,\" resulting in a slower increase in carbon dioxide levels than the glass jar while blocking the entry of external particles. Their data revealed that the carbon dioxide level in onggi was less than half of that in glass containers.                A cross-sectional view of onggi showing fermenting cabbage. Credit: Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism             They also found that the beneficial bacteria in the onggi-made kimchi proliferated 26% more than in the glass counterpart. In the glass jar, the lactic acid bacteria became suffocated by their own carbon dioxide in the closed glass container. It turns out that because the onggi releases carbon dioxide in small rates, the lactic acid bacteria are happier and reproduce more.\"Onggi were designed without modern knowledge of chemistry, microbiology, or fluid mechanics, but they work remarkably well,\" Kim said. \"It's very interesting to get these new insights into ancient technology through the lens of fluid dynamics.\"Onggi's semiporous nature is unique compared to other forms of earthenware. A clay container that leaks, but only slightly, is not easy to make. Terra cotta containers, for example, quickly leak water.\"It's amazing that for thousands of years, people have been building these special containers out of dirt, but in many ways, they are very high tech,\" Hu said. \"We discovered that the right amount of porosity enables kimchi to ferment faster, and these onggi provide that.\"Kim said that some artisans still use ancient methods when making onggi, but their numbers are decreasing. Now, the market is flooded with inauthentic versions of the vessels.\"We hope this study draws attention to this traditional artisan work and inspires energy-efficient methods for fermenting and storing foods,\" he said. \"Also, the onggi are quite beautiful.\" More information:Soohwan Kim et al, Onggi's permeability to carbon dioxide accelerates kimchi fermentation, Journal of The Royal Society Interface (2023).

  "text": "Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a useful technique that has been widely utilized in our lives, ranging from reconstructive plastic surgery to artificial organ production. However, many biopolymers, such as nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and proteins, cannot be readily constructed into a desired 3D shape at the submicron- or nanoscale due to their inherent rheological and structural properties. Can we truly achieve the free-form and high-resolution structuring of various biomolecules using 3D printing technology?          A team of researchers from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at POSTECH led by Professor Seung Soo Oh, Professor Emeritus Jung Ho Je, Dr. Moon-Jung Yong, and Ph.D. candidates Un Yang and Byunghwa Kang has developed a groundbreaking 3D printing technology that directly allows precise writing and patterning of various biopolymers with full mechanical stability and functional integrity.Their findings have been published in Advanced Science.The research team has presented a novel 3D printing strategy that preserves the folding structure and molecular function of various biopolymers by sequentially confining, evaporating, and solidifying a biopolymer-containing solution.Irrespective of biopolymer types, this technique can produce 3D biopolymeric architectures with precisely-controlled size and geometry at submicron resolution.Furthermore, it allows the printed biopolymers to exhibit their own desired functions, thereby achieving pin-point localization of spatiotemporal biofunctions, including molecular recognition and catalytic reactions.                3D nanopatterns of biopolymers. The new printing technology allows for precise construction of 3D patterns using various biopolymers such as nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and proteins in the form of pillar and arch-shaped nanowires. Credit: POSTECH             This 3D printing technique can be applied in various fields by utilizing the principle that at molecular levels, the evaporation and solidification of pure biopolymer-containing solution occurs regardless of the biopolymer type. It is also highly advantageous that this printing process does not cause any damage or deformation to the biopolymers, due to a mild processing environment under room temperature and ambient air without any additives.This breakthrough is expected to have wide-ranging applications in the development of materials that can analyze and mimic microscale biological tissues. It can be also applicable to manufacture artificial cells and tissues that can function properly in a biological environment, as well as to produce biochips. The researchers now plan to develop next-generation cell-mimicking device printing methods for practical diagnostics and drug development.\"The significance of this research lies in proving for the first time the possibility of printing 100% functionally and structurally active biopolymers in ultrafine 3D structures,\" emphasized Professor Seung Soo Oh, the POSTECH team leader.

  "text": "Epoxy resin monomers used in industry can result in severe contact allergies. Researchers at the University of Gothenburg have now developed a new type of epoxy resin monomer that is far less allergenic and is based on a renewable material. The epoxy resin monomers used today contain residues of the endocrine disruptor Bisphenol A (BPA). The new monomer derived from ordinary sugar is not based on BPA.          Epoxy resin monomers have been used for a long time in the construction industry and, more recently, in the production of the plastics used in wind turbines. The monomer is produced from BPA, which is derived from petroleum. The risk of developing a contact allergy when handling epoxy resin monomers is considerable, and sometimes it is not even enough to wear protective clothing.\"When we started our research, we had three goals. The monomer should be far less allergenic, be based on an easily accessible and renewable starting material, and not based on BPA, which is a known endocrine disruptor,\" says Kristina Luthman, Professor of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Gothenburg.Hazardous residues remain in the polymerEpoxy resin polymers are formed by allowing two substances to react with each other. One of these substances, called DGEBA (Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether), is reactive and helps to produce durable and cured plastics. But even after curing, the epoxy resin polymer still has residues of the contact allergenic DGEBA and the endocrine disruptor BPA, both of which entail health risks.Researchers at the University of Gothenburg have now developed a new epoxy resin monomer based on isosorbide, which is a substance produced from glucose\u2014in other words, ordinary sugar. Those who handle the epoxy resin monomers will gain most from this research.\"If the monomer is less allergenic, this is of great practical importance. It may then be enough to wear protective clothing, which is not always the case today,\" says Kristina Luthman.Cheap input materialAnother advantage of the new material is that it is made from a renewable starting material (sugar beet), and not fossil oil as is the case with today's epoxy resin monomers.The next step will be to test the monomer produced and see if it has the right properties for use as a substitute for today's epoxy resin monomers in industrial applications. As it is derived from sugar, the material is cheap.\"Usability and cost-effectiveness will be questions for the plastics industry to address. One obstacle is that BPA is cheap and useful for creating plastics with a variety of properties. So it may be difficult to convince industry to make the switch. But if the use of BPA is regulated more strictly within the EU, that will put the matter in a whole different light,\" says Kristina Luthman.The study is published in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology.

  "text": "Single-use hard plastics are pervasive: utensils, party decorations and food containers, to name a few examples. These items pile up in landfills, and many biodegradable versions stick around for months, requiring industrial composting systems to fully degrade. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering have created a sturdy, lightweight material that disintegrates on-demand\u2014and they made it from sugar and wood-derived powders.       Sturdy, degradable materials made from plants and other non-petroleum sources have come a long way in recent years. For example, cornstarch-based packing peanuts disappear simply by dousing them in water, and some utensils are based on polymers synthesized from plant sugars.But those packing peanuts can't be used to protect anything wet, and plant-derived polymers still take a long time to break down. One potential alternative is a new type of rigid material designed from isomalt, which is a sugar alcohol rather than a polymer. With isomalt, bakers can create breathtaking, but brittle, structures for desserts, and then dissolve them away quickly in water. So, Scott Phillips and colleagues wanted to boost the sturdiness of isomalt with natural additives to create a robust material that degrades on-demand.The researchers heated isomalt to a liquid-like state and mixed in either cellulose, cellulose and sawdust, or wood flour to produce three different materials. Then, using commercial plastics manufacturing equipment, the materials were extruded into small pellets and molded into various objects, including balls, a dodecahedron, a chess piece and flower-shaped saucers.All of the tested additives doubled the strength of isomalt, creating materials that were harder than plastics, including poly(ethylene terephthalate) (known as PET) and poly(vinyl chloride) (known as PVC), but were still lightweight. In experiments, samples dissolved in water within minutes.And saucers made of the material, and coated with a food grade shellac and cellulose acetate, withstood being immersed in water for up to seven days. However, once the saucers were broken and the coating cracked, they rapidly disintegrated in water. The team also repeatedly crushed, dissolved and recycled both coated and uncoated objects into new ones that were still as strong as the original items.The researchers say that the material could be used for food-service items and temporary d\u00e9cor, and then crushed and sprayed with water to fall apart. But even if such items were simply tossed into the trash or somehow got into the environment, the slightest crack in the coating would start their collapse into sugars and the plant-based additives, which the researchers say might be good for soil.

  "text": "Yin-Yang theory is an ancient Chinese philosophy in which Yin-Yang forces are interdependent and work in opposition to each other to create balance.          Recently, inspired by this ancient theory, a research team led by Prof. Guo Xin and Prof. Li Can from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has revealed the origin of the stability of Dion\u2013Jacobson (DJ) phase two-dimensional (2D) perovskite materials.Their findings were published in Joule.DJ 2D perovskites, a class of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, have been widely used for various optoelectronic applications.Compared to traditional 3D perovskites with intrinsically low stability, 2D perovskites including the Ruddlesden\u2013Popper (RP) phase and DJ phase are more attractive due to their enhanced stability, especially DJ 2D perovskites based on organic diammonium cations and inorganic lead iodide octahedra, which have higher structural stability than RP ones.However, some of DJ 2D perovskites are not robust and even more easily degraded than RP 2D counterparts, which has led to a controversy over their stability. These contradictory research results have impelled scientists to clearly elucidate the stability mechanism of DJ 2D perovskites with different diammonium cations.In this study, the researchers demonstrated that the stability of DJ 2D perovskites was determined by the rigidity of organic diammonium cations, which could induce co-adaptation of organic and inorganic components to stabilize the 2D structure. Specifically, the medium cation rigidity allowed for organic diammoniums and inorganic octahedra to regulate their geometries in mutual accommodation in order to reach a stabilized state.This mechanism may provide guidance for researchers who want to consciously manipulate the stability of DJ 2D perovskites by adjusting cation rigidity.\"Similar to the two parties in the Yin-Yang theory, organic cations and inorganic octahedra in DJ 2D perovskites are interconnected with alternating hydrogen bonds and when both parts can adjust their geometries to adapt to each other, strong connections are desirable,\" said Prof. Guo. \"In this way, organic cations with moderate rigidity would play a critical role in the process of intercoordination because they have a certain degree of freedom to regulate the geometry and the inorganic part can correspondingly change its configuration as well.\" More information:Yang Liu et al, Revealing stability origin of Dion-Jacobson 2D perovskites with different-rigidity organic cations, Joule (2023).

  "text": "Whether wriggling your toes or lifting groceries, muscles in your body smoothly expand and contract. Some polymers can do the same thing\u2014acting like artificial muscles\u2014but only when stimulated by dangerously high voltages. Now, researchers in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces report a series of thin, elastic films that respond to substantially lower electrical charges. The materials represent a step toward artificial muscles that could someday operate safely in medical devices.          Artificial muscles could become key components of movable soft robotic implants and functional artificial organs. Electroactive elastomers, such as bottlebrush polymers, are attractive materials for this purpose because they start soft but stiffen when stretched. And they can change shape when electrically charged. However, currently available bottlebrush polymer films only move at voltages more than 4,000 V, which exceeds the 50 V maximum that the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration states is safe.Reducing the thickness of these films to less than 100 \u00b5m could lower the required voltages, but this hasn't been done successfully yet for bottlebrush polymers. So, Dorina Opris and colleagues wanted to find a simple way to produce thinner films.The researchers synthesized a suite of bottlebrush polymers by reacting norbornene-grafted polydimethylsiloxane macromonomers and cross-linking the products by ultraviolet light. A 60-\u00b5m-thick material was the most electroactive, expanding more than previously reported elastomers, with an operating voltage of 1,000 V. And a circular actuator made out of that material expanded and contracted more than 10,000 times before degrading.In another set of experiments, the researchers introduced polar side chains to the polymers and produced materials that responded to voltages as low as 800 V. However, they didn't expand as much as the team's most electroactive film. Based on the results, the researchers say that, with some tweaks, the material could someday be used to develop durable implants and other medical devices that work at safer voltages.

  "answer_squad": " Kolbe electrolysis",
  "text": "A team of chemists from Scripps Research and Abbvie Process Research and Development has found that making a couple of minor changes to Kolbe coupling allows for easily making high-cost materials out of low-cost materials or even waste products. Their study is reported in the journal Science. Peng Guo and Ke-Yin Ye, both with Fuzhou University, in China, have published a Perspective piece in the same journal issue outlining the work by the team on this this effort.          Kolbe coupling was first described by Michael Faraday back in 1834, but it was not well known until Hermann Kolbe used it in 1849 to couple pairs of molecules in a substance containing a carboxylic acid. Thus, it bears his name. It is currently considered to be one of the oldest known reactions in organic chemistry.The reaction occurs when a platinum electrode is inserted into the mix and electricity applied. Thus, the reaction is sometimes referred to as Kolbe electrolysis. It also results in the release of carbon dioxide. But the reaction usually has other unfortunate outcomes, as well, such as oxidizing other materials in the mix, which is why it is rarely used. In this new effort, the research team was studying decarboxylation for another project when they found they had made adjustments to Kolbe coupling, and found that doing so provided unexpected benefits.In their work, the researchers had been using rapid alternating polarity (rAP) in their work, which they applied to the new effort. Also, instead of using platinum electrodes, they were using electrodes that were carbon-based. They noted that because they were using rAP, oxidizing of functional groups was avoided.Intrigued by their finding, the team conduced Kolbe coupling experiments with the two adjustments. They bought a bottle of castor oil and used it to make 10-undecenoic acid. They then inserted an electrode and conducted rAP. The ensuing reaction produced 1,19-eicosadiene, a material that typically costs approximately $10,000 per gram.Next, the group produced diol, which they mixed with a diketone to create a degradable ketal-polymer. They suggest that it could also be used to convert side-chain carboxylic acids to other products or perhaps to convert succinic acid esters into adipic acid esters.

  "text": "A research team led by Professor Hongzhe Sun from the Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, The University of Hong Kong, has published a paper titled \"Mitochondrial ATP synthase as a direct molecular target of chromium(III) to ameliorate hyperglycaemia stress\" in Nature Communications.          The researchers found that, chromium(III) (Cr(III)), a nutritional supplement, can enhance cells' ability to metabolize glucose by regulating ATP synthase activity. This process improves mitochondrial deformation caused by high glucose levels and significantly boosts glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetic mice.To uncover the protein targets of Cr(III) and elucidate the molecular mechanism, the team developed a fluorescent probe for detecting transient metal-protein interactions, achieving a high spatiotemporal resolution tracking of the Cr(III) proteome in HepG2 cells. This led to the identification of Cr(III)-binding proteins within cells.The team then revealed that Cr(III) replaces magnesium ions (Mg2+) in ATP synthase, reduces ATP synthase activity, and activates the downstream AMPK pathway, resulting in improved glucose metabolism. This study provides a novel concept for hypoglycemic research.\"Although Cr(III) compounds have long been used as a nutritional supplement for diabetes treatment, weight loss and muscle development, its protein target and mechanism of action remain concealed for over half a century. We used a novel fluorescent probe, along with other chemical biology approaches, to uncover the long-standing scientific problem of the biological chemistry of Cr(III) and discovered that Cr(III) targets ATP synthase to regulate glucose,\" said Professor Sun.Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disease with over 500 million patients worldwide, cause nearly 2 million direct deaths each year. Over 95% of diabetic patients suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which poses a serious threat to human health. The effect of Cr(III) on anti-type 2 diabetes has been extensively studied in animal models. Since the initial discovery that Cr(III) supplementation in rat diets increased blood sugar removal rates, Cr(III) has been widely used in nutritional supplements for diabetes treatment, weight loss and muscle development. In fact, it is the second best-selling supplement in U.S., just after the mineral calcium.Despite its significance in food and nutritional science, chromium remains one of the least understood transition metals in the periodic table. For more than half a century, the importance, pharmacological properties, and mechanisms of action of Cr(III) in human physiology have been debated. The originally conceived low-molecular-weight chromium(III)-binding peptide (chromodulin) has never been reproducibly identified. Cr(III) is widely believed to improve glucose metabolism, maintain normal blood sugar levels, regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and enhance insulin signaling.However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown, and the bottleneck in uncovering such a molecular mechanism lies in the difficulty in identifying Cr(III)'s molecular targets in cells. These biomolecules are crucial for elucidating Cr(III)'s physiological and pharmacological effects, constituting the so-called \"Holy Grail\" of chromium biochemistry.To date, no proteins that directly bind Cr(III) have been identified in cells or tissues. Various controversial separation and detection methods often produce weak Cr(III) signals, which might be attributed to the dissociation of Cr(III) from its bound proteins. Currently, there is no suitable method for tracking Cr(III)-binding proteins in living cells. For metals that bind weakly or transiently to proteins, labeling metalloproteins with a small molecule fluorescent probe is beneficial for understanding their spatiotemporal distribution and functional regulation in living cells.      Key findingsBuilding on their previous work, the team synthesized a fluorescent probe for tracking and recognizing Cr(III)-binding proteins in living cells. The probe consists of three parts: a fluorophore (coumarin derivative (AC), a metal chelating group (i.e., nitrilotriacetate (NTA)) and a photoactive crosslinking group (i.e., arylazide). Upon chelation with chromium (III), the probe enters the cell, subsequently binds its target proteins, and the arylazide group forms a covalent bond with Cr(III)-binding proteins (i.e., target proteins) upon ultraviolet light irradiation. This leads to fixing the Cr(III)-binding proteins in cells without dissociation during downstream purification.Using these probes, the team monitored the distribution of Cr(III)-binding proteins in living cells, and found that they were concentrated in the cells' mitochondria. These proteins were identified in conjunction with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The researchers discovered that Cr(III) binds residues of Thr213 and Glu242 in ATP synthase's active site, replacing magnesium ion (Mg2+), reducing ATP synthase activity, and leading to AMPK activation. The AMPK pathway then alleviates mitochondrial damage caused by high glucose and improves glucose metabolism. This mode of action was successfully verified in a mouse model of type II diabetes.This study addresses how Cr(III) improves hyperglycemic stress at the molecular level for the first time. With the identification of multiple Cr(III)-binding proteins, this study also opens a new horizon for further investigation of the pharmacological role of Cr(III) in other diseases other than anti-diabetes, such as anti-neurodegenerative diseases and anti-aging new horizons.The reviewers speak highly of this work. \"It is an immensely important aspect of basic science and its implications for human health, and it is exactly what is needed: the identification of molecular targets, an endeavor that has met with rather limited success in the last 70 years. Chromium supplements are a huge market worldwide (sold for weight loss, and muscle building). With controversies about their mode of action, it is rather questionable gambling with our health. Thus, the work addresses a major health issue that needs to be carefully evaluated for either the protection of large populations or the benefit for them concerning antidiabetic actions of chromium(III). The authors address chromium biology with a new approach of chemical biology and an impressive number of biochemical, molecular biological, and animal experiments.\" More information:Haibo Wang et al, Mitochondrial ATP synthase as a direct molecular target of chromium(III) to ameliorate hyperglycaemia stress, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "One of the most widely used plastics in the world is polyethylene terephthalate, or PET for short. It is everywhere in our daily lives in the form of reusable PET drink bottles. At the end of the lifecycle of a product containing PET, the environmentally friendly reuse of the PET components through the activity of enzymes is an economically and ecologically interesting alternative to incineration, landfill or purely chemical recycling.          A team of researchers from Leipzig University has discovered how an enzyme that can break down PET works, and has further increased the efficiency of this biocatalyst. The scientists report their findings in the current issue of the journal Nature Communications.\"Our previous article on the discovery of this enzyme in the summer of 2021 already made big waves,\" says Dr. Christian Sonnendecker, who played a key role in the first publication. \"This outstanding teamwork became the most successful research article to date in the journal ChemSusChem.\"To understand how the biocatalyst works, lead author Konstantin Richter first used crystals to elucidate the spatial structure of the enzyme in his doctoral thesis. \"In a way, we were following up on the determination of the first structure of a PET-degrading enzyme,\" says Professor Norbert Str\u00e4ter, who heads the crystallographic investigations. \"That was almost 10 years ago, when Wolfgang Zimmermann established this biotechnological enzyme research in Leipzig. At that time, hardly anyone had it on their radar.\"To extract the secrets of PHL7's highly efficient reaction acceleration from the static crystal structures, Christian Sonnendecker enlisted the help of other experts in his research. The working groups led by Georg K\u00fcnze and Christian Wiebeler used computer simulations of protein dynamics as well as quantum chemical calculations to understand the reaction mechanism and, in particular, the contribution of individual amino acids to the binding of the PET polymer, and to design better enzymes. \"These predictions and calculations are extremely helpful in rationally improving an enzyme,\" explains Sonnendecker, \"but in the end, of course, the experiment decides.\"                PET film degradation and thermal stability of PHL7 variants. a PET film weight loss after reaction times of 4\u2009h and 8\u2009h at 70\u00b0C, data normalized to PHL7 WT. b PET film weight loss (in weight %, after 16\u2009h) of PHL7 WT compared to variants with reduced thermal stability at lower reaction temperatures. c Analysis of PET film thickness reduction between 10\u2009h to 15\u2009h of reaction by impedance spectroscopy (n\u2009=\u20095 replicates). d Melting temperatures of PHL7 WT and its variants.

When asked what the future holds for the research, Sonnendecker explains his plans for the interdisciplinary research network: \"Together with the expert J\u00f6rg Matysik, we want to use newly developed methods of nuclear resonance spectroscopy to investigate the binding of the enzyme to the polymer substrate. This will bring our experiments closer than ever to the real processes of protein-plastic interaction.\"Work is already underway on the third generation of the enzyme, extending human rational design to include machine prediction using artificial intelligence. \"For this, we have completely new screening methods at our disposal, such as the so-called impedance spectroscopy platform recently developed by Ronny Frank, which feeds high-quality training data to the AI,\" Sonnendecker explains.However, the early career researcher from the Institute of Analytical Chemistry at the Leipzig University sees the future primarily in bioplastics, which are based on renewable raw materials instead of petroleum-based ones and are also more readily biodegradable from the outset. A company is being set up to make his vision a reality.\"In the medium term, we are establishing a technological alternative to the fossil-dominated plastics industry and creating artificial CO2 storage,\" says Sonnendecker, who sees a \"green future with a view to plant-based raw materials.\" More information:P.

Somewhat less well-known, but just as ubiquitous, are organic light-emitting diodes, or OLEDs for short. This technology is used in the screens of smartphones, tablets and monitors. It is cheaper to produce in the form of a thin-film component, but cannot yet compete with conventional LEDs in some ways, such as in light output and lifespan.          In the search for new molecules that possess the characteristics needed for OLEDs, compounds known as helicenes are playing a central role. Helicenes are a group of substances in which rings made up of six carbon atoms (benzene rings) are joined together in a helical structure. When synthesizing these compounds, it was previously difficult to control the direction in which the molecules twist\u2014their \"chirality.\" It was only possible with certain types of helicenes and to a very limited extent.A new concept in synthesisProfessor Olivier Baudoin, Dr. Shu-Min Guo and Soohee Huh from the University of Basel's Department of Chemistry have just made an important step forward. In the latest issue of Nature Chemistry, they describe a new concept in the synthesis of these important chiral molecules.In their synthesis route, the Basel researchers make use of a reaction that can split a carbon-hydrogen and carbon-bromine bond and create a carbon-carbon bond. This is called C-H activation, and over the past few years it has developed into a valuable tool in synthesis. This method allows chemists to create helicenes with the desired chirality, and could also be suitable for longer chains of benzene rings.Researchers at Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay in France have been able to demonstrate that the products synthesized by the team from Basel strongly absorb and emit circularly polarized light\u2014an important characteristic for the development of new materials that rely on twisted molecules, as OLEDs do.\"Our results show the great potential of this strategy for the synthesis of such complex functional molecules,\" says Olivier Baudoin.

  "text": "Contaminated drinking water poses a major threat to our health. However, various pollutants such as pesticides, herbicides, hormones, medicines and other chemical compounds cannot be completely removed from groundwater with the methods currently available. At the same time, contamination by these substances is steadily increasing. A current example is glyphosate, which is used worldwide for weed control and poses potential dangers to humans and the environment.          A team led by Prof. Dominik Eder (TU Wien, Institute of Materials Chemistry) has now developed a new class of materials\u2014so-called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)\u2014which can be used to selectively and efficiently remove the herbicide glyphosate from groundwater. The researchers recently published their results in the scientific journal Advanced Functional Materials.Small volume, large surfaceMOFs are materials consisting of tiny metal oxide clusters connected by organic molecules to form a highly porous, sponge-like network. They have an extremely large surface area of up to 7000 m\u00b2/g. \" This means that you can fit an entire football field within just one gram of MOFs,\" Dominik Eder says. \"Consequently, a lot of molecules can adsorb within the pores, making MOFs ideal materials for directly capturing molecules from air and water, such as CO2, inorganic salts and organic pollutants.\"The special thing about MOFs is that they can be customized depending on the application. Shaghayegh Naghdi, lead author of the study, explains: \"Think of MOFs as a large building consisting of individual tiny blocks. Each block is made up of metal atoms or organic molecules and you put them together like a puzzle to achieve the desired functions.\"'Mesopores for large moleculesHowever, a crucial limitation of MOFs for their use in liquid media is the accessibility of active sites deep inside the material, where the adsorption processes and chemical reactions take place. To reach these sites, the target molecules must diffuse through micropores with diameters of less than 1 nanometer, which is often the size of the molecules themselves. In liquid media, solvent molecules can significantly slow down this diffusion process and clog the pores.To solve this problem, the research group has developed a strategy to incorporate additional pores with a diameter of up to 10 nanometers, so-called mesopores, into the MOFs. How does this work? \"We selectively burn away a certain part of the organic compound molecules,\" Naghdi explains. \"However, we need to do this very carefully, in order to avoid collapse of the overall micropore structure.\" The team has already tested this strategy for various applications in liquid media.Successful removal of glyphosateIn collaboration with researchers from the University of Northern British Columbia in Canada, Dominik Eder's team finally investigated the adsorption of glyphosate from groundwater. Remarkably, the new material was able to remove three times as much glyphosate in only 20% of the time as the currently best adsorbent.With the help of computer simulations carried out at the Technion in Israel, the group also discovered that the removal of the organic linkers creates new metal sites. These allow the formation of chemical bonds with glyphosate and thus faster diffusion of the target molecule. \"These bonds are strong enough to adsorb glyphosate and similar organic compounds very quickly and efficiently. Yet, they are weak enough to remove glyphosate quantitatively with a simple sodium chloride salt solution, so that these MOFs can be used multiple times,\" Dominik Eder explains.

Already the basis of a fledgling industry, they're a class of polymers naturally created by living microorganisms, or synthetically produced from biorenewable feedstocks. They're biodegradable in the ambient environment, including oceans and soil.          But there's a reason PHAs haven't taken off as a sustainable, environmentally benign alternative to traditional plastics. Crystalline PHAs are brittle, so not as durable and convenient as conventional plastics. They cannot easily be melt-processed and recycled, making them expensive to produce.Colorado State University polymer chemists led by Eugene Chen, University Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemistry, have created a synthetic PHA platform that addresses each of these problems, paving the way for a future in which PHAs can take off in the marketplace as truly sustainable plastics.Chen and colleagues report a new class of redesigned PHAs, readily accessible via chemical catalysis, in the journal Science.The researchers had been searching for a strategy to address the intrinsic thermal instability of conventional PHAs; their lack of heat resistance also makes it difficult to melt-process them into end products. The CSU chemists made fundamental changes to the structures of these plastics, substituting reactive hydrogen atoms responsible for thermal degradation with more robust methyl groups. This structural modification drastically enhances the PHAs' thermal stability, resulting in plastics that can be melt-processed without decomposition.What's more, these newly designed PHAs are mechanically tough, even outperforming the two most common commodity plastics: high-density polyethylene\u2014used in products like milk and shampoo bottles\u2014and isotactic propylene, which is used to make automotive parts and synthetic fibers. The best part is that the new PHA can be chemically recycled back to its building-block molecule, called a monomer, with a simple catalyst and heat, and the recovered clean monomer can be reused to reproduce the same PHA again\u2014in principle, infinitely.\"We are adding three key desired features to the biological PHAs, including closed-loop chemical recycling, which is essential for achieving a circular PHA economy,\" Chen said.

  "text": "A new perspective published in the journal Nature Chemical Biology uncovers a previously unknown biochemical recycling process in animals. The authors review a flurry of recent papers demonstrating that animals extensively recycle biochemical waste to produce novel chemicals that play key roles in biology, from regulating behavior to development and aging.       These studies show that the genes previously thought to code for carboxylesterases, enzymes that hydrolyze esters, actually play a pivotal role in assembling a wide range of new metabolites from building blocks generally considered \"cellular waste.\" Surprisingly, the so-called carboxylesterases were found to contribute to the formation of esters and amide bonds, a function opposite to that predicted by computational algorithms.\"This discovery reveals that our understanding of biochemistry remains largely incomplete,\" says the perspective's lead author, Frank Schroeder, a professor at Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI). \"This research has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of how animals, including humans, function.\"Recent investigations indicate that animals and humans may produce over 100,000 distinct chemicals, most of which have not been investigated. This unknown structure space is a treasure trove of chemicals, which may hold the key to understanding many biological processes. One major challenge to understanding how these metabolites contribute to survival is that the enzymes that produce them are also unknown.\"The discovery of this biochemical recycling mechanism opens up exciting new avenues for future research, with the potential to dramatically accelerate the structural and functional annotation of unknown metabolites,\" says Chester Wrobel, a graduate student in the Schroeder lab and co-author of the perspective.

  "text": "Cancer-causing chlorinated paraffins are still used in a wide range of everyday products sold in North America, despite their known health harm and being banned in Canada for a decade, according to a new study in Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts. The researchers detected short-chain chlorinated paraffins in more than 85% of products tested, including headphones, plastic toys, clothing, personal care products, and indoor paints purchased in Canada.          \"We were astonished to find chlorinated paraffins in these types of products. Any parent would shudder at the thought of their baby chewing on a toy filled with cancer-causing chemicals,\" said co-author Hui Peng, an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the University of Toronto. \"We need to protect our children and the wider public from these harmful substances.\"Short-chain chlorinated paraffins cause cancer in laboratory rats and mice\u2014specifically targeting the liver, thyroid, and kidney. Though there are no human studies, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies them as possible human carcinogens. They also build up in our bodies, food webs, and environment.In 2012, the Government of Canada determined that \"all chlorinated paraffins are considered harmful with respect to human health,\" and banned their manufacture, new use, and import. In 2017, short-chain chlorinated paraffins were listed for elimination under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.Nonetheless, their total global production is huge\u2014more than 1 million tons per year\u2014and is increasing. These toxic chemicals are used in everyday products as flame retardants, plasticizers and lubricants. Until now, many of their specific uses in products were not known to scientists and the public.The highest concentrations of chlorinated paraffins in this study were detected in headphones and computer wires. The next highest concentrations were in toys and toy packaging. These uses can lead to human exposure through direct hand contact, mouthing of products by young children, and through contaminated dust making its way from hands to mouths.Since the tested products were largely manufactured for an international market, chlorinated paraffins are likely also found in similar products in the U.S., Europe, and beyond.\"Chlorinated paraffins are very harmful and widespread in everyday products, but they are flying under the radar,\" said co-author Arlene Blum, executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute. \"Many of their uses are unnecessary and should be stopped immediately for healthier people and ecosystems.\" More information:Steven Kutarna et al, Widespread presence of chlorinated paraffins in consumer products, Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts (2023).

The review was led by Prof. Junwang Tang, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London; and Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University.          \"Methane, with its huge reserve and wide application, has caused a strong greenhouse effect due to its high global warming potential nearly 30 times that of CO2. Catalytic oxidation of methane directly to CO2 offers a potential pathway to mitigate the adverse impact caused by methane emission,\" Tang says.\"Traditional thermocatalysis uses noble metal or transition metal and their oxides as catalysts to convert methane into CO2 and H2O with O2 at high temperatures. Alternatively, photocatalysis opens a green pathway to drive this reaction at ambient conditions in the presence of a photocatalyst and under light irradiation. Development of methane removal process via both thermocatalysis and photocatalysis hold[s] great importance in scientific research, and significant potential in large-scale applications as well.\"The recent catalytic methane oxidation processes are thus reviewed as follows:The development of thermocatalysts, especially Pd-based catalysts are summarized and comparedThe deactivation of thermocatalysts at high temperatures and in the presence of H2O, sulfur contents, etc., is discussedFundamental studies on the evolution of catalysts and surface chemistry during the catalytic process by advanced spectroscopies and microscopies are reviewedThe synthesis and performance of photocatalysts for methane oxidation are comparedThe underlying photophysics and surface chemistry processes in photocatalytic methane oxidation are discussed to guide future studies.Future work should focus on the development of efficient thermocatalysts work at lower temperatures or photocatalysts response to visible light. Reactor design is another important aspect to improve the overall performance of the reaction; however, it is overlooked in many studies.

  "text": "Neutrons from the Research Neutron Source Heinz Maier-Leibnitz (FRM II) can be used to explore the structure of biomolecules. The most recent success: the precise analysis of a promising vaccine against multidrug-resistant germs.          Bacteria which are resistant to all conventional antibiotics cause more than a million deaths each year. Consequently, researchers around the world are searching for new therapeutic approaches to combat these pathogens. Two years ago an international team in Grenoble identified an active ingredient suitable for the production of a vaccine against multidrug resistant bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The vaccine has in the meantime been successfully tested on mice.\"As with many new vaccines, in this case the active ingredient is embedded in liposomes. The exact characterization and understanding of these nanoscopic biomolecules is a key factor in the development and optimization of future vaccines,\" says Dr. Marco Maccarini, biophysicist at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). Together with experts at the TIMC laboratory of the Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes (UGA) and at the FRM II he has successfully analyzed the structure of the candidate vaccine against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.The vaccine consists of biomolecules with sizes in the order of 100 nanometers. These molecules consist mostly of lipids, substances similar to fats, which form small bubbles or liposomes because of their biochemical properties. These bubbles can in turn protect and transport the actual active ingredients. In the case of the vaccine against Pseudomonas aeruoginosa, this active ingredient is the protein OprF. \"In general, the active ingredient can dock to the liposome at various positions\u2014for example internally or externally,\" Maccarini explains. \"But it is best recognized by the immune system when it is integrated in the double lipid layer. Thus the structure of the biomolecule is decisive in the efficacy of a vaccine.\"Wanted: Non-destructive radiationSuch structural details are not visible to the naked eye. Optical microscopes do not have a high enough resolution for the investigation of liposomes. Although X-ray radiation has shorter wavelengths, it is unsuitable for structural analysis, since the radiation can damage the biomolecules under certain circumstances. \"But neutron beams are ideal: They only interact with atomic nuclei and thus cause no damage or structural changes. This way the samples can be investigated in their original condition,\" Maccarini says.The researcher found everything he needed to analyze the new candidate vaccine at the FRM II in Garching near Munich: a high neutron flux, a well-equipped laboratory and Dr. Aurel Radulescu, an expert in the measurement of small-angle scattering, a technology which can be used to investigate the nanometer-sized molecules in detail.Computer model represents structure of the vaccines\"In our case the challenge was using the diffractometer, which measures the scattering of the neutrons by the atomic nuclei, to distinguish between the proteins and the lipids in the sample,\" recalls Radulescu, who supervises the small-angle scattering diffractometer KWS-2 for the Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich (FZJ) in Garching. He adds that it took a trick to finally make this distinction work: \"We conducted the measurements with different combinations of solvents\u2014normal water and heavy water containing deuterium, mixed in various concentrations.\" Since neutrons \"see\" normal hydrogen and deuterium differently, the result was images of the sample with different contrasts that contained distinct information.For the analysis the research team developed a computer model that represents the structure of the candidate vaccine. \"This lets us not only render the two-layer structure of the lipids, but also lets us determine the average position and amount of the OprF active ingredient which is embedded between the two lipid layers.\"The work is published in the journal Langmuir. The new model can also be used to investigate the structure of new, liposome-based vaccines and to optimize their further development.

  "text": "Most antimicrobial wipes, which are predominantly made of synthetic fibers like polyester and polypropylene, are discarded after a single use and end up in landfills where they can stay for hundreds of years and become a source of environmental microplastic fiber pollution. But, researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) recently developed sustainable machine-washable antimicrobial wipes that can be used at least 30 times for cleaning hard and nonporous surfaces.          There has been a remarkable increase in the use of antimicrobial wipes due to the growing awareness of personal health protection. According to the Antimicrobial Wipes Market Outlook report, the worldwide antimicrobial wipes market is estimated to reach $21.6 billion by 2030.ARS researchers developed antimicrobial wipes by using raw cotton fiber that naturally produced silver nanoparticles inside the fiber in the presence of a silver precursor. These embedded silver nanoparticles can then release silver ions that act as antibacterial agents and kill harmful bacteria.\"Silver nanoparticles are one of the popular antimicrobial agents used for producing odor-inhibiting, anti-infective textile products and other personal health products,\" said Sunghyun Nam, research engineer at ARS's Cotton Chemistry and Utilization Research Unit in New Orleans.According to Nam, people will be able to clean surfaces by wetting the antimicrobial cloths with tap water and then wiping surfaces. In their research, scientists found that the wipes killed 99.9% of harmful bacteria S. aureus and P. aeruginosa on surfaces.The technology behind this research is advantageous in several aspects. It omits the conventional pretreatments of raw cotton fibers (such as scouring and bleaching), which consume a large number of chemicals and energy. It does not require any chemical agents except for a silver precursor.It also transforms cotton fibers themselves into antimicrobial agents rather than serving as a carrier of antimicrobial agents, which is what makes them reusable. The antimicrobial wipes are made from natural cotton fibers, rather than conventional petroleum-based synthetic fibers.To reuse the wipes, people can simply wash them in the laundry.\"We also found that the wipes still successfully killed pathogens even after being washed 30 times in the laundry,\" said Nam. \"The wipes regenerate their antimicrobial surface every time they are wet or washed because the embedded nanoparticles act as a reservoir of silver ions.\"Nam said that another important benefit of the embedding technology is to minimize the negative environmental impacts related to the leaching of nanoparticles.\"These wipes are designed to gradually give off low levels of silver ions from the nanoparticles embedded inside the cotton fiber over the full course of the time of use and deplete nanoparticles,\" said Nam.By developing reusable and washable antimicrobial wipes, Nam and her colleagues are aiming to find sustainable alternatives to reduce environmental waste from the disposal of single-use antimicrobial wipes.More details about the study and the technology behind the antimicrobial wipes are published in the journal Molecules.

  "text": "Hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH) is the most reactive oxidant and plays important roles in the biogeochemical cycle of elements and the attenuation of contaminants in the environment. In recent years, the redox reaction of iron in subsurface sediments was found to produce \u00b7OH naturally, even in dark conditions without the presence of exogenous hydrogen peroxide. However, the effect of mineral-associated soil organic matter (SOM) on the process is not well understood.          In a study published in Environmental Science & Technology, a research team led by Prof. Zhu Yongguan and Li Gang from the Institute of Urban Environment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported the influence of humic substances, the major components of SOM, on the microbially mediated iron reduction and reoxidation processes, and established the pathway of \u00b7OH production in different SOM-containing system.The researchers used fulvic acid (FA), humic acid (HA), and humin (HM), components of humic substances operationally separated from soil, to evaluate the influence of SOM characteristics on iron redox processes. They found that high electron exchange capacity of FA and HA promoted the microbial iron reduction process, while HA with high electron donating capacity inhibited the yield of \u00b7OH.Using the scavengers of possible intermediate involved in \u00b7OH production, the researchers established different pathways for \u00b7OH production in SOM-containing system. They found that the one-electron transfer process dominated the \u00b7OH production in the FA-containing system, while both one- and two-electron transfer processes were present in HA- and HM-containing systems.Additionally, the researchers found that microbially mediated iron redox processes changed the properties of dissolved fractions of SOM, and the aromaticity of dissolved fraction of HA decreased due to its high reactivity with \u00b7OH.Based on the high-resolution transmission electron microscope and X-ray diffractometer, ferrous secondary minerals formed and SOM inhibited its transformation to higher stable and crystalline iron oxy(hydr)oxides.This work advances the understanding of SOM-involved iron redox processes and \u00b7OH production. The mechanisms revealed need to be considered when evaluating the effect of potentially produced \u00b7OH on pollutants degradation in redox fluctuating environments.

  "text": "After nearly a century of scientific inquiry, scientists have at last been able to characterize a key component in the substance responsible for giving countless living organisms their color.          In the study, published online today in the journal Nature Chemistry, an international team of researchers isolated a key molecule involved in the synthesis of melanin, a substance in the human body that produces pigmentation in the hair and skin and protects cells from being damaged by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The molecule they studied has many of the physical properties of eumelanin, a type of melanin that typically produces only black and brown pigments.Despite what researchers know about melanin, its chemical structure has remained elusive, said Bern Kohler, an Ohio Eminent Scholar and professor of chemistry and biochemistry at The Ohio State University, one of three senior authors on the study.\"Melanin is literally as plain as the nose on our face and we still don't know exactly what it's made of and how it works,\" said Kohler. \"It's thought to be a material made of large numbers of interacting components, and so what my collaborators and I are trying to get at is, what are melanin's underlying chemical units and what are the interactions that give rise to its properties?\"In the lab, melanin can be made naturally from just a few simple chemical substances that combine or react to form the pigmented material. Thanks to the efforts of Jean-Philip Lumb of McGill University and Lluis Blancafort of the University of Girona, the team was able to successfully synthesize and analyze one of its molecule-sized ingredients. They found that it had many of the same properties as the final product melanin, even without further transformation.\"Melanin is like a complex dish that you cook from just a few ingredients,\" said Kohler. \"Given that melanin granules in skin contain billions of atoms, it was surprising to see melanin-like properties emerge in a molecule containing only a few dozen atoms.\"As a spectroscopist\u2014or a scientist who investigates the interactions between matter and light\u2014Kohler said what he finds most remarkable is the brilliant green color of the melanin-like molecule, which is able to absorb deep red light.\"That's very hard for a small molecule to do,\" said Kohler. \"This is one of the smallest organic molecules known that can absorb long wavelengths all the way out into the infrared.\"Its unusual optical and magnetic properties make the melanin-mimicking molecule an attractive prospect for advancing bioelectronics research, a field that aims to connect electronics and living biological materials to fabricate new technologies or therapies for medical treatments, said Kohler.The study results also suggest that harnessing the power of melanin could be used to change the way humans harvest energy from our environment.\"Like solar energy conversion, part of our strategy for alternative energy is to absorb photons of light from across the solar spectrum,\" Kohler said. \"That's what eumelanin does, rather naturally.\"Future research will aim to study melanin-like properties in similar kinds of molecules. Such strides could offer greater accessibility to synthetic biomaterial alternatives, but in the short term, Kohler imagines the team's work uncovering a melanin-like molecule will inspire other labs to look more closely at how melanin's properties may emerge from other unexpectedly small molecular units.\"Our team is excited that further progress at understanding the structure of melanin can succeed by studying tailorable small molecules like the one we write about in this paper,\" he said. \"The chemistry is still tremendously complex, but interest should grow in small molecules as melanin models and the promise they hold for generating new, melanin-inspired materials.\" More information:Xueqing Wang et al, Indole-5,6-quinones display hallmark properties of eumelanin, Nature Chemistry (2023).

  "text": "Three engineers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have invented a fabric that concludes the 80-year quest to make a synthetic textile modeled on Polar bear fur. The results, published recently in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, are already being developed into commercially available products.          Polar bears live in some of the harshest conditions on earth, shrugging off Arctic temperatures as low as -50 Fahrenheit. While the bears have many adaptations that allow them to thrive when the temperature plummets, since the 1940s scientists have focused on one in particular: their fur. How, the scientific community has asked, does a polar bear's fur keep them warm?Typically, we think that the way to stay warm is to insulate ourselves from the weather. But there's another way: One of the major discoveries of the last few decades is that many polar animals actively use the sunlight to maintain their temperature, and polar bear fur is a well-known case in point.Scientists have known for decades that part of the bears' secret is their white fur. One might think that black fur would be better at absorbing heat, but it turns out that the polar bears' fur is extremely effective at transmitting solar radiation toward the bears' skin.\"But the fur is only half the equation,\" says the paper's senior author, Trisha L. Andrew, associate professor of chemistry and adjunct in chemical engineering at UMass Amherst. \"The other half is the polar bears' black skin.\"As Andrew explains it, polar bear fur is essentially a natural fiberoptic, conducting sunlight down to the bears' skin, which absorbs the light, heating the bear. But the fur is also exceptionally good at preventing the now-warmed skin from radiating out all that hard-won warmth. When the sun shines, it's like having a thick blanket that warms itself up, and then traps that warmth next to your skin.What Andrew and her team have done is to engineer a bilayer fabric whose top layer is composed of threads that, like polar bear fur, conduct visible light down to the lower layer, which is made of nylon and coated with a dark material called PEDOT. PEDOT, like the polar bears' skin, warms efficiently.So efficiently, in fact, that a jacket made of such material is 30% lighter than the same jacket made of cotton yet will keep you comfortable at temperatures 10 degrees Celsius colder than the cotton jacket could handle, as long as the sun is shining or a room is well lit.\"Space heating consumes huge amounts of energy that is mostly fossil fuel-derived,\" says Wesley Viola, the paper's lead author, who completed his Ph.D. in chemical engineering at UMass and is now at Andrew's startup, Soliyarn, LLC.\"While our textile really shines as outerwear on sunny days, the light-heat trapping structure works efficiently enough to imagine using existing indoor lighting to directly heat the body. By focusing energy resources on the 'personal climate' around the body, this approach could be far more sustainable than the status quo.\" More information:Wesley Viola et al, Solar Thermal Textiles for On-Body Radiative Energy Collection Inspired by Polar Animals, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2023).

Green chemistry and chemical engineering have opened up possibilities for sustainability through the transformation of renewable feedstocks into environmentally friendly chemicals. However, the inert bonds in molecules such as CO2 and N2 present challenges to their activation and conversion.          Electrochemical conversion provides a promising carbon-neutral route to upgrading green chemical sources with inert bonds to chemicals and fuels under ambient conditions. Multicomponent electrocatalysts have advantages over monocomponent catalysts, such as better stability, increased activity, and expanded reaction processes.Multicomponent electrocatalysts offer a promising solution to the challenge of sustainability in the chemical industry.

So, we explored the use of multicomponent catalysts in the electroreduction of small molecules such as CO2, N2, and NOx. We developed three models for multicomponent catalysts: Type I, Type II, and Type III, which we discuss in our paper.\"Type I involves a non-catalytic active component that can activate or protect another catalytic component.

  "text": "The research team of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT) has designed and developed a novel recycling process for producing biomass-derived chemicals by reusing the by-products of the target product. In this study, the research team demonstrated a self-sustaining process that minimizes the usage of external utilities in the chemical process by numerical simulations.          This achievement has significantly contributed to energy conservation by reusing by-products, which had been disposed of in the conventional process in the chemical process to ensure profitability. In addition, while previous processes were designed on a large scale, this study was designed with a biomass supply feasible in all regions.This is a completely different approach from conventional processes. With this achievement, we can significantly reduce petroleum usage in chemical processes to establish a recycling-oriented society in the future. In addition, for regional revitalization, it is expected to create a chemical industry for local production for local consumption using agricultural and forestry waste in mountainous regions.The results have been published in Chemical Engineering Research and Design .Biomass is the renewable carbon resource that can replace fossil resources in chemical production. Among the biomass-derived chemicals, levulinic acid (LA) is attracting attention as a platform chemical because it can be synthesized from cellulose, which makes up about 50% of woody biomass, and is a precursor for a wide range of substances from pharmaceuticals to bio-fuels.Conventional LA production processes from biomass are large-scale processes with an annual biomass supply of more than 120,000 tons, and had challenges in effectively utilizing all biomass resources.In response, this research team has developed a process that minimizes the supply of external utilities by reusing by-products produced during the production of LA from biomass as much as possible while still being able to supply all of the required energy from the combustion of by-products.Specifically, by reusing the by-product formic acid as a catalyst, using a chemical called furfural obtained from biomass as an extraction solvent to purify LA, and combusting the solid by-products, the total process energy was reduced and supplied by itself. Furthermore, it was found that the excess solid by-products could be effectively utilized for building materials and other purposes. We also found that using river water could provide all the cooling needed.The amount of river water is less than 0.12% of the minimum annual volume flow in the middle reaches of the Naka River in Tochigi Prefecture, located in a rural area of Japan.Regarding economics, the minimum selling price of LA produced by this process was $9.59 per kilogram, which was higher than the market price of $7.17 per kilogram. The reason is due to the fact that this process allows for thin profit margins to some extent, which is an advantage of large-scale processes, and also because no separation and purification of by-products are performed.The results of this research indicate that this process can be fully implemented in society for a locally produced and consumed chemical industry using agricultural and forestry waste in mountainous regions.

  "answer_squad": " 93.8%",
  "text": "Odorous gases, which are unpleasant and strongly irritating to the eyes, nose, and respiratory tract, are ubiquitous in facilities such as septic tanks, sewage systems, livestock farms, and waste disposal plants. These gases exert a negative impact on the human body as well as the surrounding environment, thus numerous ways have been developed to eliminate them. Typical odor removal methods use activated carbon as an adsorbent.          However, activated carbon has low recyclability, making it difficult to remove the sources of complex odorous gases for reuse.A research team led by Dr. Jiwon Lee and Youngtak Oh of the Sustainable Environment Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) announced that they developed an activated carbon manufacturing technology that dramatically improves the removal of four representative nitrogen-containing odorous compounds (NOCs) from air: ammonia, ethylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine.Not only did the research team improve the adsorption efficiency of activated carbon for removing odor substances, but they have also discovered the adsorption mechanism between adsorbents and odorous gases, making it possible to develop a wider variety of adsorbents for complex odor substances.The research team was able to precisely control the degree of surface oxidation to increase the adsorption efficiency of NOCs through an thermal annealing process after oxidizing the activated carbon with nitric acid. They found that the most oxidized heat-treated activated carbon could increase the removal efficiency of odor substances by up to 38 times compared to conventional activated carbon.For the first time, the researchers revealed that the oxygen atoms on the surface of oxidized activated carbon form strong hydrogen bonds with the amines in nitrogen-containing odor molecules. This finding reflects the principle of optimizing the adsorption effect of NOCs by increasing the degree of oxidation so that more hydrogen bonds can be formed with amines on the surface of activated carbon.Furthermore, the research team also demonstrated that unlike typical gas reactions, the interaction between the adsorbent and odor substances was primarily influenced by the number of hydrogen bonds, rather than proton affinity.                DFT calculation result and nitrogen-containing odorous compound selectivity of heat-dried activated carbo. Credit: Korea Institute of Science and Technology             Furthermore, thermally dried activated carbon(TDAC) was found to increase selectivity for trimethylamine by more than 13 times. This result represents a substantial improvement, as trimethylamine has the lowest adsorption efficiency among conventional NOCs.Trimethylamine, a designated odor substance regulated by law in Korea, is a typical source of odors in agriculture, landfills, and sewage and waste water treatment plants. In particular, the heat-dried activated carbon has an average recyclability of 93.8% for trimethylamine, showing high economic efficiency compared to the 63% recyclability of conventional activated carbon.\"By identifying the adsorption mechanism of odorous gases, we can develop materials that are specialized for removing specific gases, and heat-dried activated carbon, which undergoes an oxidation process, is relatively simple to produce and can be reused. Thus, it can be applied as a material for purification devices such as filters and masks,\" claimed Dr. Jiwon Lee of KIST.The study is published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.

  "text": "A team led by Prof. Zhang Kaiming from the University of Science and Technology (USTC) solved six conformations in the second-step self-splicing of Tetrahymena ribozyme using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), revealing the mechanism of group 1 introns coordinating self-splicing reactions. Their work was published in Nature Communications.          Group \u2160 introns are catalytic RNAs that can fold into tertiary structure with a active site with the help of metal ions, thereby promoting catalysis without proteins. However, the analysis of RNA structures faces enormous challenges due to the heterogeneity and flexibility of RNA. Since the discovery of Tetrahymena group I introns, numerous studies have elucidated its underlying catalytic mechanism, but the 3D structure of the full-length molecule and its rearrangements are yet to be obtained.To resolve the structural mechanism and the conformation changes in the self-splicing reactions, Prof. Zhang Kaiming's team first designed the substrates for the self-splicing reactions. After verifying that the substrates could complete the catalytic reactions and determining the optimal reaction conditions, the team captured structure snapshots of different conformations of Tetrahymena ribozyme during the self-spicing process using single-particle cryo-EM analysis.The first step starts from oligonucleotide substrate base pairing with the apoenzyme to form the P1-P1 extension duplex. After that, the tertiary interactions between P1 and three single-stranded segments within the catalytic core mediate docking of the duplex into the active site.Then the oligonucleotide product of the first step is released. The second step is the ligation reaction, where the 3'-exon substrates become docked in the ribozyme through tertiary contacts and metal coordination. Then the reaction goes gradually to an intermediate period, where metal coordination weakens and the tertiary interactions are lost.The exons are ligated in this period. Sequentially, the ribozyme relaxed and the product duplex undocks, reaching the substrate-free site. Finally, the duplex is unpaired and the product is released. Furthermore, the researchers also found structural evidences for the rearrangements of some hydrogen bonds and metal ions on active sites, which promote catalysis and coordinate self-splicing reactions.This research revealed the mechanism of self-splicing reaction on atomic level, proving the advantages of using cryo-EM to resolve RNA structure. With the increasing application of cryo-EM in the research of structurally heterogeneous molecules, it will become a vital tool in many other biological research like the folding of RNA systems.

  "text": "Newly synthesized organic molecules can be tuned to emit different colors depending on their molecular structures in crystal form.          Molecular switches are chemicals with molecular structures that can be shifted between two or more stable configurations in response to changes in their environment. They are of great interest in the development of molecular computers, molecular machines and drug delivery systems. Compounds with conformational isomers\u2014identical molecular formulas but different molecular structures\u2014can make very effective molecular switches.Researchers at Hokkaido University and Kyushu University have developed a technique to synthesize potential molecular switches from anthraquinodimethanes (AQDs), a group of overcrowded organic molecules. The study, led by Associate Professor Yusuke Ishigaki at Hokkaido University and Associate Professor Toshikazu Ono at Kyushu University, was published in the journal Materials Chemistry Frontiers.\"AQDs are a type of overcrowded ethylene, molecules with carbon-carbon double bonds surrounded by large chemical groups,\" explains Ono. \"They have two common isomers, the folded and twisted forms. They are especially interesting as molecular switches, as their sterically hindered double bond can provide isomers absorbing and emitting different wavelengths of light.\"                The folded and twisted isomers absorb different wavelengths of light. Credit: Materials Chemistry Frontiers (2023).  DOI: 10.1039/D2QM01199A             AQDs generally adopt the most stable folded or twisted form, making it difficult to isolate pure samples of any other isomer to study its properties. The researchers surmounted this obstacle by designing flexible AQD derivatives that can more easily and stably form different isomers.The synthesized derivatives were not only able to stably form twisted and folded isomers, but also other isomeric forms, when recrystallized in different solvents. The researchers performed detailed analysis of the derivatives to fully understand their properties.In a crystalline state, each of these isomers absorbs and emits distinct frequencies of light, which is due to the differences in the distribution of electrons in the isomer molecules. Interestingly, the light absorption and emission changed when the crystals were ground into amorphous solid, and following treatment with appropriate solvents can produce original or other crystals with a variety of colors.                    The methyl derivative of the new compound has four different isomers, with different crystal structures each. Credit: Materials Chemistry Frontiers (2023).

  "text": "Using solar energy and photocatalysts to convert CO2 into high value-added chemicals can simultaneously alleviate the greenhouse effect and energy crisis. Single atom cocatalysts decoration has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to improve the CO2 photocatalytic reduction efficiency.          Unfortunately, when unraveling the mechanism behind performance promotion, most studies mainly focus on clarifying the superior physicochemical and photoelectrical properties of SACs in comparison with the substrate. The critical role of the sing-atomic state distinguished from those oxide and elemental states was often neglected and remains a mystery.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Zhongbiao Wu and Haiqiang Wang from Zhejiang University, China, comprehensively investigated the effect of Pd chemical states on CO2 photocatalytic reduction of g-C3N4 (CN) under visible light irradiation, especially the critical role of Pd-SA in boosting CH4 production. The results were published in the Chinese Journal of Catalysis.Performance tests showed Pd species decoration improved the CH4 production of CN, with Pd/CN-SA exhibiting the optimum yields (2.25 \u03bcmol g-1), markedly higher than that of PdOx/CN (1.08 \u03bcmol g-1) and Pd/CN-NP (0.44 \u03bcmol g-1). After comprehensive mechanism analysis with various characterization techniques, in-situ FTIR spectra and DFT calculations, it was found that the conducive activation of CO2, negative conduction band potentials, and excellent \u2022H utilization efficiency, collaboratively contributed to the superior CO2 reduction performance of Pd/CN-SA, especially in the remarkably boosted CH4 production.In addition, despite the larger electron density of Pd/CN-NP and PdOx/CN, the moderate reduction ability of their photogenerated electrons restricted the further reduction of adsorbed CO2 species and CO intermediate, limiting the enhancement of CO2 reduction activity. Furthermore, the CH4 evolutions of Pd/CN-NP and PdOx/CN were also limited by the poor \u2022H supply and inferior \u2022H utilization efficiency, respectively.The new insights may advance the understanding of CO2 reduction process and inspire the design of efficient photocatalysts for CO2 photocatalytic conversion.

  "text": "The traditionally cumbersome yet widely-used Birch reduction can now be carried out in a mere minute in air using an optimized mechanochemical approach.          The Birch reduction is a reaction commonly used to make medicines and bioactive compounds, but the laborious process typically requires that chemists handle liquid ammonia, use cryogenic temperatures, and carry out time-consuming steps.Researchers at the Institute for Chemical Reaction Design and Discovery (WPI-ICReDD) in Hokkaido University have developed a simplified method for performing the Birch reduction that avoids the use of ammonia, can be done at room temperature and in ambient air, and is 20\u2013150 times faster than conventional methods. Their findings are published in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition.A number of lithium-based methods for performing the Birch reduction in solution have been previously developed, but since lithium reacts with both air and water, these processes still required complicated reaction setups with an inert atmosphere or dehydrated conditions. Researchers in this study saw an opportunity to avoid these issues by switching from a solution-based method to a solvent-less method using a ball mill, in which reactants are shaken rapidly in a small metal jar along with a metal ball that smashes the solid reactants together.\"In previous studies, we found that using a ball mill for reactions of metals such as magnesium and calcium with organic compounds improved the reaction rate and greatly simplified the process,\" said co-author Associate Professor Koji Kubota. \"Based on this, we wondered if we could develop a more straight-forward Birch reduction process by performing reactions of lithium metal with aromatic compounds in a ball mill.\"                Overview of the simplified protocol for the Birch reduction using a ball mill. Credit: Angewandte Chemie International Edition (2023).  DOI: 10.1002/anie.202217723             The key to this strategy is that the mechanical impact from the ball breaks through the surface layer on the lithium that reacted with the air, exposing the pure lithium underneath to the other reactants and enabling the Birch reduction to proceed. This approach can be carried out in ambient air and at room temperature, making for a much easier process.Researchers demonstrated the versatility of the process, successfully testing it with a wide variety of organic compounds, including pharmaceutical intermediates and other bioactive molecules. In most cases, the Birch reduction was completed in an astonishingly quick one minute.The process was successfully scaled up to larger gram-scale batches, and the team believes this technique could enable the simplified synthesis of a wide variety of molecules, while also marking an important advance in mechanochemistry.\"The Birch reduction is used extensively in drug discovery and various chemical industries, and our research has made significant advancements, resulting in a much simpler and more eco-friendly Birch reduction process,\" commented Professor Hajime Ito, who led the study. \"We expect this breakthrough to accelerate drug discovery and various other areas of chemical research.\" More information:Yunpeng Gao et al, Mechanochemical Approach for Air\u2010Tolerant and Extremely Fast Lithium\u2010Based Birch Reductions in Minutes, Angewandte Chemie International Edition (2023).

  "text": "Researchers at Binghamton University led research partnering with the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN)\u2014a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory\u2014to get a better look at how peroxides on the surface of copper oxide promote the oxidation of hydrogen but inhibit the oxidation of carbon monoxide, allowing them to steer oxidation reactions. They were able to observe these quick changes with two complimentary spectroscopy methods that have not been used in this way. The results of this work have been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).          \"Copper is one of the most studied and relevant surfaces, both in catalysis and in corrosion science,\" explained Anibal Boscoboinik, materials scientist at CFN. \"So many mechanical parts that are used in industry are made of copper, so trying to understand this element of the corrosion processes is very important.\"\"I've always liked looking at copper systems,\" said Ashley Head also a materials scientist at CFN. \"They have such interesting properties and reactions, some of which are really striking.\"Gaining a better understanding of oxide catalysts gives researchers more control of the chemical reactions they produce, including solutions for clean energy. Copper, for example, can catalytically form and convert methanol into valuable fuels, so being able to control the amount of oxygen and number of electrons on copper is a key step to efficient chemical reactions.Peroxide as a proxyPeroxides are chemical compounds that contain two oxygen atoms linked by shared electrons. The bond in peroxides is fairly weak, allowing other chemicals to alter its structure, which makes them very reactive. In this experiment, scientists were able to alter the redox steps of catalytic oxidation reactions on an oxidized copper surface (CuO) by identifying the makeup of peroxide species formed with different gases: O2 (oxygen), H2 (hydrogen), and CO (carbon monoxide).Redox is a combination of reduction and oxidation. In this process, the oxidizing agent gains an electron and the reducing agent loses an electron. When comparing these different peroxide species and how these steps played out, researchers found that a surface layer of peroxide significantly enhanced CuO reducibility in favor of H2 oxidation. They also found that, on the other hand, it acted as an inhibitor to suppress CuO reduction against CO (carbon monoxide) oxidation. They found that this opposite effect of the peroxide on the two oxidation reactions stems from the modification of the surface sites where the reaction takes place.By finding these bonding sites and learning how they promote or inhibit oxidation, scientists can use these gases to gain more control of how these reactions play out. In order to tune these reactions though, scientists had to get a clear look at what was happening.                Binding energy and location of peroxide (OO) formation on Copper Oxide (CuO). Credit: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)             The right tools for the jobStudying this reaction in situ was important to the team, since peroxides are very reactive and these changes happen fast. Without the right tools or environment, it's hard to catch such a limited moment on the surface.Peroxide species on copper surfaces were never observed using in-situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy in the past. With this technique, researchers use infrared radiation to get a better understanding of a material's chemical properties by looking at the way the radiation is absorbed or reflected under reaction conditions. In this experiment, scientists were able to differentiate \"species\" of peroxide, with very slight variations in the oxygen they were carrying, which would have otherwise been very hard to identify on a metal oxide surface.\"I got really excited when I was looking up the infrared spectra of these peroxide species on a surface and seeing that there weren't many publications. It was exciting that we could see these differences using a technique that's not widely applied to these kind of species,\" recalled Head.IR spectroscopy on its own wasn't enough to be sure though, which is why the team also used another spectroscopy technique called ambient pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). XPS uses lower energy X-rays to kick electrons out of the sample. The energy of these electrons gives scientists clues about the chemical properties of atoms in the sample. Having both techniques available through the CFN User Program was key to making this research possible.\"One of the things that we pride ourselves in is the instruments that we have and modified here,\" said Boscoboinik. \"Our instruments are connected, so users can move the sample in a controlled environment between these two techniques and study them in situ to get complementary information. In most other circumstances, a user would have to take the sample out to go to a different instrument, and that change of environment could alter its surface.\"\"A nice feature of CFN lies not only in its state-of-the-art facilities for science, but also the opportunities it provides to train young researchers,\" said Guangwen Zhou professor at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science's Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Materials Science program at Binghamton University. \"Each of the students involved have benefited from extensive, hands-on experience in the microscopy and spectroscopy tools available at CFN.\"This work was accomplished with the contributions of four Ph.D. students in Zhou's group: Yaguang Zhu and Jianyu Wang, the first co-authors of this paper, and Shyam Patel and Chaoran Li. All of these students are early in their career, having just earned their PhDs in 2022.Future findingsThe results of this study may apply to other types of reactions and other catalysts besides copper. These findings and the processes and techniques that led scientists there could find their ways into related research. Metal oxides are widely used as catalysts themselves or components in catalysts. Tuning peroxide formation on other oxides could be a way to block or enhance surface reactions during other catalytic processes.\"I'm involved in some other projects related to copper and copper oxides, including transforming carbon dioxide to methanol to use as a fuel for clean energy,\" said Head. \"Looking at these peroxides on the same surface that I use has the potential to make an impact on other projects using copper and other metal oxides.\" More information:Yaguang Zhu et al, Tuning the surface reactivity of oxides by peroxide species, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

  "text": "University of Toronto researchers are investigating exposure to second-hand\u2014and even third-hand\u2014marijuana smoke in homes, including the THC that can collect on floors and surfaces.          The researchers, in Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering, have published a new study that models how THC\u2014the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis\u2014behaves and transforms once it is released in an indoor environment. The study is published in the journal Environmental Science: Atmospheres.The model enables researchers to explore mitigation strategies that could reduce involuntary exposure levels.\"We began our research on tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive part of cannabis that causes intoxication, because when we looked at second- and third-hand smoke, we started to see how much involuntary exposure happens,\" says Amirashkan Askari, a Ph.D. candidate in department of chemical engineering and applied chemistry.Askari co-authored the study with U of T Engineering Associate Professor Arthur Chan and Frank Wania, a professor in the department of physical and environmental sciences at U of T Scarborough.Between April 2021 and March 2022, Canadians spent $4 billion on regulated, adult-use cannabis, according to Statistics Canada. Dried cannabis accounted for 71.1 percent of sales, indicating that smoking is the most popular method of consumption.\"Any type of smoking, whether it is tobacco or cannabis, leaves behind a suite of pollutants that can remain in homes,\" says Chan. \"We now have sufficient chemical knowledge about THC to model its behavior in a typical indoor environment.\"Moreover, involuntary THC exposure can continue long after smoking has ceased. This is due to THC's large and complex chemical structure, which has a strong tendency to stick to surfaces and create third-hand exposure,\" says Askari.\"There are a lot of surfaces indoors\u2014tables, chairs and floors. When you calculate the ratio of surfaces to volume, it is quite elevated compared to the outdoors,\" he says. \"So, when a pollutant is emitted, it always has the chance to migrate from air to surfaces.\"Involuntary exposure to pollutants starts to become more important when we consider infants and children who reside in homes where this smoking takes place. Children tend to touch surfaces more than adults as they crawl or play; they are also known to frequently put their hands or objects in their mouth.\"      Askari used a time-dependent indoor mass-balance model to forecast the level of human exposure to THC. The study also examined the effectiveness of mitigating strategies\u2014from air purifiers to surface cleaners\u2014in reducing second- and third-hand exposure from marijuana smoke.The model was run for one simulated year under the assumption that THC from single-stream smoke (the lighted end) of a burning cannabis cigarette was emitted into the indoor air for one hour daily.By modeling the exposure level of an adult and a toddler (who were distinguished by body weight) Askari predicted that residents of all ages who are present during smoking sessions are vulnerable to high levels of involuntary second-hand THC.The exposure analysis also found that carpet and flooring materials were significant reservoirs of THC that migrated from air to surface. Since younger children are prone to object mouthing\u2014a common part of infant and toddler development\u2014this makes them especially sensitive to THC from third-hand exposure. These results, the study concludes, highlight the importance of preventing children from accessing spaces where cannabis smoking takes place, both during and after smoking.\"When it comes to improving indoor air quality, the best way to degrade air pollutants is to shut down the source,\" says Askari. \"But if our aim is to suppress it, we found the most effective measures were strategies that target the air particles directly. So, if you have an air purifier unit that filters particulate matter from the air, that will reduce that exposure significantly.\"While the researchers' initial study used computer simulation, the second phase of this cannabis and indoor air pollution research involves experiments in collaboration with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH).\"We had volunteers come in and either smoke or vape cannabis,\" says Askari. \"We measured the composition of air in real time\u2014while they were consuming the cannabis\u2014so we could see what happens to the air quality. We also did comparisons between smoking and vaping.\"The results from this second study have not been published, but the team hopes this research will help individuals and policymakers better understand how this source of indoor air pollution impacts the health of communities.\"We hope that people will start paying more attention to indoor air quality, not just during these high-emitting activities, but also long after they are over,\" Chan says. \"Keeping our homes well-ventilated is very effective at lowering our exposures, even if it is just for a brief period of time during and after smoking.\" More information:Amirashkan Askari et al, Modeling the fate and involuntary exposure to tetrahydrocannabinol emitted from indoor cannabis smoking, Environmental Science: Atmospheres (2023).

  "answer_squad": " DFNS/TiO2-Cu10",
  "text": "The heavy use of fossil fuels for driving industrial processes and human activities has resulted in increasingly excessive emissions of anthropogenic CO2 into our atmosphere, surpassing the 400 ppm level. This exceedingly high concentration of atmospheric CO2 has led to a series of negative consequences for our planet's climate system. However, CO2 can be a strategic carbon resource for synthesizing valued chemicals and fuels.          There have been numerous reports of noble metal catalysts, but their application was limited due to their moderate catalytic performance and high cost. In the non-noble metal catalyst family, Cu-based catalysts are among the most versatile, with good potential in many industrial processes. Unfortunately, the low Tammann temperature of copper and the resulting surface migration causes nanoparticles to sinter during the reaction, limiting their activity and long-term stability.In this work, a team of researchers led by Prof. Vivek Polshettiwar at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, asked the question, how to improve the catalytic activity and stability of Cu-catalyst using the concept of strong metal support interactions (SMSI) and defect sites cooperativity?They reported a catalyst with active copper sites loaded on titanium oxide-coated dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS/TiO2-Cu) for CO2 to CO conversion. The fibrous morphology and high surface area of DFNS/TiO2 allowed better dispersion and high loading of Cu NPs active sites.This catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance for CO2 reduction with CO productivity of 5350 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121 (i.e., 53506 mmol gCu\u22121 h\u22121), superior to all copper-based thermal catalysts. Notably, DFNS/TiO2-Cu10 showed 99.8% selectivity towards CO and was stable for at least 200 hours. The defect-controlled strong metal-support interactions between Cu and TiO2 kept the copper nanoparticles firmly anchored on the surface of the support and imparted excellent catalyst stability.The EELS studies, in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, density functional theory calculations, and long-term stability indicated that there was a strong interaction between copper sites and the Ti3+ sites,which ensured good stability and dispersion of the active copper sites. In-situ studies provided insights into the role of defect sites (Ti3+ and O-vacancies) in tuning SMSI.In-situ time-resolved Fourier transform infrared indicated that CO2 did not directly dissociate to form CO, while the in-situ Raman and in-situ UV-DRS study demonstrated that the intensity of the oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ centers gradually decreased after introducing CO2 gas into the reactor chamber and progressively increased when exposed to hydrogen. This indicated that CO2 to CO conversion followed a redox pathway assisted by hydrogen.Excellent catalytic performance of DFNS/TiO2-Cu and in-situ mechanistic studies indicated the potential of defects in tuning the strong metal-support interactions. This approach may lead to the design of catalytic systems using various active sites and defective supports.The paper is published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

  "answer_race": " To inform readers of cocoa beans' contamination.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the team that worked on the cocoa beans?",
  "answer_squad": " BESSY II",
  "text": "Cocoa beans can absorb toxic heavy metals such as cadmium from the soil. Some cultivation areas, especially in South America, are polluted with these heavy metals, in some cases considerably. In combining different X-ray fluorescence techniques, a team at BESSY II has now been able to non-invasively measure for the first time where cadmium accumulates exactly in cocoa beans: Mainly in the shell.          The work is published in the journal Analytical Chemistry, and further investigations show that the processing of the cocoa beans can have a great influence on the concentration of heavy metals.People have been harvesting the beans of the cocoa bush for at least 5,000 years. They have learned to ferment, roast, grind and process the beans with sugar and fat to make delicious chocolates. Today, around 5 million tons of beans are on the market every year, coming from only a few growing areas in tropical regions.Chocolate is considered a soul food: amino acids such as tryptophan brighten the mood. Cocoa beans also contain anti-inflammatory compounds and valuable trace elements. However, cocoa plants also absorb toxic heavy metals if the soils are polluted, for example by mining, which can gradually poison groundwater and soils.An important question is, where exactly the heavy metals accumulate in the bean, whether rather in the shell or rather in the endosperm inside the bean. From the harvest to the raw material for chocolate, the beans undergo many steps of different treatments, which could possibly reduce the contamination. And ideally the treatment could be optimized in order to make sure that the heavy metals are reduced but the desirable trace elements are retained.Mapping the beans at BESSY IIA team led by Dr. Ioanna Mantouvalou (HZB) and Dr. Claudia Keil (TU Berlin/Toxicology) has now combined various imaging methods at the BAMline of BESSY II to precisely map the heavy metal concentrations in cocoa beans.They examined cocoa samples from a cultivation region in Colombia, which were contaminated with an average of 4.2 mg/kg cadmium. This is well above the European limits of 0.1-0.8 mg cadmium/kg in cocoa products.                Element distribution on a virtual section of a fermented cocoa bean using X-ray fluorescence CT. It is clearly visible that cadmium (Cd) is mainly found in the shell. Credit: HZB             The team worked with three different X-ray fluorescence techniques to examine the cocoa beans. Among other things, they developed a new analytical method for absorption correction when imaging with an X-ray color camera.\"There has been little understanding of how cadmium migrates from the soil through roots into the plant and where the element accumulates in the beans. Especially because it was not possible to precisely localize the cadmium content non-invasively,\" says Mantouvalou. Ph.D. students Frank F\u00f6rste (TU Berlin) and Leona Bauer (TU Berlin and HZB) carried out the experiments.Cadmium is particularly difficult to detect, explains Mantouvalou. This is because the cadmium signal, which produces the excitation of the outer electrons, lies exactly below the much stronger fluorescence signal of the element potassium, which occurs in higher concentrations in cocoa.\"We therefore excite a deeper electron shell of the cadmium atom, which is only possible with hard X-rays at the BAMLine,\" says Frank F\u00f6rste. \"This enabled us to map the cross-sections of cocoa beans with high resolution, and show that cadmium predominantly accumulates in the outer shell,\" says Leona Bauer.They also discovered interesting differences between beans before and after the roasting process. \"We were able to prove that roasting changes the element distribution in the beans,\" says Mantouvalou. The combination of the different experimental methods allows researchers for the first time to precisely measure the accumulation of cadmium. Further investigations could systematically explore how to improve the processing steps in order to minimize the exposure.

  "text": "JILA researchers have upgraded a breathalyzer based on Nobel Prize-winning frequency-comb technology and combined it with machine learning to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection with excellent accuracy in 170 volunteer subjects. Their achievement represents the first real-world test of the technology's capability to diagnose disease in exhaled human breath.          Their study on this topic was published in the Journal of Breath Research.Frequency comb technology has the potential to non-invasively diagnose more health conditions than other breath analysis techniques, while also being faster and potentially more accurate than some other medical tests. Frequency combs act as rulers for precisely measuring different colors of light, including the infrared light absorbed by biomolecules in a person's breath.Human breath contains more than 1,000 different trace molecules, many of which are correlated with specific health conditions. JILA's frequency comb breathalyzer identifies chemical signatures of molecules based on exact colors and amounts of infrared light absorbed by a sample of exhaled breath.Back in 2008, Jun Ye and colleagues at JILA demonstrated the world's first frequency comb breathalyzer, which measured the absorption of light in the near-infrared part of the optical spectrum. In 2021 they achieved a thousandfold improvement in detection sensitivity by extending the technique to the mid-infrared spectral region, where molecules absorb light much more strongly. This enables some breath molecules to be identified at the parts-per-trillion level where those with the lowest concentrations tend to be present.Credit: National Institute of Standards and TechnologyThe added benefit to this study was the use of machine learning. Machine learning\u2014a form of artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014processes and analyzes a massive, complex m\u00e9lange of data from all the breath samples as measured by 14,836 comb \"teeth,\" each representing a different color or frequency to create a predictive model to diagnose disease.\"Molecules increase or decrease in their concentrations when associated with specific health conditions. Machine learning analyzes this information, identifies patterns and develops reliable criteria we can use to predict a diagnosis,\" said Qizhong Liang, a graduate student in the Jun Ye group, who is lead author of a new paper presenting the findings.JILA is jointly operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder). The research was conducted on breath samples collected from 170 CU Boulder students and staff from May 2021 to January 2022. Approximately half of the volunteers tested positive for COVID-19 with standard PCR tests. The other half of the subjects tested negative. The young study group had a median age of 23 years old, and all were above 18 years old. The general campus population was more than 90% vaccinated.Credit: National Institute of Standards and Technology\"I do think that this comb technique is superior to anything out there,\" NIST/JILA Fellow Jun Ye said. \"The basic point is not just the detection sensitivity, but the fact that we can generate a far greater amount of data, or breath markers, really establishing a whole new field of 'comb breathomics' with the help of AI. With a database, we can then use it to search and study many other physiological conditions for human beings and to help advance the future of healthcare.\"The JILA comb breathalyzer method demonstrated excellent accuracy for detecting COVID by using machine learning algorithms on absorption patterns to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. H2O (water), HDO (semi-heavy water), H2CO (formaldehyde), NH3 (ammonia), CH3OH (methanol), and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) were identified as discriminating molecules for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The team measured the accuracy of their results by creating a data graph comparing their predictions of COVID-19 against the PCR test results (which, it should be noted, have high but not perfect accuracy). On the graph, they computed a quantity known as the \"area under the curve\" (AUC). An AUC of 1, for example, would be expected for perfectly discriminating between ambient air and exhaled breath. An AUC of 0.5 would be expected for making random guesses on whether the individuals were born on odd or even months. The researchers measured an AUC of 0.849 for their COVID-19 predictions. An AUC of 0.8 or greater for medical diagnostic data is considered \"excellent\" accuracy.Credit: National Institute of Standards and TechnologyIn the future, the researchers could further increase the accuracy by expanding the spectral coverage, analyzing the patterns with more powerful AI techniques, and measuring and analyzing additional molecules, which could include the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself. Researchers would need to build a database of the specific IR colors absorbed by the virus (its spectral \"fingerprint\") to potentially measure viral concentrations in the breath.The researchers also identified significant differences in breath samples based on tobacco use and a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms such as lactose intolerance. This suggests broader capability of the technique for diagnosing different sets of diseases.The researchers plan further studies to try to diagnose other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the third-leading cause of death worldwide according to the World Health Organization. The researchers have also recently boosted the comb breathalyzer's diagnostic power by expanding the spectral coverage to detect additional molecules. They plan to employ additional AI approaches such as deep learning to improve its disease-detection abilities. Efforts are already under way to miniaturize and simplify the technology to make it portable and easy to use in hospitals and other care settings.Credit: National Institute of Standards and TechnologyYe said there is interest from the medical community in seeing the comb breathalyzer developed further and commercialized. Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be needed before the technology could be used in medical settings.The most prevalent analytical technique in breath research now is gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry, which can detect hundreds of exhaled molecules but works slowly, typically requiring tens of minutes. Its use of chemical process also unavoidably alters breath components and presents analytical challenges to identify breath profiles accurately. Frequency comb technology measures breath molecules in a non-destructive and real time manner and can promote a more accurate and repeatable determination of exhaled breath contents.

  "text": "Renewable-energy-powered electrochemical CO or CO2 reduction reactions (CO(2)RR) is one of the most promising strategies to upgrade CO2 to valuable products. A key question and bone of contention is whether any surface or subsurface oxygen remains on the electrocatalysts under the reducing CO(2)RR conditions, and if so, whether that oxygen play any role in facilitating the reaction.       Thermodynamically, the oxides are expected to be reduced to the metallic form under the CO(2)RR conditions according to the Pourbaix diagram. However, multiple experimental studies report evidence for oxygen-containing species on electrocatalysts at CO(2)RR conditions, which could be attributed either to the difference in reaction and characterization conditions, or to the distinct thermodynamic stabilities of surface and bulk oxides.This mini-review led by Prof. Bingjun Xu (College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University) summarizes recent literature on this topic and discusses the possible sources of oxygen-containing species at or near the electrode-electrolyte interfaces under CO(2)RR conditions.Potential (sub)surface oxygen-containing species are grouped into three main categories based on the conditions at which they are introduced: (1) via the exposure to ambient air; (2) via the pretreatment of the catalyst; and (3) with the assistance of additional oxygen sources via in-situ redox reactions.Potential impact of oxygen-containing species on the activity and product distribution in the CO(2)RR, and the perspectives on future efforts to reveal the identity and role of oxygen-containing species in the CO(2)RR are also discussed.The findings are published in the journal Science China Chemistry.

  "text": "New research from a team of scientists at the Cornell University Center for Bright Beams has made significant strides in developing new techniques to guide the growth of materials used in next-generation particle accelerators.          The study, published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry C, reveals the potential for greater control over the growth of superconducting Nb3Sn films, which could significantly reduce the cost and size of cryogenic infrastructure required for superconducting technology.Superconducting accelerator facilities, such as those used for X-ray free-electron laser radiation, rely on niobium superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities to generate high-energy beams. However, the associated cryogenic infrastructure, energy consumption, and operating costs of niobium SRF cavities limit access to this technology.To address this issue, researchers have been working to identify superconducting materials that can operate at temperatures higher than 2 Kelvin with comparable quality factors to niobium (Nb) SRF cavities. One of the most promising materials is triniobium tin (Nb3Sn), an alloy with an operating temperature of 18 Kelvin, thus reducing the need for expensive cryogenic infrastructure.Despite theoretical and experimental advancements in the performance of Nb3Sn-coated cavities, there is still a need for a thorough understanding of how to grow higher quality Nb3Sn alloy films.\"Nb3Sn cavities are going to be the accelerators of the future,\" says Ritchie Patterson, the Helen T. Edwards Professor of Physics in the College of Arts and Sciences and director of the Center for Bright Beams. \"Advancing this science is only made possible through diverse collaborations\u2014an important focus at the heart of CBB. The expertise and close collaborations between all of our partner institutions are driving this research into the future.\"                The metal deposition chamber. Credit: Cornell University             This new CBB research, conducted by experimental materials chemists at the University of Chicago coupled with theoretical physicists at the University of Florida, delivers the first atomic-scale images of Sn on oxidized niobium, depicting the early stages of Nb3Sn formation. This visualization of Sn adsorption and diffusion on oxidized niobium is an essential advancement in creating a mechanistic formula for optimizing the fabrication of next generation accelerator cavities.      \"The quality and accelerating performance of Nb3Sn depends on many convoluted variables at play during the growth procedure,\" says Sarah Willson, CBB graduate student at the University of Chicago and co-lead author of the paper along with postdoctoral scholar Rachael Farber. \"We are aiming to look at the initial steps of a complicated growth process and isolate certain variables in a controlled setting.\" Their atomic-level growth experiments are supported by quantum theory from graduate student Ajinkya Hire.As Nb3Sn accelerator cavities are prepared, scientists aim to reduce impurities and contaminants from the niobium cavity to achieve a cleaner and more uniform surface. The cavity is then heated to high temperatures in the presence of an Sn vapor. This causes the Sn to diffuse into the Nb layer, forming Nb3Sn. As careful measures are taken to grow a pristine Nb3Sn film, looking closely across the cavity reveals a highly disordered, rough, polycrystalline surface\u2014not the consistent single-crystal surface ideal for a highly controlled experiment.Willson explains that in order to conduct this experiment, they recreate, in a way, the real-world process of cavity-making, but further surpass the temperature demands needed\u2014heating the materials to 1630 degrees Celsius, and creating an atomically-flat niobium oxide surface to showcase the interactions of Sn, Nb, and O at the atomic level.Observations of metal oxides are routinely performed using scanning tunneling microscopy, STM, revealing information at the atomic scale. However, the specific setup for studying Nb3Sn growth with STM is not readily available. So, Willson and Farber created one.They designed and built a custom metal deposition chamber to deposit the Sn on the niobium surface. This technique recreates the real-world environment in which accelerator cavities are developed\u2014with the ability to prevent surface contamination\u2014while allowing researchers to study the deposition using STM.

  "text": "A steric hindrance regulation strategy was developed to predictably synthesize broadband white-light-emitting perovskites. This study was led by Prof. Jun Xing (College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Qingdao University of Science & Technology) and Prof. Weigao Xu (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University).       The authors reveal the effect of molecular configuration on the structural distortion of perovskites and pioneer a steric hindrance regulation strategy to predictably synthesize broadband white-light-emitting perovskites. Typically, the spacing molecules containing C-C(-NH2)-C group were applied to synthesize 2D perovskites, which bring large steric hindrance in the in-plane orientation and induce structural distortion.The degree of structural distortion in the perovskite could be regulated by controlling the C-C(-NH2)-C bond angle of the molecule, which determines the free excitons self-trapping. The synthesized perovskites exhibit tunable broadband emission covering from 400 to 800 nm, and the bigger molecular steric hindrance induces the larger structural distortion and the higher rate of excitons self-trapping, which therefore results in cool- to warm-white-light.According to this strategy, the functional molecules can be extended to secondary and tertiary amines with group C-NHx-C, and 40 kinds of perovskites with broadband emission were successfully fabricated. This work opens a general way to the directed synthesis of abundant white-light-emitting perovskites and uncovers the molecular steric hindrance-structural distortion-STEs relationship in the perovskites.The paper is published in the journal Science China Chemistry.

  "answer_squad": " Chitosan",
  "text": "An international interdisciplinary team of researchers from India, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand has successfully developed a method of using chitosan from terrestrial insects to manufacture eco\u2010friendly polymer composite parts using the 3D printing method.          3D printing is a form of additive manufacturing technology that is becoming increasingly popular in recent times due to its ability to produce complex shapes and geometries that were difficult to achieve using traditional manufacturing techniques. As a result, the demand for raw material for 3D printing is on the rise. It is crucial to ensure responsible usage of raw materials for 3D printing to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12, i.e., promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns.Chitosan is a natural biopolymer that is derived from chitin, a polysaccharide found in the exoskeletons of arthropods such as insects, as well as in sea creatures such in the shells of crabs. Terrestrial insects are a potential source of chitosan due to their abundance, accessibility, and relatively high chitin content in their exoskeletons. There are several potential benefits to extracting chitosan from terrestrial insects, including sustainable and eco-friendly production.Insects are a sustainable source of chitosan, as they can be easily farmed and harvested in large quantities without contributing to environmental pollution. In contrast, traditional sources of chitosan such as shrimp and crab shells can be unsustainable and have negative environmental impacts. However, how best to use chitin and chitosan materials derive from terrestrial insects remains debatable.This study has investigated the feasibility of developing an environmentally friendly composite material using 3D printing technology. The study found that the addition of chitin and chitosan, derived from terrestrial insects, to the PLA matrix led to a decrease in strength and stiffness, which worsened with increasing concentrations of chitin and chitosan. The composite material with 0.5 wt% chitin reinforcement had the lowest tensile and flexural strength compared to other composites produced using additive manufacturing.The reduction in strength and stiffness of the chitin/PLA and chitosan/PLA composites, in comparison to neat PLA, was attributed to the decreased interfacial bonding between the reinforcement and matrix. This resulted in polymeric slippage when the composite was subjected to an external load. However, the chitin/PLA and chitosan/PLA composites demonstrated enhanced ductility relative to neat PLA, with the 0.1 wt% chitin composite showing the highest ductility. It was concluded that chitin and chitosan could contribute to toughening the PLA composite.The study also found that the density of the composites increased with increasing concentrations of chitin and chitosan. FTIR and XRD analyses confirmed the crystalline and chemical bonding nature of the composite samples. Microstructural examination showed voids and impurity-like particles associated with chitin and chitosan decomposition in the composites. The Chitin/PLA and Chitosan/PLA composites exhibited good thermal stability, and could have potential applications for food product packaging based on their compressive properties.Further research is needed to investigate interfacial bonding and post-treatment processes to improve the mechanical characteristics of the composites and scalability of the method for industrial production. One thing for sure, using the chitosan (chitin) derived from terrestrial insects as a material for making filaments for 3D printing of parts could lend to a low carbon way of meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12, i.e., promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns.

  "text": "A chemical analyst and expert in micro-extraction at The University of Toledo created a more reliable, robust and efficient way to monitor pesticide exposure and help protect the health and safety of agricultural workers, especially for emerging sectors like the cannabis industry.          Dr. Emanuela Gionfriddo, an assistant professor of analytical chemistry, and Nipunika H. Godage, a Ph.D. candidate in UToledo's Dr. Nina McClelland Laboratory for Water Chemistry and Environmental Analysis, published research in the journal Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry outlining their groundbreaking method that is able to detect 79 pesticide residues in human blood plasma at \"ultra-trace\" levels, or parts per trillion.\"This has the potential to be applied to human exposure studies for the general public such as exposure through food or contaminated water but, most importantly, agricultural workers who have a higher potential for acute exposure to these toxic chemicals, which typically occurs through the skin, with pesticides then passing into the bloodstream and circulating through the body,\" Gionfriddo said.Pesticides are widely used in farming to prevent or reduce produce losses caused by pests and improve the quality of fruits and vegetables, but human exposure during mixing or application has been reported to cause neurological disorders, poisoning, cancer, reproductive disruptions, respiratory problems and chronic kidney diseases among farm workers.Though pesticides are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Gionfriddo said the legalization of cannabis recently in several states has led to \"inexperienced\" farmers being exposed to the harmful chemicals since those workers are less familiar with pesticide safety equipment and procedures as well as proper pesticide storage and handling.The pesticides selected for her study are the most commonly used pesticides during cannabis cultivation.Gionfriddo's new testing method uses what's called bio solid-phase microextraction with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.\"To meet the growing demands of regulatory agencies and routine analysis laboratories, sample throughput and method tunability is critical,\" Gionfriddo said. \"Using automated samplers, the preparation time per sample is 1.7 minutes.\"And as occupational exposure to pesticides can occur at varying concentration levels, it is important for any method to quantify pesticides at low concentrations. The new testing method demonstrated higher sensitivity, precision and accuracy and a drastic reduction in abnormalities compared to the commonly used approach, known as QuEChERS, which stands for Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe but can be labor intensive with prolonged workflows.Last week during National Farmworker Awareness Week, the U.S. EPA said pesticide exposure doesn't only happen when working in the fields. The federal agency said pesticide take-home exposure can occur when farm workers go home bearing pesticide residues that may cling to their skin, clothing, hats, boots, tools, lunch coolers or other items in their work environment. Their children may then be exposed to these pesticide residues.\"Assessing pesticide exposure quickly and thoroughly is crucial for the health and safety of workers and their families, to correct malpractices in pesticide storage and application, and to prevent further exposure,\" Godage said. \"Our new method can extract and analyze simultaneously a wide variety of pesticides from human plasma.\" More information:Nipunika H.

  "text": "In an advance they consider a breakthrough in computational chemistry research, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison chemical engineers have developed model of how catalytic reactions work at the atomic scale. This understanding could allow engineers and chemists to develop more efficient catalysts and tune industrial processes\u2014potentially with enormous energy savings, given that 90% of the products we encounter in our lives are produced, at least partially, via catalysis.          Catalyst materials accelerate chemical reactions without undergoing changes themselves. They are critical for refining petroleum products and for manufacturing pharmaceuticals, plastics, food additives, fertilizers, green fuels, industrial chemicals and much more.Scientists and engineers have spent decades fine-tuning catalytic reactions\u2014yet because it's currently impossible to directly observe those reactions at the extreme temperatures and pressures often involved in industrial-scale catalysis, they haven't known exactly what is taking place on the nano and atomic scales. This new research helps unravel that mystery with potentially major ramifications for industry.In fact, just three catalytic reactions\u2014steam-methane reforming to produce hydrogen, ammonia synthesis to produce fertilizer, and methanol synthesis\u2014use close to 10% of the world's energy.\"If you decrease the temperatures at which you have to run these reactions by only a few degrees, there will be an enormous decrease in the energy demand that we face as humanity today,\" says Manos Mavrikakis, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at UW\u2013Madison who led the research. \"By decreasing the energy needs to run all these processes, you are also decreasing their environmental footprint.\"Mavrikakis and postdoctoral researchers Lang Xu and Konstantinos G. Papanikolaou along with graduate student Lisa Je published news of their advance in the April 7, 2023 issue of the journal Science.In their research, the UW\u2013Madison engineers develop and use powerful modeling techniques to simulate catalytic reactions at the atomic scale. For this study, they looked at reactions involving transition metal catalysts in nanoparticle form, which include elements like platinum, palladium, rhodium, copper, nickel, and others important in industry and green energy.      According to the current rigid-surface model of catalysis, the tightly packed atoms of transition metal catalysts provide a 2D surface that chemical reactants adhere to and participate in reactions. When enough pressure and heat or electricity is applied, the bonds between atoms in the chemical reactants break, allowing the fragments to recombine into new chemical products.\"The prevailing assumption is that these metal atoms are strongly bonded to each other and simply provide 'landing spots' for reactants. What everybody has assumed is that metal-metal bonds remain intact during the reactions they catalyze,\" says Mavrikakis. \"So here, for the first time, we asked the question, 'Could the energy to break bonds in reactants be of similar amounts to the energy needed to disrupt bonds within the catalyst?'\"According to Mavrikakis's modeling, the answer is yes. The energy provided for many catalytic processes to take place is enough to break bonds and allow single metal atoms (known as adatoms) to pop loose and start traveling on the surface of the catalyst. These adatoms combine into clusters, which serve as sites on the catalyst where chemical reactions can take place much easier than the original rigid surface of the catalyst.Using a set of special calculations, the team looked at industrially important interactions of eight transition metal catalysts and 18 reactants, identifying energy levels and temperatures likely to form such small metal clusters, as well as the number of atoms in each cluster, which can also dramatically affect reaction rates.Their experimental collaborators at the University of California, Berkeley, used atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to look at carbon monoxide adsorption on nickel (111), a stable, crystalline form of nickel useful in catalysis. Their experiments confirmed models that showed various defects in the structure of the catalyst can also influence how single metal atoms pop loose, as well as how reaction sites form.Mavrikakis says the new framework is challenging the foundation of how researchers understand catalysis and how it takes place. It may apply to other non-metal catalysts as well, which he will investigate in future work. It is also relevant to understanding other important phenomena, including corrosion and tribology, or the interaction of surfaces in motion.\"We're revisiting some very well-established assumptions in understanding how catalysts work and, more generally, how molecules interact with solids,\" Mavrikakis says.Manos Mavrikakis is Ernest Micek Distinguished Chair, James A. Dumesic Professor, and Vilas Distinguished Achievement Professor in Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. Other authors include Barbara A.J. Lechner of the Technical University of Munich, and Gabor A. Somorjai and Miquel Salmeron of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley.

  "text": "Researchers have developed a novel synthetic substance that has the potential to be a more effective and safer way of delivering drugs around the body.          Currently, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the most commonly used polymer for biomedical applications due to its non-toxicity and high solubility. It has many applications, including coating nanocarriers which ferry pharmaceuticals in a patient's bloodstream.While PEGs have a vast number of benefits, there are also significant shortcomings. Currently, researchers have concerns over PEG's own immunogenicity, so their tendency to trigger an unwanted immune response against themselves. The widespread use of PEG in COVID-19 vaccines and boosters has led to significantly higher levels of PEG-antibodies found in vaccinated people.A team of scientists has created a new \"active stealth\" polymer, called Polythio Glycidyl glycerol (PTGG), which initial data suggests is safer and more effective in drug-delivery.The study, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS), found PTGG was less likely to be detected by immune systems when traveling around a body compared to PEG. It also enhanced physical stability and protected tissue from oxidative and inflammatory damage.Lead author, Dr. Farah El Mohtadi from the University of Portsmouth's School of Pharmacy & Biomedical Sciences, said, \"PTGG's 'active-stealth' character makes it a highly promising alternative to PEG for delivering drugs, and therapeutic proteins.\"Not only can it effectively avoid detection in the bloodstream, the polymer's advantageous properties can also significantly reduce the need for expensive substances to prevent freeze-damage during storage.\"The study's findings have significant implications for the development of more effective and safer drugs and nanocarriers. Further research will be conducted to explore the potential applications of PTGG in clinical settings.\"On top of the medical application, we also want to explore PTGG's potential use in other areas,\" added Dr. El Mohtadi.\"These include temporarily uniting the polymer to enzymes and exploring whether they are more effective at breaking down man-made materials, including plastics.\"The potential for using the polymer to stabilize nylon-degrading enzymes will be explored as part of a Ph.D. studentship at the University's Center for Enzyme Innovation (CEI), a project supervised by Professor Andy Pickford (the CEI Director), Dr. El Mohtadi and Dr. Bruce Lichtenstein.CEI scientists have already developed enzyme technology to reduce single use plastics, including PET, to their chemical building blocks, leading to safe and energy efficient recycling. Now they have set their sights on creating a similar process for polyester textiles, and for this project targeting nylon.Professor Andy Pickford said, \"In an industrial setting, plastic-degrading enzymes must operate under challenging conditions such as high temperature, so we are excited to see whether attaching PTGG to them can enhance their performance.\" More information:Richard d'Arcy et al, A Reactive Oxygen Species-Scavenging 'Stealth' Polymer, Poly(thioglycidyl glycerol), Outperforms Poly(ethylene glycol) in Protein Conjugates and Nanocarriers and Enhances Protein Stability to Environmental and Biological Stressors, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2022).

  "answer_squad": " electronic biosensor",
  "text": "A team of researchers has developed an electronic biosensor based on DNA aptamers that can detect biomarkers in whole blood samples without the addition of reagents. As the team explains in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition, the DNA aptamers recognize marker proteins as efficiently as antibodies do, but are easier to prepare and more adaptable. The biosensor was able to detect clinically relevant levels of a marker protein for cardiovascular disease without any further sample preparation.          Researchers aim to develop diagnostic tools that can detect disease biomarkers directly, reliably, and in the field, without the need to send samples to specialized laboratories for analysis. Shana O. Kelley of the University of Toronto, Canada, and Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, U.S., and her team have developed a simple chip-based device to detect marker proteins in complex samples using chronoamperometric measurements.Their nanoscale sensor system works as a molecular \"pendulum\": it measures the extra load a protein places on the pendulum, which consists of a strand of DNA tethered to an electrode. The approach does not require any external reagents.Typically, antibodies are used to seek out and bind marker proteins in complex mixtures. However, antibodies are themselves proteins, and as such are quite complex to design and produce. Kelley and colleagues have now found that the smaller and simpler DNA aptamers can be used instead of antibodies. DNA aptamers are short synthetic fragments of with specific shapes and structures. They are relatively easy to make and, with customizable structures, cheaper to produce than antibodies.Like antibodies, DNA aptamers can bind marker proteins through molecular and structural interactions, but they are easier to design. \"DNA has the most predictable and programmable interactions of any natural or synthetic molecule,\" explain Kelley and her team. To develop an aptamer-based sensor, they created a DNA aptamer that specifically detects B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a biomarker for cardiovascular disease, and linked this aptamer with the DNA pendulum strand tethered to the gold electrode to create the molecular pendulum sensor.The completed biosensor successfully detected BNP, even in complex mixtures such as unprocessed whole blood from cardiac patients. Because Kelley and colleagues found that the sensitivity of the aptamer-based system was as high as that of antibody-based detection, they suggest further research and use of DNA aptamers for laboratory-independent diagnostics.

  "text": "A research team co-led by chemists from City University of Hong Kong (CityU) recently discovered novel, highly effective anticancer agents with tridimensional structures, which have high anticancer activity, low toxicity and the ability to overcome drug resistance in cancer cells. The findings help provide a new direction for anticancer drug development.          Cancer has long been a devastating disease, which affects millions of people worldwide. Despite advances in treatment, current anticancer drugs often have limited effectiveness, lack of cancer selectivity, serious side effects and drug resistance in cancer cells.\"The structure of drugs greatly affects their anticancer performance,\" explained Dr. Zhu Guangyu, Associate Professor in the Department of Chemistry at CityU. \"Most anticancer drugs have planar structures; developing new compounds with tridimensional structures may provide an opportunity to address the limitations of current anticancer drugs.\"In collaboration with researchers from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), the team tested a new class of tridimensional and chiral compounds, which exhibit promising anticancer activity and present action mechanisms that are distinct from conventional anticancer drugs to overcome drug resistance.The team first developed a new, highly efficient catalytic synthetic strategy to obtain a novel class of tridimensional and chiral tetraarylmethane compounds that presented better anticancer activity and lower toxicity than the clinical anticancer drug doxorubicin.In their experiments, the research team tested the compounds with cancer cells in vitro, using doxorubicin as a control. They found that the tetraarylmethane compounds were more cytotoxic to cancer cells, including lung cancer stem cells (LCSCs), which are notorious for their drug resistance to clinical chemotherapeutic drugs, causing treatment failure. The compound also exhibited better cancer cell selectivity as it caused less harm to normal living cells, suggesting lower toxicity.                The synthesized lead compounds induced necroptosis in lung cancer stem cells. The arrows indicate cell membrane permeabilization. Credit: Tan, X. et al. https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-022-00211-4             The team further analyzed the structure-activity relationship of synthesized compounds. They found that the presence of certain substituents, including halogen and hydroxyl groups, at certain positions of the tetraarylmethane compounds significantly improved their cytotoxicity to cancer cells.      Upon treatment with the synthesized compound, some cancer cells started to die, as organelle swelling, cell membrane permeabilization, nuclear shrinkage and fragmentation were observed. This suggests that necrotic cell death might have been triggered by the tetraarylmethane compounds.In the fight against cancer, the majority of anticancer drugs currently available rely on the activation of apoptotic pathways to eliminate cancer cells. However, a promising new avenue of research for reducing drug resistance lies in the development of novel anticancer agents that target alternative cell death pathways. In their experiments, the team found that these innovative compounds induced a different cell death pathway.This suggests that the compounds can bypass the resistance mechanisms generated by conventional drugs, making them highly desirable for further exploration in the field of cancer treatment.\"The satisfactory anticancer performance and unique mechanism make these compounds potential candidates for anticancer agents for further development,\" said Dr. Zhu. The team plans to synthesize more compounds and conduct further experiments to evaluate their anticancer performance.Their findings were published in Nature Synthesis.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the enzyme that Heterosigma uses to convert nitrate to ammonium?",
  "answer_squad": " nitrate reductase",
  "text": "Ever since it was discovered to be a driving force behind economically and environmentally destructive harmful algal blooms (HABs) throughout the world, researchers have been trying to discover more information about the effects of different types of nitrogen, such as nitrate or ammonium, on the proliferation of HABs.          At the University of Delaware, Kathyrn Coyne, associate professor in the School of Marine Science and Policy (SMSP), has spent several years studying HABs\u2014including Heterosigma akashiwo, a globally distributed toxic species of alga. About 10 years ago, with funds from Delaware Sea Grant (DESG), Coyne's lab discovered that Heterosigma akashiwo is able to use nitric oxide as a nitrogen source.It does this by using a unique modification of an enzyme called nitrate reductase. This enzyme typically catalyzes the first step in the process of converting nitrate to ammonium, a more useable form of nitrogen. The modification of nitrate reductase in Heterosigma akashiwo allows it to use nitric oxide instead of nitrate as a source of nitrogen.\"This kind of raised a lot of questions,\" Coyne said. \"Where would they be accessing nitric oxide in the environment? What kind of advantage does it give Heterosigma akashiwo to have this modification in their enzyme? And how do other types of nitrogen affect its ability to use nitric oxide?\"The last question was answered in a recent article about the results of the research in Scientific Reports.The lead author on this paper, Emily Healey, received her master's degree at UD in marine biosciences and is a doctoral student at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. Along with Coyne, other co-authors include Joanna York, professor in the School of Marine Science and Policy and Director of DESG, and Robinson Fulweiler, professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University, as well as past members of Coyne's lab, Stacie Flood and Patience Bock.REU participantHealey said that while she joined Coyne's lab as a master's student in the summer of 2019, she came to UD and worked with Coyne earlier as a participant in the SMSP Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) summer program.\"I have always been interested in microbiology and to have the opportunity to spend my summer at the beach through the REU program was pretty amazing,\" Healey said. \"Dr. Coyne runs a great lab. She had really helpful Ph.D. students working for her, and I just loved the work. I had never worked with algae before\u2014I had been doing more with bacteria so it was interesting to get immersed in a different microbe.\"After her REU experience, Healey was able to come back the next year to start her master's program. During that time, she began the research which would eventually lead to this recent publication.      Nitrate reductase Healey said one of the goals of her research was to see if other nitrogen sources affect the activity of nitrate reductase in Heterosigma akashiwo and its ability to take up nitric oxide. For example, if there is a lot of ammonium present in an environment from agricultural sources, most species will down-regulate the nitrate reductase enzyme, which might affect Heterosigma's ability to use nitric oxide.\"We thought if there's a lot of ammonium, maybe Heterosigma akashiwo isn't able to use nitric oxide as a source of nitrogen,\" said Healey. \"Maybe if there's ammonium present, they simply turn off that enzyme.\"By shutting off the enzyme in the presence of ammonium, the possibility existed that Heterosigma akashiwo would be inhibited or even prevented from accessing nitric oxide and turning it into biomass.What they found, however, was that even when there was ammonium present, providing nitric oxide to cultures of Heterosigma akashiwo actually increased activity of the enzyme so that it was able to successfully take up nitric oxide and convert it to biomass in the presence of ammonium.To determine the effects of different types of nitrogen on nitrate reductase, the researchers conducted three experiments. They grew Heterosigma akashiwo in the lab first with only nitrate, then with only ammonium, and finally with a 50/50 mix of nitrate and ammonium.In each of the experiments, the activity of the enzyme nitrate reductase not only increased when nitric oxide was added, but results showed that Heterosigma was incorporating nitric oxide into biomass even in the presence of ammonium.Coyne said this ability potentially gives Heterosigma akashiwo an advantage over other species, by allowing them to access a novel source of nitrogen.\"If that were the case, then Heterosigma may be able to use nitric oxide as an alternative that other species simply don't have access to,\" said Coyne.Nitrogen in the sedimentsThis ability to use nitric oxide as a nitrogen source may have something to do with how Heterosigma akashiwo moves throughout the day\u2014as the species will move up to the surface of the water during the day and return to the bottom of the water column during the night.\"At night, Heterosigma migrates to the sediments and then during the day time, they're photosynthetic so they move up to the surface where they are exposed to sunlight,\" said Coyne. \"There is a lot of data showing that nitric oxide seeps up through the sediments in some coastal areas, so we think Heterosigma may be accessing that nitric oxide as a nitrogen source at night.\"Healey said this ability to use nitric oxide may have a few implications. One would be that it gives Heterosigma akashiwo an advantage over other algae when other types of nitrogen have been depleted.In addition, Healey said that nitric oxide should be considered a factor in bloom formation for Heterosigma akashiwo.\"People often study the effects of nitrogen on blooms and how to prevent blooms in the first place by reducing nitrate or ammonium,\" said Healey. \"Now, we're saying, 'Ok, add nitric oxide to that list because it could be important.'\" More information:Emily M.

  "text": "A new way of using 3D printing to create infection-fighting materials for use as medical implants has been revealed in a new research paper, published in Advanced Materials Technologies.          Engineers at the University of Bath, working with colleagues at the University of Ulster, have for the first time successfully created a new kind of ferroelectric composite material with antimicrobial properties using a novel multi-material 3D printing process.They say the use of electrically responsive ferroelectric materials gives the implants the infection-fighting properties, making them ideal for biomedical applications, such as heart valves, stents and bone implants, reducing the risk of infection for patients.Reducing riskWhile commonplace, all biomedical implants pose some level of risk as materials can carry surface bio-contaminants that can lead to infection. Reducing this risk could be beneficial both to patients in the form of improved outcomes, and to healthcare providers thanks to reduced costs incurred by ongoing treatment.The team has previously used this 3D printing technique for the fabrication of three-dimensional scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.Dr. Hamideh Khanbareh, a lecturer in materials and structures in Bath's Department of Mechanical Engineering, is lead author of the research. She says that the development has the scope for wide-ranging applications.She says, \"Biomedical implants that can fight infection or dangerous bacteria such as E. coli could present significant benefits to patients and to health care providers.\"Our research indicates that the ferroelectric composite materials we have created have a great potential as antimicrobial materials and surfaces. This is a potentially game-changing development that we would be keen to develop further through collaboration with medical researchers or health care providers.\"Infection-busting propertiesThe innovation comes thanks to ferroelectricity, a characteristic of certain polar materials that generate electrical surface charge in response to a change in mechanical energy or temperature. In ferroelectric films and implants, this electrical charge leads to the formation of free radicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which selectively eradicate bacteria. This comes about through the micro-electrolysis of water molecules on a surface of polarized ferroelectric composite material.The composite material used to harness this phenomenon is made by embedding ferroelectric barium calcium zirconate titanate (BCZT) micro-particles in polycaprolactone (PCL) a biodegradable polymer widely used in biomedical applications. The mixture of the ferroelectric particles and polymer is then fed into a 3D bioprinter to create a specific porous \"scaffold\" shape designed to have a high surface area to promote ROS formation.Testing showed that even when contaminated with high concentrations of aggressive E. coli bacteria, the composite can completely eradicate the bacteria cells without external intervention, killing 70% within just 15 minutes.

So researchers paired the strengths of \u00b5Map, the MacMillan Lab's proximity-labeling system introduced three years ago, with in nucleo protein trans-splicing, a protein engineering technology introduced in 2016 and optimized since by the Muir Lab.\"The whole point of \u00b5Map is to understand biology, broadly defined, in ways that you couldn't beforehand, because \u00b5Map gives you such incredibly precise information. This research is an example of doing precisely that,\" said David MacMillan, the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry and a recipient of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\"With this research, we saw that the biology is happening because of these mutations,\" he said. \"It was impossible to see that before, so we were driving in the dark. It's another piece in this whole wall, a brick of what \u00b5Map's going to be able to do. It's still just the beginning, but this is a true collaboration.\"The combination of these technologies allowed researchers to tether an iridium photocatalyst to a protein of interest to study these minute interactions and how they change in the presence of mutations\u2014all without impacting the complex microenvironment within the cell nucleus.The photocatalyst highlighted a radius of focus just one nucleosome wide, allowing researchers to peer into this microenvironment with unprecedented specificity.\"So many things in biology and disease come down to how chromatin moves and changes,\" said Ciaran Seath, a former postdoc in the MacMillan Lab and co-lead author on the paper with Antony Burton, a former postdoc in the Muir Lab. \"Viruses, aging, cancers, all the things we looked at, change how chromatin can move and react. We figured, if you could watch that, you could learn about all of these different problems in a modular way.\"Sometimes you can't see or predict all the other things that are likely to happen in the machine of the nucleus. Now that we have paired these tools, we can measure these unforeseen consequences. It's like touching a point on a spider's web,\" he said. \"You can see the whole thing move.\"Burton added, \"What the synergy of these technologies gets you, in a minimally perturbative way, is the ability to install a small catalyst onto a protein of interest and then map what's nearby. We were able to illuminate protein interactions and complex, downstream effects at a level of detail that is very hard to do with other methods.\"Most importantly, we can chart how these change as a function of mutation or drug treatment, presenting opportunities for academic and industrial application.\"The research was authored by Seath, now an assistant professor of chemistry at the Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology in Jupiter, Florida; Burton, now a senior scientist in chemical biology at AstraZeneca in Boston, Massachusetts; and senior scientists Thomas Muir, the Van Zandt Williams Jr. Class of 1965 Professor, and MacMillan.      Advancing the field of epigeneticsThe research has important implications for epigenetics, the branch of biology that explores changes in gene expression. At the heart of epigenetics are histone proteins, which package DNA and restrict access to the genome, thereby playing a key role in regulating transcription.Recently, mutations to these histone proteins have been discovered and linked to a wide range of cancers.\"One of the things we looked at was adding a mutation that occurs in a histone that's linked to cancer,\" said Muir. \"What we wanted to know is, what happens when that mutation is present; what can no longer be recruited, what's no longer in the neighborhood, what new things are brought in that shouldn't normally be there?\"We were able to use these technologies to find all sort of things that get changed when we put this mutation on the chromatin, things related to gene regulation,\" he added. \"We were able to infer mechanistic insights that relate to how genes get misregulated with a mutation.\"Beginning their research three years ago, the team hypothesized that the mutation associated with cancer precipitates some sort of loss of function. Biomolecules find chromatin and bind with it to leave a transcriptional mark. Researchers believed that the mutation blocked some of that action, thus leading to cell dysfunction.Their hypothesis was borne out with this research, which generated molecular detail on how a tiny change in the genome can lead to major impacts.

  "text": "Tom Stavert, a joint Ph.D. researcher between Sheffield and Strathclyde, has published an article in the journal RSC Sustainability exploring how combining computational modeling with green chemical principles can enable sustainable manufacture.          Novel research methods critical to the decarbonization of industry have been highlighted in a new paper published by a Sheffield-Strathclyde research team.Tom Stavert is a postgraduate researcher whose Ph.D. is a joint collaboration between the University of Sheffield and the University of Strathclyde, supervised by Prof. Siddharth Patwardhan and Dr. Miguel Jorge, respectively, who also contributed to the new paper alongside Dr. Robert Pilling.The focus of Tom's research is combining novel experimental and computational approaches to produce sustainable nanomaterials.His recent research has culminated in the publication of the article titled \"Unlocking the holy grail of sustainable and scalable mesoporous silica using computational modeling,\" in RSC Sustainability.Ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) has applications in the likes of gas separation, catalysis, drug delivery in patients, and biosensors\u2014the latter can be used for disease monitoring among other things.However, despite the discovery of OMS 30 years ago, it's not yet possible to produce such materials sustainably because they require high temperature and pressure, extreme pH, and harsh, toxic chemicals, as well as forming polluted water, making it a highly energy and resource intensive process.Bio-inspired methods offer a great alternative for the design of high-value mesoporous silica under more environmentally considerate conditions, allowing for both sustainable and economic scale up. However, at present, synthesis of bio-inspired silica (BIS) is not fully understood, which creates barriers to achieving products comparable in quality to traditional mesoporous silica.As such, this article summarizes key findings in the development of OMS and BIS synthesis, with focus on the challenges in the development of scalable routes for the production of these materials. It also highlights recent triumphs in improving the mechanistic understanding of syntheses using computational modeling, as well as how modeling can be used for the predictive design of BIS.Through combining computational modeling with the principles of green and sustainable chemistry, there is the potential to transform material discovery and sustainable manufacture. This approach can reduce production costs by two orders of magnitude in some cases.With OMS having a wide range of applications, future outcomes from this work align with multiple of the UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs): SDG 6\u2014clean water and sanitation, SDG 7\u2014affordable and clean energy, SDG 9\u2014industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG12\u2014responsible consumption and production, and SDG 13\u2014climate action.On his recent publication, Tom said, \"Being part of a collaborative Ph.D. project has given me a fantastic perspective of the importance of taking a multi-disciplinary approach to solving research challenges as it combines both experimental and computational methods.\"In this article we highlight how seemingly unrelated strands of research can be joined together to create novel and effective research methods, drawing on expertise from researchers with diverse skillsets. This combined approach will be critical to decarbonising industry and effectively tackling climate change.\" More information:Tom Stavert et al, Unlocking the holy grail of sustainable and scalable mesoporous silica using computational modelling, RSC Sustainability (2023).

  "text": "Woolen clothing has been around for as long as humans have been wearing clothes and sheep have been domesticated. Indeed, our distant ancestors used sheep for three things: food, clothing and shelter\u2014wool makes good insulation and helps to keep in the warmth.          The UK is still one of the largest wool producers in the world and has more than 60 different breeds of sheep.But with the rise of veganism, many people are now questioning whether it's ethical to use wool in clothing and fabrics. Vegans don't wear wool as it is often a by-product of the meat industry.This is why the charity PETA (The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has launched a US$1 million (\u00a3844,000) vegan wool challenge to find the first individual, group, or company that can create a vegan wool material that is \"visually, textually and functionally akin to or better than sheep's wool.\"But it seems that back in the 1940s, textile physicist William Astbury was already on the case and making newspaper headlines for wearing what would today be considered a vegan coat.For Astbury's jacket was woven not from wool or other conventional textile materials, but from Ardil, a fiber made from monkey nut, or peanut proteins.The monkey nut coatIn my book The Man in the Monkeynut Coat: William Astbury and How Wool Wove a Forgotten Road to the Double-Helix, I tell the story of Astbury (and that famous coat), who with his colleague Florence Bell laid the foundations for the discovery of the structure of DNA.Scientists James Watson and Francis Crick are famous for having first worked out the structure of DNA. But their success came 15 years after Astbury and Bell had first shown that X-rays could actually reveal DNA's structure.And this work had a surprising origin, for Astbury's aim was not to answer grand questions about the secrets of life, but to study the humble wool fiber while working as a lecturer in textile physics at the University of Leeds.Ever since the Middle Ages, wool and textiles were the economic lifeblood of this Yorkshire city\u2014with mills a major source of employment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.In 1928 Astbury came to Leeds and used X-rays to reveal the molecular shape of the proteins in wool fibers. He found that they could be compacted or elongated\u2014rather like a slinky toy. This change in their molecular architecture explained the stretchiness of wool\u2014a property that made it so attractive to the textile industry.And through it, Astbury left another powerful scientific legacy\u2014thanks to his sporting of that rather unusual \"peanut\" overcoat.      A future wool?From the mid-1930s onwards, Astbury, along with his collaborators Albert Chibnall and Kenneth Bailey, filed patents on a process that used solvents such as urea to unravel the precise 3D shape of proteins found in seeds\u2014like the peanut. Their method then refolded them by a kind of molecular origami into insoluble fibers, creating a cheap and abundant raw material for the textile industry.Sharing his optimism, the company Imperial Chemical Industries bought these patents and built a pilot production plant in Scotland to produce a new textile fiber from peanuts, which they called Ardil and gifted Astbury an overcoat made from it.During the second world war, wool shortages encouraged investment in Ardil and campaigns were launched to persuade the British public of its benefits. This drive to develop new textile fibers at the time may also have inspired a storyline in the 1951 British comedy film The Man in the White Suit.In the film, an altruistic chemist invents a fabric that resists wear and stain, but (spoiler alert) his dreams come crashing down when management realizes the fabric must be suppressed for economic reasons as it threatens their livelihoods.Unfortunately, much like the fictional fiber, Ardil did not live up to its promise of saving the British textile industry. But Astbury and his overcoat left an important scientific legacy.His work remains important because it showcased his lifelong belief that understanding living systems requires solving their molecular architecture. While Ardil did not succeed, Astbury's research laid the foundation for future innovations in molecular biology and materials science.This approach, known as structural biology, has since allowed us to understand how the blood protein hemoglobin can carry oxygen around the body, how muscles contract and more recently how the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV2 allows the virus to bind and enter human cells.When Astbury died in 1961, his friend and colleague, the botanist R.D. Preston, fondly remembered him as \"a man of many parts\u2014scientist, scholar, musician, bon viveur, humorist, in some ways, a swashbuckler\u2026boisterous to the end with every morning still a Christmas morning.\" Maybe to this list of accolades, we should also add a posthumous nomination for the $1 million vegan wool prize.

  "text": "To manage atmospheric carbon dioxide and convert the gas into a useful product, Cornell scientists have dusted off an archaic\u2014now 120 years old\u2014electrochemical equation. The group aims to thwart the consequences of global warming and climate change by applying this long-forgotten idea in a new way.          The calculation\u2014named the Cottrell equation for chemist Frederick Gardner Cottrell, who developed it in 1903\u2014can help today's researchers understand the several reactions that carbon dioxide can take when electrochemistry is applied and pulsed on a lab bench.Their work was published March 27 in the journal ACS Catalysis.\"For carbon dioxide, the better we understand the reaction pathways, the better we can control the reaction\u2014which is what we want in the long term,\" said lead author Rileigh Casebolt DiDomenico, a doctoral student in the Smith School of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, in Cornell Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Tobias Hanrath.The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide presents an opportunity to transform the gas from an environmental liability to a feedstock for chemical products or as a medium to store renewable electricity in the form of chemical bonds, as nature does.\"If we have better control over the reaction, then we can make what we want, when we want to make it,\" DiDomenico said. \"The Cottrell equation is the tool that helps us to get there.\"In simple terms, the equation depicts a change in the measured electrochemical current over specific references to time during an experiment. What that means in a lab is that carbon dioxide is subjected to various applied potentials stepped up or down, or pulsed and these, in turn, generate a current that is related to the products formed from the reduction of carbon dioxide.DiDomenico first encountered this antique equation as a doctoral student in a class taught by H\u00e9ctor Abru\u00f1a, the Emile M. Chamot Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, in the College of Arts and Sciences, a senior author on the paper.Intrigued after Abru\u00f1a mentioned it in class, DiDomenico implemented the Cottrell equation in her own work on carbon dioxide reduction. She changed the electrochemical values (such as applied potential) or the time scale, to generate other products derived from the gas.As an example, the equation enables a researcher to identify and control experimental parameters to take carbon dioxide and convert it into useful carbon products like ethylene, ethane or ethanol.      At first, DiDomenico thought she got strange results, but confirmed later that she had conducted the experiments correctly.\"I was trying to change the pulse profile to make ethylene specifically by applying what I was learning in class to see if it fit,\" DiDomenico said. \"I realized that this was actually a way that we could identify a mechanism for reducing carbon dioxide into a useful product.\"Many researchers today use advanced computational methods to provide a detailed atomistic picture of processes at the catalyst surface, but these methods often involve several nuanced assumptions, which complicate direct comparison to experiments, said senior author Tobias Hanrath, the Marjorie L. Hart '50 Professor in Engineering, in the Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.\"The magnificence of this old equation is that there are very few assumptions,\" Hanrath said. \"If you put in experimental data, you get a better sense of truth. It's an old classic. That's the part that I thought was beautiful.\"Abru\u00f1a enjoyed seeing the equation employed. \"This equation describes what happens when one imposes a potential step, so you go from one voltage to another, and then look at the resulting current transient,\" he said. \"By analyzing the results, you can derive interesting and important mechanistic information and details. It's just that unless you're an electrochemical nerd like me, you probably don't know much about that.\"People in the business of carbon dioxide reduction are much more into product distributions, or the engineering aspects of that,\" Abru\u00f1a said. \"Here we are using a very simple model that worked amazingly well. It's almost embarrassingly good.\"DiDomenico said, \"Because it is older, the Cottrell equation has been a forgotten technique. It's classic electrochemistry. Just bringing it back to the forefront of people's minds has been cool. And I think this equation will help other electrochemists to study their own systems.\" More information:Rileigh Casebolt DiDomenico et al, Mechanistic Insights into the Formation of CO and C2 Products in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction\u2500The Role of Sequential Charge Transfer and Chemical Reactions, ACS Catalysis (2023).

  "text": "An article published in the journal Cosmetics reports an investigation of the effects of including rosmarinic acid, an active antioxidant, in a sunscreen along with two conventional ultraviolet light filters, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (against UVB) and avobenzone (against UVA).          The research group increased the sunscreen's photoprotective efficacy by adding rosmarinic acid at 0.1%, a very small proportion compared with those of conventional UV filters. They believe their findings suggest that incorporating natural molecules with antioxidant activities into sunscreens could decrease the proportion of conventional UV filters in the final product, with the advantage of providing other functional properties.The product's performance improved without the need to increase active principle levels, reducing both the amount of sunscreen needed to protect the same skin area and the volume of synthetic chemicals discharged into the environment.In vitro and clinical trials obtained a 41% increase in sun protection factor (SPF). The higher the SPF, the more sunburn protection increases.Another advantage of including rosmarinic acid was the addition of antioxidant activity to photoprotection so that the product could be used in antiaging cosmetics, for example.\"Our research on photoprotective systems aims primarily to evaluate potential sunscreen enhancement strategies. We're interested above all in discovering ways to increase sunburn protection while also improving the stability of the product so that it remains safe and effective for longer,\" said pharmaceutical scientist and biochemist Andr\u00e9 Rolim Baby, last author of the article and a professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCF-USP) in Brazil.\"We're also looking for products or systems with less environmental impact and ways of reducing the concentration of conventional filters by including natural ingredients that enhance the formulation.

  "answer_squad": " CAS",
  "text": "Materials that can conduct negatively charged hydrogen atoms in ambient conditions could pave the way for advanced clean energy storage and electrochemical conversion technologies. A research team from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) demonstrated a technique that enables a room-temperature all-solid-state hydride cell by introducing and exploiting defects in the lattice structure of rare earth hydrides. Their study was published in Nature on April 5.          Solid materials that conduct lithium, sodium and hydrogen cations have been used in batteries and fuel cells. Under certain conditions, some of the materials transition to superionic states where ions move as fast as they do in liquids by skipping through the rigid crystal structure. This phenomenon is advantageous for chemical and energy conversions as it allows ions to move without a liquid or soft membrane to separate the electrodes. However, few solid-state materials can reach this state under ambient conditions.\"Materials that exhibit superionic conduction at ambient conditions would provide huge opportunities for constructing brand new all-solid-state hydride batteries, fuel cells and electrochemical cells for the storage and conversion of clean energy,\" said Prof. Chen Ping, study author from DICP.With strong reducibility and high redox potential, hydride ion (H\u2212) conductors have emerged as promising candidates for this technology. Several H\u2212 conductors have already been developed in recent years, including alkaline earth metal hydrides and oxyhydrides of alkaline earth and rare earth metals, which are known for fast hydrogen migration. But none of the materials developed could achieve superionic conduction at ambient conditions\u2014until the DICP team took a new approach.The DICP research team targeted the structure and morphology of trihydrides\u2014hyrdrides containing three atoms of hydrogen per molecule\u2014of certain rare earth elements (REHx), including Lanthanum (La).Strategies to enhance electronic conductivities typically seek to diminish crystallographic imperfections for applications like metallic nanowire interconnects and nanostructured photovoltaic semiconductors. In this study, however, the research team purposely created abundant discrete nanosized grains and lattice defects to disturb the path of electron transport in REHx and suppress the electronic conductivity. This is different from engineering conventional materials for ion conduction, which relies upon the consistent structure of high crystallinity.The research team observed how H\u2212 ions diffused easily in REHx lattices by hopping between octahedral and tetrahedral sites in the crystal and across interfaces or grain boundaries. Electrons, on the other hand, encountered substantial scattering at grain boundaries, particle surfaces and other traps, which brought down the electronic conductivities by three to five orders of magnitude from those of their well-crystallized counterparts.\"By creating nano-sized grains, defects and other crystalline mismatched zones in a known ionic-electronic mixed conductor, we demonstrated that the electronic conductivity of LaHx (x ' 2.94) can be largely suppressed by five orders of magnitude,\" said Chen. \"Engineering such a material could transform LaHx into a pure hydride ion conductor with record high conductivities in the temperature range of -40\u2103 to 80\u2103.\"The researchers effectively suppressed electron conduction of LaHx by decreasing the particle size and distorting the lattice via high-energy ball milling, which involves subjecting the material to high-energy collisions. With fast H\u2212 conduction and a high ion transfer number, the deformed LaHx material would enable a hydride ion battery to operate at room temperature or lower.\"This work demonstrates the effectiveness of lattice deformation in suppressing electron conduction in REHx,\" said Chen.The researchers plan to explore the physics underneath the phenomenon and extend the method developed in this study to other hydride materials to broaden the material scope for pure H\u2212 conductors.\"Our near-term goal is to demonstrate a brand new all-solid-state hydride ion battery that is of practical potential,\" said CHEN.

  "answer_squad": " Meotec GmbH",
  "text": "Researchers from IMDEA Materials Institute and German medical equipment manufacturer Meotec GmbH have developed the world's first industrially scalable surface modification process for bioabsorbable magnesium alloy wires.          The findings, as reported in two recently published scientific papers in the journal Biomaterials Advances, could have a significant impact in the future use of such wires for biomedical applications.Surface-modified magnesium wires offer enormous potential in the biomedical field, from use in implants, wound closure, cardiovascular stents, nerve regeneration, and as polymer reinforcement in trauma fixation plates.The two recently released publications outline how researchers created a novel technique for the fabrication and continuous surface modification of wires from WE43 magnesium alloy by means of Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO).By improving the surface resistance to corrosion, the new process allows scientists to overcome two of the greatest hurdles to the use of magnesium wires in biomedical implants: their quick rate of degradation and their resulting early loss of mechanical performance.\"You won't find any commercially approved, magnesium wire-based medical devices currently on the market because the high surface-to-volume ratio of magnesium wire results in its rapid degradation rate,\" explained IMDEA Materials researcher and Marie Curie Fellow Syed Wahaaj Ali Rizvi.\"However, by applying these new developments in surface modification, we are able to not only reduce that degradation rate, we were also able to improve their mechanical and biological performance.\"\"For instance, in our recent study, we show that without surface modification, the wires dissolved in an accelerated test environment facilitating simulated bodily fluid at 37 degrees within 24 hours. With our modifications, they remained intact for seven days. And even after four days, they were still demonstrating more than 100 MPa of strength, which is suitable for a number of medical applications.\"Rizvi was one of a number of researchers involved in the publications, alongside fellow IMDEA Materials scientists Prof. Javier Llorca, Prof. Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez, Dr. M\u00f3nica Echeverry Rend\u00f3n, Dr. Muzi Li and Guillermo Dominguez. The work also relied on the contributions of Meotec's Dr. Alexander Kopp, Leon Tillman, Tim Mayer and Kerstin van Gaalen, who was another Marie Curie Fellow within the program.Meotec's Dr. Kopp expressed confidence that the research would lead to a greater industrial interest in the further development and use of surface-modified magnesium wires.\"We are expecting that our new continuous PEO process ('C-PEO') will generate a considerable impact in industry,\" he said. \"Since PEO is one of the most important surface treatments to improve surface resistance and corrosion.\"\"As magnesium is prone to corrosion, the high surface fraction and the aspect ratio of such wires means that a proper surface treatment is of utmost importance. Now, such PEO treatment can potentially be scaled up to high productivity lines by going from a batch to a coil-to-coil process.\"The studies also show that the novel technique of surface modification resulted in a more uniform corrosion pattern of the wires as they dissolved. While altering the superficial structure to create a more porous structure also proved more conducive to the survivability of the cells required for regenerative tissue growth.The next step in the development of a new line of magnesium wire-based medical devices could require completion of additional clinical trials.

  "text": "CycPeptMPDB, a novel database created by Tokyo Tech researchers, focuses on the membrane permeability of cyclic peptides and could accelerate the development of drugs based on these promising compounds. This database was created by gathering published information on thousands of cyclic peptides and organizing it neatly in an online-accessible platform. Thanks to its search and visualization capabilities, CycPeptMPDB could pave the way to new computational and machine learning methods for screening and designing drugs with cyclic peptides.          One of the greatest challenges in modern drug design is to find compounds that satisfy somewhat contradictory requirements\u2014they need to be small enough to permeate human cell membranes, while being large enough to target various protein surfaces and protein\u2013protein interactions. This is a fine balance to achieve\u2014if the compounds are too large, they may not pass through the cell membrane, and their bioavailability would be affected; if they are too small, they would not retain high specificity to the target protein (or proteins).Scientists estimate that more than 80% of all known proteins associated with diseases cannot be targeted by conventional small-molecule drugs or antibody-based drugs. That is why, in recent years, cyclic peptides have become a very active research area. In principle, these compounds can achieve the fine balance required of modern drugs.A cyclic peptide is a type of organic molecule that consists of amino acids linked together in a circular or lariat shape. What makes them particularly attractive is that they can target intracellular protein\u2013protein interactions, which have been considered \"undruggable\" for decades. Moreover, cyclic peptides are inexpensive to synthesize compared to antibody-based drugs, prompting many pharmaceutical companies to conduct extensive research on these compounds.However, one of the biggest hurdles to overcome in cyclic peptide research is that their membrane permeability\u2014which controls their bioavailability and efficiency as drugs\u2014is low in general, and the mechanisms behind this are not completely understood. Thus, during drug design, it is difficult for researchers to select candidate peptides that are likely to make it through the cell membrane. On top of this, there are currently no openly accessible databases documenting the membrane permeabilities of known cyclic peptides.      A team of researchers from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan, including Professor Yutaka Akiyama, decided to take a step towards making cyclic peptide research easier for everyone. As explained in their latest paper published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, the team created an online database called CycPeptMPDB that contains information on thousands of cyclic peptides, including their membrane permeability.To build the database, they gathered data from previously published papers and pharmaceutical patents. After inspecting more than 40 publications, they collected information on 7,334 cyclic peptides with widely different chemical structures. They loaded the membrane permeability values and important physical parameters such as lipophilicity of these peptides onto the database.Moreover, to make further analysis and visualization of the molecules possible, the researchers calculated the most likely 3D conformation of each peptide and added it to the database. They also encoded the chemical structure of each cyclic peptide in a novel descriptive notation (called HELM), making it possible to unambiguously refer to any cyclic peptide in the database using a short string of text.The team has high hopes for their platform and believe that it could become a game changer in the design and development of cyclic peptide drugs. \"CycPeptMPDB provides several functions, including data storage, statistics and visualization, searching and analysis, and downloading. We expect it will become a valuable tool to support membrane permeability research on cyclic peptides,\" says Prof. Akiyama.It is also worth noting, that databases such as CycPeptMPDB are essential for training machine learning models, which can accelerate the selection of drug candidates and reveal hidden patterns in the data.\"We will continue to collect membrane permeability data of cyclic peptides and record them in CycPeptMPDB. Additionally, future improvements to the database's online analysis platform will include an improved user-friendly interface and more integrative functions,\" says Prof. Akiyama.

  "question_squad": " What is the key driver of climate change?",
  "answer_squad": " carbon dioxide",
  "text": "Being the most abundant and persistent greenhouse gas emitted, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the key driver of climate change. To address the pressing problems associated with climate change and fossil fuel depletion, scientists are looking for viable solutions that can minimize the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere.          One attractive solution to this problem is to convert atmospheric CO2 into more useful compounds. Towards this end, methanol\u2014a raw material, fuel additive, and energy carrier\u2014is widely being explored as a promising conversion option for CO2.While various catalysts are currently used for CO2 conversion reactions, most of them were designed and investigated for use in high-temperature and -pressure conditions. This is a serious limitation for multiple reasons.First, maintaining such conditions requires energy and expensive containment systems. Second, the CO2 hydrogenation reaction is exothermic, and thus proceeds more favorably at lower temperatures. Third, high temperatures can sometimes compromise the stability of catalysts, resulting in their reduced lifespan. Finally, the conversion efficiency of existing heterogenous catalysts is extremely low for catalyzing such conversion reactions.Against this backdrop, a team of researchers led by Professor Hideo Hosono from Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, set out to develop a better catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation. In their study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, they report the development of a novel intermetallic catalyst synthesized via a simple ammonolysis process by combining palladium (Pd) and molybdenum (Mo).To synthesize this catalyst, the researchers employed a simple approach based on ammonolysis of an oxide precursor. Put simply, ammonolysis can be used to combine metals by mixing precursors, such as oxides or nitrates, with ammonia gas at high temperatures. Ammonia reacts with the precursors to form intermediate complexes called metal amides, which then decompose to form the desired intermetallic compound.Using various analytical techniques, the team determined the crystal structure of the \"h-PdMo\" catalyst and probed its chemical and thermal stability. Notably, they found that h-PdMo was stable at temperatures up to 400 \u00b0C and did not decompose in air. \"This kind of robustness is very important when considering the practicality of a catalyst,\" remarks Prof. Hosono.Next, the researchers evaluated the performance of h-PdMo for CO2 hydrogenation under different conditions. At a temperature of 100 \u00b0C, the catalyst was capable of continuous methanol production without any significant sign of degradation, for over 100 hours. Moreover, at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) and under relatively low pressure, the performance of h-PdMo was remarkable.Explaining the findings further, Prof. Hosono says, \"At a pressure of 0.9 MPa, our catalyst achieved a conversion efficiency comparable to or even higher than that of state-of-the-art heterogeneous catalysts, that demonstrate similar turn over efficiency under higher-pressure conditions in the range of 4 to 5 MPa.\"In summary, the researchers developed a very active and stable catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation at room temperature that can be synthesized via a simple process. Prof. Hosono concludes by saying, \"Our discovery provides a frontier for catalyst development, not only for low-temperature methanol synthesis and CO2 conversion reactions, but also for other reactions catalyzed by Pd.\" More information:Hironobu Sugiyama et al, Room-Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol over Air-Stable hcp-PdMo Intermetallic Catalyst, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the new class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides?",
  "answer_squad": " daptides",
  "text": "Living organisms produce a myriad of natural products which can be used in modern medicine and therapeutics. Bacteria and other microbes have become the main source for natural products, including a growing family called ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, or RiPPs. The labs of Douglas Mitchell (MMG), John and Margaret Witt Professor of Chemistry, and Huimin Zhao (CABBI/BSD/GSE/MMG), Steven L. Miller Chair of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have been working in tandem to identify and analyze new RiPPs that could be good candidates for drug development and therapeutics.          \"Compared to other classes of natural products such as alkaloids, terpenes, or polyketides, RiPPs are still underexplored, partly because their biosynthetic gene clusters are quite small and were often overlooked in the past,\" said Zhao. \"So we decided to develop new technologies to discover novel RiPPs with biological activity.\"\"Now that we're in the genomics era, we're realizing just how widespread these groups of natural products are, especially in bacteria,\" said Shravan Dommaraju, a Ph.D. candidate in Mitchell's lab. \"We're basically in this exploration phase, where we know that they're out there, and the goal is to see how many we can find because we don't know what they all do yet.\"In a new paper by the Zhao and Mitchell labs, with co-first authors Dommaraju and Hengqian Ren, a postdoctoral researcher in Zhao's lab, the team reported the discovery of a unique, novel class of RiPPs, which they have named \"daptides.\" Unlike most peptides which have one positively charged and one negatively charged end, or \"terminus,\" daptides instead have two positively charged termini.\"A textbook would say that a peptide has an amino terminus and a carboxy terminus, but in our case, we found a ribosomal peptide that has two amino termini,\" said Ren. \"Because there's positive charge at both ends, this gives daptides some interesting bioactivities.\"The researchers explained that while this change in termini may seem small, the positive charge of both termini gives daptides the potential to interact with negatively charged objects, such as cell membranes. To test this, the team added the daptides to a dish with red blood cells. They found that the daptides showed hemolytic activity, meaning that they disrupted the membranes of the cells, causing them to rupture. Zhao explained that hemolytic activity is rarely found in the RiPPs the team works with, and that antimicrobial or antifungal activity is much more common.\"We were thinking about the structure and what is the evolutionary drive to cause a peptide to lose the negatively charged C terminus and replace it with a positively charged amino group,\" Dommaraju said. \"From an engineering perspective, if you wanted to make a peptide that can interact with a membrane, you would stick a bunch of positive charges on it. And that's actually what led us to testing this for hemolytic activity because we knew that it had this modification that should allow for that.\"      Finding new RiPPs is no easy task. First the researchers use bioinformatics to compare and try to identify gene clusters that could produce potential RiPPs. Then they clone the targeted cluster and place it into an organism to be expressed, after which they can check for any natural products produced. Even after obtaining the products, there is still the question of what the products do and how they are produced, which can be tested with bioassays, gene knockouts, and a variety of other tests. But Dommaraju says the labs each play to their expertise when collaborating to streamline the process.\"So on a project like this, the Mitchell lab does the bioinformatics and identifies cool gene clusters, and the Zhao lab gets the synthetic biology system up and going to express these peptides and make them,\" Dommaraju explained. \"So then we are able to tag team our experience and the overlapping stuff that we do to get the project to the finish line.\"The researchers say the next steps are to understand the enzyme functions of the daptides, and use bioinformatics analysis to see if there are other combinations of genes associated with daptide production. Directions for further studies in the future include exploring potential therapeutic uses for daptides, and the ecological role that daptide production has for the bacteria that make them. However, both Ren and Dommaraju agreed that their interests in future experiments with RiPPs extends beyond just daptides, as there are still more classes to discover.\"We're interested in using our bioinformatics tool to find as many different natural product classes as we possibly can,\" said Ren. \"There is such a large frontier right now of undiscovered RiPP classes, and it's exciting to be at the cutting edge, discovering new possibilities. There's always a chance that the next product you find might be a major therapeutic development!\"The paper is published in Nature Communications.

  "question_squad": " What is the term for the process where bacteria floats along and starts new colonies?",
  "answer_squad": " biofouling",
  "text": "Similar to how cells within human tissues communicate and function together as a whole, bacteria are also able to communicate with each other through chemical signals, a behavior known as quorum signaling (QS). These chemical signals spread through a biofilm that colonies of bacteria form after they reach a certain density, and are used to help the colonies scavenge food, as well as defend against threats, like antibiotics.          \"QS helps them to build infrastructure around them, like a city,\" described Dharmesh Parmar, a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Jonathan Sweedler (CABBI/BSD/MMG), James R. Eiszner Family Endowed Chair in the department of chemistry. \"Biofilms have channels, which allow passage of nutrients, and information in the form of chemical signals. They also allow crosstalk between colonies if there's a threat or the stress in the environment.\"Biofilm formation and the subsequent resistance to antibiotics can be especially dangerous for people with a weakened immunity or with diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), which leads to a stagnant mucus surface inside the lungs that bacteria can more easily attach to. To better understand what surface factors influence or potentially inhibit biofilm formation in the presence of antibiotics, researchers from the Sweedler lab at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, along with collaborators at the University of Notre Dame, measured rate of biofilm formation via QS in a bacteria commonly acquired in hospital infections, Pseudomonas aeruginosa.P. aeruginosa forms biofilms rapidly on a variety of surfaces, which expedites when colonies start communicating using QS, and makes treatment with antibiotics difficult. Additionally, P. aeruginosa can vary in the thickness of the biofilm it produces. The \"mucoid\" strain produces a thicker biofilm than the non-mucoid strain, and is often linked to infections in patients with CF, a genetic condition which increases mucus viscosity and accumulation in the lungs.In the study, both of these strains were grown on fabricated surfaces that varied in structure, with one being uniform or \"unpatterned,\" and the other being \"patterned\" with ridged blocks. Researchers then measured how quickly colonies were able to start communicating with QS while being grown either in the presence of antibiotics or not. QS was detected using mass spectrometry and Raman-imaging, which measured the presence of signaling molecules associated with the behavior.      The first thing researchers noticed was that antibiotics slowed growth of a biofilm and production of QS molecules across both strains and structure types. Next, the researchers found that surface type had a large effect on the non-mucoid strain, in that the patterned structure was associated with longer latencies before expression of QS molecules were at their peak. This was not the case for the thicker mucoid strain.\"While the impact of the antibiotic slowing biofilm growth didn't surprise us, the large and differential impact on surface structure was striking,\" said Sweedler.\"In the non-mucoid strain, surface patterning had a huge impact on the QS signal properties,\" Parmar added. \"In the case of mucoid, the surface structure had very minimal impact on its metabolic signatures.\"The researchers also explored how the distribution of QS signaling molecules differed across different parts of the biofilm when grown on a flat surface and exposed to antibiotics. Samples were taken from the \"static biofilm,\" where the biofilm attaches to the surface, the \"supernatant,\" or liquid medium of the culture, and the \"pellicle biofilm,\" that forms on top of the liquid medium and interacts with the air.Researchers found that the supernatant liquid and pellicle biofilms contained signaling molecules associated with a stress response, while the static biofilm did not contain these molecules. The researchers think this is because the liquid component of the biofilm is what allows bacteria to float along and start new colonies elsewhere, but in the process the bacteria are also exposed to threatening situations, such as presence of antibiotics.By comparing QS behavior during biofilm growth across these different treatments, researchers can better understand how and what kind of molecules this species of bacteria use, and gain new insights on bacterial growth.\"P. aeruginosa biofilm is quite challenging to eradicate using currently available antibiotics, and so our goal with this study was to understand what are the factors that govern the growth and stability of these biofilms, and how bacteria escapes these biofilm structures to colonize new locations,\" explained Parmar.\"The chemically information-rich approaches and analytical techniques we used allowed us to probe these complex molecular events related to biofilm formation across space and time,\" Sweedler explained.The team says the next step is to use these optimized analytical techniques to measure QS signals on lung slices from rats, instead of fabricated structures like those used in the current study. Because P. aeruginosa is often associated with infections in the lungs of CF patients, understanding how it forms biofilms in the lungs can help scientists engineer methods to slow or prevent bacteria growth in these patients.Parmar described one potential future application could be to engineer surfaces of medical devices to deter bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. These findings could also be used to help prevent biofouling, which is when bacteria spoils or degrades biological products and surfaces.The paper is published in ACS Infectious Diseases.

  "text": "A research team at POSTECH has successfully synthesized a new hybrid material that effectively captures carbon dioxide and other toxic gases through its porous organic-inorganic structure.          The sparsely-pillared organic-inorganic hybrid compound (SPOIC) was developed through a collaborative effort led by POSTECH professors Jisoon Ihm (Department of Physics), Kilwon Cho, Seok Hwan Park (Department of Chemical Engineering). SPOIC features a myriad of tiny pores that provide a wide surface area; organic and inorganic components that are non-toxic to humans; and a safe, simple, and eco-friendly production process.This material is designed to maximize the interlayer space in the aluminum hydroxide's layered structure by inserting organic molecules with a wide interval between the layers, creating a form that maximizes interlayer space. As a result, the molecules inserted into this space become stably adsorbed or trapped by binding to the inner surfaces of the layers.This material is highly effective in adsorbing, storing, or removing diverse harmful substances, including greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, pollutants like nitrogen oxides that cause particulate matter, and heavy metals and radioactive materials. It can also serve as a versatile platform material for attaching functional groups for specific applications.After developing their latest creation, lead investigator Jisoon Ihm entered the XPRIZE Carbon Removal, an international competition aimed at capturing and removing carbon dioxide. Professor Ihm's team obtained qualification certification to participate and showcase their innovation. The novel material has been featured on various mainstream media outlets in Korea as well.This material has already obtained patents in Korea, Japan, and the United States.Professor Ihm remarked, \"We anticipate this material to be widely used for capturing carbon dioxide and various harmful substances.\" Provided byPohang University of Science and TechnologyCitation:Porous material for selective trapping of carbon dioxide and toxic gases (2023, April 4)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-porous-material-carbon-dioxide-toxic.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Fossil fuel consumption contributes to significant greenhouse gas emissions and severe climate issues. It is imperative to explore sustainable alternatives to the current industrial production of chemicals and fuels. The efficient utilization of lignocellulosic biomass as a substitute for fossil resources is a promising approach to promote the sustainable development of modern society.          Although numerous valorization routes for lignocellulose have been explored, large-scale lignocellulose valorizations are still limited. In this regard, a group of researchers has summarized the catalytic reaction routes, reaction types, and key steps for the selective preparation of various important products from lignocellulose with four panoramic reaction network maps.They also point out the challenges and possible resolving strategies in the lignocellulose valorization processes. This could provide a panoramic view of the related field and facilitate the development of sustainable and efficient lignocellulose-based biorefineries. This review was published in Industrial Chemistry & Materials.\"The valorization of lignocellulose for the production of chemicals or fuels has been the subject of extensive research, which has been comprehensively reviewed by numerous scholars with expertise in the field,\" said corresponding author Ying Zhang, a professor at the University of Science and Technology of China.\"These reviews provide detailed insights into the catalytic performance and mechanisms involved, which can be of great assistance to researchers. However, the large-scale valorization of lignocellulose requires the collaborative efforts of scientists, engineers, economic evaluators, entrepreneurs, and policymakers. Therefore, a more concise and comprehensive panoramic perspective is necessary for individuals who are new to this field but are interested in it.\"\"This review can facilitate the identification of specific converting sections for the preparation of chemicals of interest from biomass, and promote large-scale production. As a result, we have conducted this work to provide a comprehensive and concise overview of the valorization of lignocellulose, which can serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals alike.\"Renewable lignocellulose is a highly versatile resource that can be utilized to produce an array of value-added chemicals. The reaction routes and resulting products are dependent on the raw materials used. \"Drawing on an extensive body of research, we have developed four panoramic reaction network maps that highlight critical steps involved in the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass,\" Zhang said.      The maps provide a detailed overview of the conversions from cellulose to a range of valuable C2 to C6 chemicals, as well as reactions that begin with or involve platform molecules such as 5-hydroxylfurfural (HMF) and furfural, which can be transformed into functional compounds and aviation fuels. The review also covers oxidative and reductive depolymerization of lignin, as well as selective hydrodeoxygenation steps that result in the production of various monomers.\"Through these four maps, we can have a comprehensive understanding of the reactions routes involved in the valorization of lignocellulose,\" Zhang said.But how do we integrate the reaction routes with practical applications? Currently, while a few commercial and semi-commercial products such as furfural, levulinic acid, vanillin, HMF, and FDCA have been successfully derived from lignocellulose or its main components, most research efforts are confined to laboratory settings.\"The concept of an integrated biorefinery can only succeed if the costs of chemicals produced from lignocellulosic biomass are comparable or lower than those from fossil fuels,\" Zhang said.\"Currently, given that much of the biomass valorization research is still in its early stages, the findings are insufficient to conduct techno-economic analysis. A set of metrics addressing resource efficiency (carbon footprint and waste production), catalyst performance (selectivity, activity, and consumption), and product recovery can serve as the initial guideline in evaluating what feedstock, chemistry, and technology deserve further exploitation, or in defining preliminary performance targets which may have the industrial potential.\"The rational design of catalysts is crucial for the valorization of lignocellulose. According to Ying Zhang, a series of challenges must be addressed to successfully synthesize robust and easily regenerated catalysts, accurately design multifunctional catalysts with high activity and selectivity, and gain a thorough understanding of the reaction mechanism. These are key to unlocking the full potential of lignocellulose as a valuable resource.\"The primary objective of this work is to provide readers with a clear understanding of the current research and applications of lignocellulose, while highlighting the challenges that must be overcome. We hope it is helpful to promote the development of innovative solutions that can contribute to the sustainable production of chemicals and fuels through extensive collaboration,\" Zhang said.

  "text": "Materials known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have a rigid, cage-like structure that lends itself to a variety of applications, from gas storage to drug delivery. By changing the building blocks that go into the materials, or the way they are arranged, researchers can design MOFs suited to different uses.          However, not all possible MOF structures are stable enough to be deployed for applications such as catalyzing reactions or storing gases. To help researchers figure out which MOF structures might work best for a given application, MIT researchers have developed a computational approach that allows them to predict which structures will be the most stable.Using their computational model, the researchers have identified about 10,000 possible MOF structures that they classify as \"ultrastable,\" making them good candidates for applications such as converting methane gas to methanol.\"When people come up with hypothetical MOF materials, they don't necessarily know beforehand how stable that material is,\" says Heather Kulik, an MIT associate professor of chemistry and chemical engineering, and the senior author of the study.\"We used data and our machine-learning models to come up with building blocks that were expected to have high stability, and when we recombined those in ways that were considerably more diverse, our dataset was enriched with materials with higher stability than any previous set of hypothetical materials people had come up with.\"MIT graduate student Aditya Nandy is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in the journal Matter. Other authors are MIT postdoc Shuwen Yue, graduate students Changhwan Oh and Gianmarco Terrones, Chenru Duan Ph.D. '22, and Yongchul G. Chung, an associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Pusan National University.Modeling MOFsScientists are interested in MOFs because they have a porous structure that makes them well-suited to applications involving gases, such as gas storage, separating similar gases from each other, or converting one gas to another. Recently, scientists have also begun to explore using them to deliver drugs or imaging agents within the body.The two main components of MOFs are secondary building units\u2014organic molecules that incorporate metal atoms such as zinc or copper\u2014and organic molecules called linkers, which connect the secondary building units. These parts can be combined together in many different ways, just like LEGO building blocks, Kulik says.\"Because there are so many different types of LEGO blocks and ways you can assemble them, it gives rise to a combinatorial explosion of different possible metal organic framework materials,\" she says. \"You can really control the overall structure of the metal organic framework by picking and choosing how you assemble different components.\"Currently, the most common way to design MOFs is through trial-and-error. More recently, researchers have begun to try computational approaches to designing these materials. Most such studies have been based on predictions of how well the material will work for a particular application, but they don't always take into account the stability of the resulting material.\"A really good MOF material for catalysis or for gas storage would have a very open structure, but once you have this open structure, it may be really hard to make sure that that material is also stable under long-term use,\" Kulik says.In a 2021 study, Kulik reported a new model that she created by mining a few thousand papers on MOFs to find data on the temperature at which a given MOF would break down and whether particular MOFs can withstand the conditions needed to remove solvents used to synthesize them. She trained the computer model to predict those two features\u2014known as thermal stability and activation stability\u2014based on the molecules' structure.In the new study, Kulik and her students used that model to identify about 500 MOFs with very high stability. Then, they broke those MOFs down into their most common building blocks\u2014120 secondary building units and 16 linkers.By recombining these building blocks using about 750 different types of architectures, including many that are not usually included in such models, the researchers generated about 50,000 new MOF structures.\"One of the things that was unique about our set was that we looked at a lot more diverse crystal symmetries than had ever been looked at before, but [we did so] using these building blocks that had only come from experimentally synthesized highly stable MOFs,\" Kulik says.      UltrastabilityThe researchers then used their computational models to predict how stable each of these 50,000 structures would be, and identified about 10,000 that they deemed ultrastable, both for thermal stability and activation stability.They also screened the structures for their \"deliverable capacity\"\u2014a measure of a material's ability to store and release gases. For this analysis, the researchers used methane gas, because capturing methane could be useful for removing it from the atmosphere or converting it to methanol. They found that the 10,000 ultrastable materials they identified had good deliverable capacities for methane and they were also mechanically stable, as measured by their predicted elastic modulus.\"Designing a MOF requires consideration of many types of stability, but our models enable a near-zero-cost prediction of thermal and activation stability,\" Nandy says. \"By also understanding the mechanical stability of these materials, we provide a new way to identify promising materials.\"The researchers also identified certain building blocks that tend to produce more stable materials. One of the secondary building units with the best stability was a molecule that contains gadolinium, a rare-earth metal. Another was a cobalt-containing porphyrin\u2014a large organic molecule made of four interconnected rings.Students in Kulik's lab are now working on synthesizing some of these MOF structures and testing them in the lab for their stability and potential catalytic ability and gas separation ability. The researchers have also made their database of ultrastable materials available for researchers interested in testing them for their own scientific applications. More information:Heather J.

  "text": "A team of chemists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Chemistry has developed a process for dramatically improving the efficiency of bacterial production of a commercial polypeptide. Their paper is published in the journal Science Advances.          Microbes have been used to produce natural products for several decades, but in many cases, yields are too low for mass production. So chemists have been looking for ways to improve yields using symbiotic characteristics between microbes. In this new effort, the research team took advantage of different characteristics of three types of bacteria to create an environment that would produce a commercially desirable polypeptide\u2014and then they added a conductive copolymer to improve efficiency even more.The work started with the bacteria Bacillus licheniformis, which lives in soil. It has a natural ability to make \u03b3-polyglutamic acid (\u03b3-PGA), a useful polypeptide. They then added cyanobacteria to fix carbon in the air and to use it via photosynthesis to produce a carbohydrate. Next, they added Rhodopseudomonas palustris\u2014bacteria that can convert nitrogen in the air into ammonium.The result was a mixture of bacteria that together could produce \u03b3-PGA much more efficiently than any known natural method alone, using only solar power, airborne carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Still, the researchers knew the process could be improved. They added a conductive copolymer that allowed the mix of bacteria to form a network of sorts, which made the process of producing \u03b3-PGA both more stable and more efficient.The process produced an increase in yield by approximately 104% over other natural methods. It also improved photosynthetic efficiency from 0.71 to 1.43%. The team also tweaked the system to make it produce bacitracin A and found it increased yields over other natural methods by approximately 77%. The research group notes that the process is also low-cost and easily scaled up to manufacturing standards. They conclude that their process also serves as a proof of concept, opening the door to the development of similar processes using different ingredients to make different end products.

  "text": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been gaining attention as promising carbon-neutral porous materials, thanks to their high performance in gas storage, separation, and conversion. The geometric building blocks of MOFs, metal clusters and organic linkers, allow chemists to predict and synthesize new structures like assembling LEGO. However, finding new metal building blocks is still a daunting challenge due to the complex nature of metal ions in synthesis.          A research team, led by Professor Wonyoung Choe at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), South Korea, was inspired by the molecular metal clusters previously synthesized before realized in porous materials. This implies one can predict future MOFs by looking closely at their metal building blocks.The research team compared zirconium metal clusters found in both MOFs and molecules. Zirconium-based MOFs are one of the representative metal-organic porous materials with remarkable stability and a broad range of applications. The researchers identified seven types of zirconium building blocks in MOFs and discovered additional fourteen types of potential metal building blocks.The research team provided a library of those various molecular clusters for future metal building blocks of MOFs, and suggested practical synthetic strategies. This research is expected to greatly accelerate the discovery of new MOFs by presenting metal cluster candidates whose structures were previously difficult to predict.\"Zirconium metal clusters feature outstanding molecular adsorptive and catalytic properties depending on their structures. Very excited to see what properties the new zirconium cluster will show,\" said Dr. Dongsik Nam, the first author of the study.\"This research can be extended to various metal clusters in MOFs beyond zirconium,\" noted Professor Wonyoung Choe. \"New metal building blocks will provide a big hint to accelerate the discovery of future carbon-neutral porous materials.\"The findings of this research have been published in Trends in Chemistry.

  "text": "A recent study in the Journal of Biological Chemistry revealed the key to a protein that commonly causes blindness. The biological process involves a protein that is essential for transporting toxic compounds out of the eye, similar to a garbage recycling service. The challenge is that, like food and the waste it generates, these compounds are essential for the eye to function properly\u2014until they build up and cause blindness.          The scientists behind the study research a protein transporter, called ABCA4, that lines the edges of specialized photoreceptor cells in the retina and is normally poised to remove toxic, fatty retinal byproducts called N-Ret-PE. Retinal is a derivative of vitamin A, which is found in foods such as leafy green vegetables.\"Retinal is critical for vision,\" said Robert Molday, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of British Columbia who oversaw the work. \"But, it's also potentially very toxic because it has a very reactive element. So, cells have to be able to balance between using retinal for sustained vision as well as managing its toxicity.\"Mutations in ABCA4 can cause N-Ret-PE buildup, which leads to vision loss in diseases such as Stargardt disease. Stargardt disease is the most common inherited form of macular degeneration and affects approximately 30,000 people nationwide. There is currently no therapy or cure for the disease.The researchers were interested in finding out how the ABCA4 transporter malfunctions to cause vision loss. They found that a portion of the protein that interacts with N-Ret-PE, known as the binding pocket, is inert in some patients with Stargardt disease. Therefore, the toxic compounds slip out of the ABCA4 transporter and cannot be removed from the retina.Next, by changing the makeup of ABCA4, the researchers showed they could mimic the effect of the Stargardt mutations.\"We were able to elucidate the mechanism of binding, which paves the way for treatments for Stargardt disease,\" Tongzhou Xu, a postdoctoral fellow at UBC and lead author of the study, said.The team is optimistic that one day there will be a targeted therapeutic for patients with Stargardt disease that may use gene therapy and specialized particles for delivery to the eye. Gene therapy approaches have already been successfully used to correct mutations in a similar transporter, which causes cystic fibrosis.\"We are now applying two types of technologies to alter ABCA4,\" Molday said. \"One which was developed to specifically correct the DNA with gene-editing approaches. We are coupling that with lipid nanoparticles, which have been used in the COVID-19 vaccine to encapsulate mRNA. So, by combining these two technologies, we envision being able to potentially correct the defects in individuals with Stargardt's disease that have specific point mutations.\" More information:Tongzhou Xu et al, Retinal-phospholipid Schiff-base conjugates and their interaction with ABCA4, the ABC transporter associated with Stargardt Disease, Journal of Biological Chemistry (2023).

  "text": "Due to their singular properties and the functionality attributed to their unique scaffolding, helical polymers are of particular interest to the scientific community. There are specific points along the polymer chain of these compounds where the sense of the helix changes, which are difficult to identify in solution.          Employing photochemical methods, Center for Research in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Materials (CiQUS) researchers have now determined not only the presence of these helix reversals in polymer solution but also to estimated its folding degree. The results has been recently published in Nature Communications.Most of the functions performed by biological molecules such as proteins, peptides or DNA are determined by their three-dimensional conformation. In helical polymers, the structure-function relationship can affect their different applications: misfolding may cause their functionality disappear.Considering the polymer folding degree in solution can determine if the compound is well folded or presents a poorly folded structure that will badly affect to its potential applications. \"The most serious limitation when working with these macromolecules is the determination of their degree of folding. That is, to determine if the whole material is folded as a helix, or if some areas remain unfolded,\" explains Felix Freire, coauthor of the study and principal investigator at CiQUS.\"Furthermore, identifying the direction in which the helices rotate is key to determining the structure-function relationship of these materials.\"In this work, a team led by Prof. Freire and Prof. Qui\u00f1oa at CiQUS has developed a methodology for quantifying the folding degree of helical polymers. Through a photochemical electrocyclization process, the study conducted by Dr. Francisco Rey and Dr. Rafael Rodr\u00edguez consisted of unfolding the material to understand how it was folded.

  "text": "The health and environmental harms of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are well-known, but a new study calls into question their touted stain-fighting benefits. The study, published today in the AATCC Journal of Research, tested the performance of PFAS finishings on furniture fabrics and found that they had limited to no effectiveness, particularly under real-world conditions.          \"It was surprising that these harmful but supposedly indispensable chemicals had no practical benefit,\" said lead author Jonas LaPier, a Ph.D. candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. \"It makes you wonder what other uses of PFAS are also unnecessary and could be easily eliminated from products without noticeable change in performance.\"Using droplets of coffee and oil-based salad dressing, the researchers tested six PFAS-finished and three non-PFAS-finished fabrics used for indoor commercial furniture. For water-based coffee stains, none of the PFAS-finished fabrics performed better than the unfinished fabrics. The stains were minimal and easily removed from finished and unfinished fabrics alike. Only fabric type (e.g., polyester vs. cotton/nylon, patterned vs. unpatterned, light vs. dark, etc.) affected coffee stain performance.For oil-based stains, some PFAS-finished fabrics showed minimal improvements over unfinished fabrics; however, the performance differences between fabric types were much larger than from PFAS finishes. Further, any repellency provided by the finishes were quickly lost with abrasion, meaning that the benefits would be lost as soon as the furniture is worn with use.Exposures to PFAS from furniture occur during the manufacture, use, and disposal of finished fabrics, generating health risks for workers, consumers, and communities living near production sites as well as environmental harm.Some PFAS have been associated with a wide range of serious health harms, from cancer to obesity to more severe COVID-19 outcomes, and they contaminate the drinking water of many millions. Only a small fraction of the thousands of PFAS have been tested for toxicity, and all PFAS are either extremely persistent in the environment or break down into extremely persistent PFAS. Additionally, some newer PFAS first claimed to be safe have been determined later to be harmful to our health.\"PFAS are a public health nightmare and should only be used when essential,\" said Carol Kwiatkowski, co-author and scientist at the Green Science Policy Institute. \"In the case of these fabrics, they aren't delivering the desired performance of stain repellency, and like lipstick or car wax, they get reapplied, which introduces more PFAS into the environment and increases the risk of human exposure. There's simply no justification for continuing to use them in furniture.\"\"The results of the study align with what I've seen first-hand,\" said co-author Betsy Phillips, Director of Environmental Initiatives of the textile company Maharam. \"The presence of PFAS-based finishes doesn't prevent textiles from staining, especially after the finishes have become worn with use. The best way to prevent staining is to promptly clean up spills. When prompt cleaning isn't possible, choosing a thicker, darker, patterned fabric will help mask any stains that may permeate. Beyond staining, omitting PFAS is simply better for our health.\" More information:Jonas LaPier et al, Evaluating the Performance of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Finishes on Upholstery Fabrics, AATCC Journal of Research (2023).

  "text": "In the United States alone, drug-resistant bacteria and fungi infect almost 3 million people per year and kill about 35,000. Antibiotics are essential and effective, but in recent years overuse has led to some bacteria developing resistance to them. The infections are so difficult to treat, the World Health Organization deemed antibiotic resistance a top 10 global public health threat.          Now, Professor John E. Moses at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) has created a new weapon against these drug-resistant superbugs\u2014an antibiotic that can shape-shift by rearranging its atoms.Moses came up with the idea of shape-shifting antibiotics while observing tanks in military training exercises. With rotating turrets and nimble movements, the tanks could respond quickly to possible threats.A few years later, Moses learned of a molecule called bullvalene. Bullvalene is a fluxional molecule, meaning its atoms can swap positions. This gives it a changing shape with over a million possible configurations\u2014exactly the fluidity Moses was looking for.Several bacteria, including MRSA, VRSA, and VRE, have developed resistance to a potent antibiotic called vancomycin, used to treat everything from skin infections to meningitis. Moses thought he could improve the drug's bacteria-fighting performance by combining it with bullvalene.He turned to click chemistry, a Nobel Prize\u2013winning class of fast, high-yielding chemical reactions that \"click\" molecules together reliably. This makes the reactions more efficient for wide-scale use.\"Click chemistry is great,\" says Moses, who studied this revolutionary development under two-time Nobel laureate K. Barry Sharpless. \"It gives you certainty and the best chance you've got of making complex things.\"Using this technique, Moses and his colleagues created a new antibiotic with two vancomycin \"warheads\" and a fluctuating bullvalene center.Moses tested the new drug in collaboration with Dr. Tatiana Soares da-Costa (University of Adelaide). The researchers gave the drug to VRE-infected wax moth larvae, which are commonly used to test antibiotics. They found the shape-shifting antibiotic significantly more effective than vancomycin at clearing the deadly infection. Additionally, the bacteria didn't develop resistance to the new antibiotic.Researchers can use click chemistry with shape-shifting antibiotics to create a multitude of new drugs, Moses explains. Such weapons against infection may even be key to our species' survival and evolution.\"If we can invent molecules that mean the difference between life and death,\" he says, \"that'd be the greatest achievement ever.\" More information:Alessandra Ottonello et al, Shapeshifting bullvalene-linked vancomycin dimers as effective antibiotics against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

  "text": "99.5% of combustible ice is methane, making it an important reserve energy source. It is inferred that the reserves of combustible ice in the South China Sea amount to the equivalent of at least 80 billion tons of oil.          Current mining methods will lead to the gasification of the combustible ice during the decompression process, which poses a great challenge for the storage and transportation of methane gas. If the methane can be converted into liquid products offshore, it will provide a new prospect for the utilization of combustible ice.In light of that, a team led by Prof. Xiong Yujie and Prof. Long Ran from the University of Science and Technology (USTC) developed an efficient photocatalytic methane halogenation technology using only light, methane and seawater, the products of which can further transform into methanol and  pharmaceutical intermediates. Their work was published in Nature Communications.As a type of versatile platform molecule, methyl halides are widely used in the production of high value-added chemicals and fuels such as methanol, acetic acid and propylene. However, the current synthesis of methyl halides usually involves corrosive feedstocks such as chlorine and hydrogen bromide and harsh reaction conditions, which not only requires complex processes and huge energy consumption, but also poses potential threat to the environment.The research team designed a copper-doped titania catalysis and used widely available alkali halides as halogenation agent to achieve efficient synthesis of methyl halides under light with production rate reaching 1 mmol h-1m-2. This method takes advantage of the offshore light and seawater conditions to efficiently convert methane into chloromethane, verifying the practicability of photocatalytic methane chlorination technology in the utilization of combustible ice.Based on this technology, the team designed a tandem reaction device to synthesize methanol and pharmaceutical intermediates with methane. This work blazes a trail for the exploitation of combustible ice and the conversion from methane to high value-added chemical products.

  "text": "In certain molecules, the so-called photoacids, a proton can be released locally by excitation with light. There is a sudden change in the pH value in the solution\u2014a kind of fast switch that is important for many chemical and biological processes. Until now, however, it was still unclear what happens at the moment of proton release. This is exactly what researchers in the Cluster of Excellence Ruhr Explores Solvation RESOLV at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, have now been able to observe in an experiment using new technology.          They observed a beating between solute and solvent initiating a tiny quake, lasting only three to five picoseconds, before the proton starts to detach. They report on this in the journal Chemical Sciences.So far, the focus has been on dye or baseOne of the most studied so-called photoacids is pyranine, the fluorescent dye used, for instance, in yellow highlighters. \"Despite a wealth of experimental studies, the process that is at the very beginning of proton detachment still remained the subject of controversial debate,\" reports Professor Martina Havenith, spokesperson for RESOLV. However, the entire detachment process also happens on a time scale of only 90 picoseconds. A picosecond corresponds to a millionth of a millionth of a second.While previous studies focused mainly on the change of the dye after light excitation, the team was able to observe the change of the solvent, in this case water, during this process for the first time. This was achieved with the help of a newly developed technique, \"Optical Pump THz Probe Spectroscopy.\"Ultra-fast energy transmission\"We were able to follow how there is an oscillation at the beginning, which then subsides subsequently,\" describes Martina Havenith. \"It is exciting to see that the solvent response that promotes excited-state proton transfer could be caught in the act.\" The initial ultrafast transfer of energy within less than a picosecond causes a restructuring of the water molecules in the immediate vicinity and opens the way for the subsequent proton migration.The detection was made possible by the new laser laboratories in the ZEMOS research building. There, all external interference signals, such as those caused by electromagnetic radiation, temperature and humidity fluctuations, are minimized. Only then is it possible to detect even the tiniest tremors in a water jet with the dye.

  "question_squad": " What is the most important factor in determining the luminescence properties of RTP materials?",
  "answer_squad": " temperature",
  "text": "Organic materials with room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission have attracted extensive attention due to extraordinary properties including long lifetime, large Stokes shift, stimuli-responsiveness, and so on, and show bright prospects in broad fields. However, the energy of the excited state of organic phosphors is easily consumed through thermal radiation and collision deactivation.          Therefore, numerous design strategies such as creating a rigid environment through crystallization and supramolecular assembly are employed to improve the luminescent characteristics of RTP materials by restricting nonradiative transition, enhancing intersystem crossing, and so forth.A team of scientists summarizes the recent progress of organic RTP materials from the perspective of practical applications including luminescence and display, environmental detection, and bioimaging. Based on their works, the requirements of organic RTP materials for different applications are summarized, which may bring enlightenment to the future application research of RTP materials. This review was published in the journal Industrial Chemistry & Materials.Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have shown excellent performance on display screens recently, while only 25% of singlet excitons in fluorescent materials can be utilized to emit light. Therefore, the harvesting of singlet excitons and triplex excitons to achieve 100% theoretical internal quantum efficiency makes phosphorescent materials attractive.\"Relevant scientific researchers have designed many organic light-emitting diodes based on RTP with high external quantum efficiency by using different strategies, which far exceeds the 5% theoretical limit for typical fluorescent materials,\" said Ma, a professor at East China University of Science and Technology, China.Due to UV irradiation and the different lifetime of RTP emission, anti-counterfeiting or data encryption based on RTP materials has become a common and popular application. In addition to simple anti-counterfeiting and data encryption based on the on-off of UV light, the different lifetimes of RTP materials provide a feasible way to realize multiple anti-counterfeiting or data encryption by using time resolution techniques.Besides, the chemical-responsive RTP is also a potential means to realize multiple anti-counterfeiting. In addition to the applications above, RTP materials have also been studied for two rare but meaningful applications, printing, and visualization of latent fingerprints, due to their unique luminous properties.      \"As we all know, many factors affect the luminescence properties of RTP materials, such as oxygen, temperature, and so on,\" Ma said. \"So chemical sensors based on RTP are also an indispensable research direction, which can produce practical applications in environmental detection.\"The spin triplet property of ground state oxygen makes it easy for O2 to quench the triplet excitons of RTP materials, which makes RTP materials ideal candidates for O2 detection. Generally, the decreasing phosphorescent intensity and lifetime can both be utilized to realize quantitative detection of oxygen.Temperature is also a significant external environmental factor to affect RTP emission because the high temperature will enhance nonradiative transition, and thus the corresponding RTP materials are developed for temperature sensing. In addition, the quenching effect of small organic molecules on RTP emission makes chemical sensors based on RTP materials possible.Optical imaging plays an important role in biomedical and clinical research. Compared with fluorescence, RTP has a longer lifetime at a longer wavelength which is beneficial to eliminate fluorescence background interference and scattered light and gain a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SBR). Although RTP materials have many advantages in bioimaging, non-radiative decay and quenchers in aqueous solutions seriously hinder their practical application.Researchers innovatively proposed a supramolecular self-assembly strategy and top-down nanoparticle formulation to achieve stable phosphorescence at room temperature in an aqueous solution. Therefore, the researchers not only successfully constructed near-infrared phosphorescent materials with high resolution and deep penetration, but also developed RTP materials with long-wavelength excitation and phosphorescent emission simultaneously, effectively avoiding the damage of ultraviolet light to organisms.These works show huge potential application value in biological imaging.Although organic room temperature phosphorescent materials constructed by different strategies are widely used in various fields due to different luminescence properties, there is still huge research space to fabricate more excellent applied RTP materials. Therefore, the team also discusses how to overcome the challenges and the prospect of phosphorescent materials.To obtain efficient organic light-emitting diodes, phosphorescent materials need to meet the characteristics of high quantum yield and short lifetime, while RTP materials for anti-counterfeiting and encryption often require rich luminous colors and perform differently with UV excitation. And the application in biological imaging demands RTP materials to have longer wavelengths and lifetime to eliminate fluorescence background interference and gain a higher signal-to-noise ratio.Moreover, the application scope should be broadened due to the extraordinary optical properties of RTP materials. Further exploration of RTP materials will not only contribute to a deeper understanding of photoluminescence but promote the practical application of photoelectric functional materials in our life.

  "text": "Anticancer drugs are pivotal to cancer treatment, but their toxicity may not always be limited to cancer cells, resulting in harmful side-effects. To develop anticancer therapies that have fewer adverse effects on patients, scientists are now focusing on molecules that are less toxic to cells.          One such group of drugs is the \"kinesin inhibitors.\" These inhibitors prevent cancer progression by explicitly targeting kinesin motor proteins, which are required for the division of cancer cells. Centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E), a member of the kinesin motor protein, is a promising target for inhibitor therapy, as it is essential for tumor cell replication. However, determining the structure of CENP-E is crucial to identify inhibitor molecules that can bind to CENP-E and arrest the function.Interestingly, the binding of the energy molecule\u2014adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\u2014to the motor domain of CENP-E changes its structure or configuration. This also occurs when CENP-E binds to an inhibitor. So far, very few CENP-E inhibitors have been reported and none have been approved for clinical use. It is, therefore, important to acquire structural information on the CENP-E motor domain.To this end, a research team from Tokyo University of Science (TUS) in Japan used X-ray crystallography to elucidate the crystal structure of the complex formed by the CENP-E motor domain and a kinesin inhibitor.The study, which was led by Professor Hideshi Yokoyama from TUS, along with co-authors Ms. Asuka Shibuya from TUS, and Assistant Professor Naohisa Ogo, Associate Professor Jun-ichi Sawada, and Professor Akira Asai from the University of Shizuoka, was published in FEBS Letters.\"CENP-E selectively acts on dividing cells, making it a potential new target for anticancer drugs with fewer side-effects,\" says Dr. Yokoyama while discussing the motivation underlying this study.First, the team expressed the CENP-E motor domain in bacterial cells, following which they purified and mixed it with adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP)\u2014a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue. The mix was crystallized to obtain exhaustive X-ray data. Using this data, the team obtained the structure of CENP-E motor domain-AMPPNP complex.Next, they compared the structure with that of CENP-E-bound adenosine diphosphate (CENP-E-MgADP) as well as with other previously known kinesin motor protein-AMPPNP complexes. From these comparisons, the team speculated that the helix alpha 4 in the motor domain was likely to be responsible for the loose binding of CENP-E to microtubules, i.e., cell structures that are crucial to cell division.\"Compared to the \u03b14 helices of other kinesins, the \u03b14 of CENP-E binds slowly and with lesser strength to microtubules as compared to other kinesins, throughout the ATP hydrolysis cycle,\" adds Dr. Yokoyama.The discovery of the crystal structure of the complex is expected to facilitate additional structure-activity relationship studies, which will bring scientists a step closer to developing anticancer drugs targeting CENP-E. The research team is optimistic about the future applications of their research and are confident that it will be possible to design drugs based on the methods employed in this study.\"The ultimate goal is to use the preparation and crystallization methods described in our study for future drug design studies that aim at developing anticancer drugs with fewer side-effects,\" concludes a hopeful Dr. Yokoyama.

  "text": "2D materials get their strength from their atom-thin, sheet like structure. However, stacking multiple layers of a 2D material will sap it of the qualities that make it so useful.          Rice University materials scientist Jun Lou and collaborators at the University of Maryland showed that fine-tuning interlayer interactions in a class of 2D polymers known as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can determine the materials' loss or retention of desirable mechanical properties in multilayer or bulk form. In the process, the researchers engineered a lightweight material with high stiffness and strength that preserves its 2D properties even as a multilayer stack, according to a study published in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The finding is a first step toward enabling the use of 2D polymers in large-scale multifunctional applications where mechanical properties are important and could open the door to new high-performance filtration systems, carbon capture and energy storage technologies.\"This to us is a very exciting starting point,\" Lou said. \"A really nice thing about COFs and other 2D polymers is that you have a lot of chemistry knobs you can tune. This means you can rationally engineer the interlayer interactions. Essentially, you can make very strong modular systems using interlayer interaction design.\"Researchers looked at how two COFs with very similar structures behave when multiple layers were stacked together and found that a small difference in their structure led to completely different patterns of interlayer interaction.\"In order to successfully design COFs with desirable interlayer interactions you need scientific insight into the material structures of COFs,\" said Teng Li, a professor of mechanical engineering at Maryland. \"To this end, we rely on first-principles simulations of the COF materials at the molecular scale to offer crucial design guidelines.\"Qiyi Fang, a Rice alum and co-lead author on the study, said the Rice lab designed two types of COFs based on the scientific insight from the simulations developed by colleagues at Maryland.\"One of the COFs, like most 2D materials, does not have a very strong interlayer interaction, and the strength and elasticity of the material decreases with the number of layers added,\" Fang said. \"The other COF, however, exhibits strong interlayer interaction and retains its good mechanical properties even with the addition of multiple layers.\"      Maryland researcher and co-lead author Zhenqian Pang said the simulations helped pinpoint why the two COFs behaved differently.\"We found that the strong interlayer interaction in the latter COF results from the significantly enhanced hydrogen bonding among its special functional groups,\" Pang said.The fact that strong interactions between the 2D-material layers correlate with the persistence of desirable mechanical properties in the material's multilayer or bulk form gives researchers a clue about what it takes to make a bulk-layered material that retains the mechanical properties of its 2D counterpart.\"We believe this strong interlayer interaction is primarily due to the chemistry of the hydrogen bond,\" Lou said. \"Hydrogen bonds are universal and occur in many systems. In our study, we show that those hydrogen bonds between layers are not only quite strong, but also dynamic in the sense that if they break under stress, they reform as the layers slide over one another.\"Facilitating stronger bonds between 2D-material layers can weaken the bonds connecting the atoms within a layer.\"Interlayer interaction-tuning is possible in other 2D materials, but what generally happens is you're going to sacrifice the strong in-plane bonding environment of those 2D materials in order to have those functional groups attached,\" Lou said. \"So it's actually a trade-off. With 2D polymers, you don't necessarily have to have that trade-off. That's one of the very important motivations for taking this direction in our research.\"A 2D polymer is made up of identical atom groupings with linking elements\u2014the functional groups\u2014along each of its edges.\"The 2D polymer is a sort of designer system, in the sense that it's very tunable,\" Lou said.In previous research on 2D materials, Lou and collaborators had shown hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was 10 times more resistant to fracture than graphene.\"Like in graphene or h-BN, you still have this hexagonal lattice structure\u2014six atoms in a hexagon pattern that you repeat indefinitely,\" Lou said. \"But for the 2D polymer, you also have a linker or nodal unit, which makes that hexagon larger.\"A larger repeat element means the material is less dense.\"This COF is nearly 10 times less dense than graphene or h-BN,\" Fang said. \"As a result, the specific strength and specific stiffness of the COF are among the highest reported.\"\"This is significant because if we can show that this 2D material is as fracture-resistant as h-BN, it is also significantly lighter,\" Lou added. \"When you want greater strength without increasing the weight of your structure, this can be useful.\"This finding relates to some of the more application-driven ideas,\" he said. \"COFs could make excellent filtration membranes, for instance. Now we have a way to design very strong, very fracture-resistant, multilayer 2D polymers that could be very good candidates for membrane filtration applications.\"Lou said another potential application is for upgrading energy storage.\"We've already explored COF functionality for optimizing lithium-ion battery performance, and this shows we're on the right track,\" he said. \"For all these applications, 2D polymers' mechanical properties\u2014especially in terms of fracture resistance\u2014are very important.\"According to Li, the study's key insight is that \"tuning secondary intermolecular bonding is an effective materials-design strategy that could enable the development of an array of new materials with enhanced properties.\"\"This is distinct from the conventional materials design methods that rely largely on primary bonding,\" he said. \"There are fertile opportunities to design materials with this new strategy.\" More information:Fang, Qiyi et al, Superior mechanical properties of multilayer covalent-organic frameworks enabled by rationally tuning molecular interlayer interactions, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

  "text": "Research conducted at University of Limerick in Ireland has shown that crystal engineering can improve access to a drug used in the treatment of a tropical disease affecting millions worldwide.          The study investigated the potential benefits of an underexplored crystal engineering strategy to improve the properties of crystalline drugs, which in turn would improve drug absorption in the human system.The strategy was tested on a drug used for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease that affects over 250 million people worldwide.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identify schistosomiasis as second only to malaria as the most devastating parasitic disease.The research was led by Dr. Matteo Lusi, a Lecturer in Crystallography at University of Limerick, who is a researcher in the Bernal Institute in the Faculty of Science and Engineering, along with colleagues in UL, Italy, and Switzerland.The findings, which could have a significant impact in making medicine more soluble and palatable for children, have just been published in the Molecular Pharmaceutics journal.Praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug of choice for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease that affects 250 million people worldwide.Due to its low solubility and high permeability, a high dose is required\u2014particularly in children\u2014and the large volume makes it difficult to swallow, which decreases patience compliance and causes many cases to be untreated.While smaller dose forms are currently in development, they are considerably more expensive\u2014meaning that cheaper strategies to dose reduction using a more soluble form with increased absorption would be desirable.\"This work demonstrates that a solid solution could increase the solubility of the drug by up to eight times and its absorption in vivo\u2014or in the body\u2014which is key to greater efficacy and reduced side effects for the patients,\" explained Dr. Lusi.The results were obtained through a simple crystal modification with relatively low development and manufacturing costs, Dr. Lusi explained.\"As a proof of principle, we have focused on an essential drug for the treatment of a parasite that is common in tropical and undeveloped countries, many which cannot afford expensive medicines.\"Our approach is also a more general one that can be applied to any crystalline drug forms. This is also critical to achieving UN Sustainable Development grand challenges in good health and well-being,\" Dr. Lusi added.Dr. Lusi, a lecturer in UL's Department of Chemical Sciences and author of over 70 publications who is also the former director of the International School of Crystallography Erice, Italy, has said the goal of his research in this area \"is to understand how molecules and ions interact in the solid state or crystals and how molecular and ionic interactions translate into tangible chemical and physical properties.\"\"Ideally such knowledge can help create new crystalline materials with predetermined properties and functions.\"Dr. Lusi's research has investigated a little-known ability of molecules, which behave in a crystal as they do in a liquid form, in that they move, react together, and mix freely to create solutions.\"Crystalline materials are present in most drugs, and agrichemicals. In this sense there is already a considerable interest from pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and agrichemical companies to produce better products that are more stable, bioavailable, easier to produce and administer,\" the UL researcher explained.\"Such products will also have lower side effects and environmental footprint,\" Dr. Lusi added.

  "answer_squad": " intestinal microbiome",
  "text": "The intestinal microbiome, i.e., the community of bacteria and other microorganisms that live in the human gut, has been shown to affect the metabolism and the immune system. We still do not fully understand how the symbiosis between a healthy microbiome and the host is regulated and how bacterial overgrowth with pathogenic germs can be prevented.          A research team led by Professor Christoph Becker-Pauly from the Institute of Biochemistry at Kiel University (CAU) in collaboration with other working groups has now discovered an important mechanism influencing the intestinal microbiome in mouse models. The results were recently published in the journal Science Advances.\"For the first time, we were able to show that a complex of the enzymes meprin \u03b1 and meprin \u03b2 located on intestinal cells influences the microbiome composition by processing the substrate galectin-3,\" explained first author Cynthia B\u00fclck, Ph.D. student at the CAU's Institute of Biochemistry.\"The activity of this enzyme complex is in turn directly influenced by the microbiome,\" added Professor Christoph Becker-Pauly, member of the Cluster of Excellence \"Precision Medicine in Chronic Inflammation\" (PMI) and head of the Unit for Degradomics of the Protease Web. \"This means that the microbiome influences host proteins, which in turn influence the microbiome.\"The researchers studied this interplay of regulation of the enzyme complex in mouse models with different bacterial colonizations.Enzymatic cleavage influences binding to bacteriaThe research focused on the protein-cleaving enzymes meprin \u03b1 and meprin \u03b2, which are strongly expressed in healthy intestine and are significantly downregulated in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). \"On the one hand, we wanted to elucidate the function of meprins in the small and large intestine, and on the other hand, we wanted to understand how the composition of bacteria in the intestine is fundamentally regulated,\" said B\u00fclck.Meprin proteases are found throughout the entire intestine, but they are not typical digestive enzymes. \"In previous studies, we were already able to show that these enzymes are responsible for constant detachment and renewing of the mucus layer that protects the small intestinal epithelium,\" said Becker-Pauly.In order to clarify the further functions of meprins, which exist as the meprin \u03b1/\u03b2 complex in the large intestine, the researchers first employed a mass spectrometry-based method to search for substrates that are processed by this enzyme complex. \"We identified galectin-3 as an important substrate in the large intestine,\" stated Becker-Pauly.Galectin-3 is permanently produced in the intestinal villi. It is found both within the cells but also outside the cell in the mucus layer and can interact with bacteria, for example by agglutination. Proteolytic cleavage of galectin-3 by meprin \u03b1/\u03b2 resulted in altered bacterial binding properties. At the same time, depending on the bacterial composition, enzymatic processing of galectin-3 changes. \"This means that depending on how many and which bacteria are present, it also has an influence on how much galectin-3 is enzymatically processed,\" explained B\u00fclck. \"The host responds to the microbiome via the cleavage of galectin-3, which is then modulated differently.\"The work also showed that the enzymatic cleavage of galectin-3 leads to strong agglutination (clumping) and elimination of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a germ that is responsible for about 10% of all hospital infections in Germany.      Key role in microbiome homeostasis\"Understanding the physiological role of this enzyme complex in the intestine could provide new insights into the development of diseases as well as new ways to prevent and treat intestinal diseases,\" emphasized Becker-Pauly. In chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, not only the enzyme complex is reduced, but also the substrate galectin-3 is also downregulated. \"This may lead to an imbalance of the the intestinal microbiome so that pathogens can spread more easily,\" suspects the Kiel biochemist. This constellation is certainly not decisive for the development of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, as many factors play a role in this regard, but it should be considered.Further research will now focus on elucidating the mechanisms in more detail that lead to the agglutination of certain types of bacteria. In addition, further immunomodulatory substrates of the meprin \u03b1/\u03b2 complex have been identified and their function will now be analyzed.

  "text": "In aviation technology, environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) are designed to protect the turbine components made of SiCf/SiC ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) from environmental degradations in the combustion environment. Multicomponent/high-entropy rare-earth disilicates ((nRExi)2SI2O7) are promising in EBCs applications.          However, the design of (nRExi)2Si2O7 materials remains a crucial challenge, due to the versatile combinations of multiple RE elements, as well as the complex polymorphic phase competitions during materials fabrication.In a study recently published in Nature Communications, researchers from the Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, have uncovered the mechanisms of phase formation capability for multicomponent/high-entropy rare-earth disilicate materials and proposed a compositional design strategy.The researchers synthesized 21 multicomponent (REI0.25REII0.25REIII0.25REIV0.25)Si2O7 (RE = Y, La, Ce, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu). They found that the phase formation and stabilization of these materials was dependent on the average RE3+ radius as well as the deviations (\u03c3r) of different RE3+ combinations.Based on high-throughput density-functional-theory simulations, the researchers constructed ensembles containing several hundreds of representative configurations for model compositions, and calculated the configurational entropy mixing.They proposed an entropy descriptor, which captures whether the configurational randomness brought by multiple RE3+ cations can be sufficiently accommodated in the crystal lattice, and thus can be used to predict the phase formation capability of (nRExi)2SI2O7 materials.Based on these findings, the researchers proposed a strategy to design (nRExi)2SI2O7 materials with controlled phase formation capability and high-temperature stability, which leads to efficient design and synthesis of many new (nRExi)2SI2O7 (n = 2, 5, 6; equal and non-equal molar fraction of RE) materials.

  "answer_squad": " Tim Peterson",
  "text": "With the release of platforms like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, diffusion generative models have achieved mainstream popularity, owing to their ability to generate a series of absurd, breathtaking, and often meme-worthy images from text prompts like \"teddy bears working on new AI research on the moon in the 1980s.\"          But a team of researchers at MIT's Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health (Jameel Clinic) thinks there could be more to diffusion generative models than just creating surreal images\u2014they could accelerate the development of new drugs and reduce the likelihood of adverse side effects.A paper introducing this new molecular docking model, called DiffDock, will be presented at the 11th International Conference on Learning Representations. The model's unique approach to computational drug design is a paradigm shift from current state-of-the-art tools that most pharmaceutical companies use, presenting a major opportunity for an overhaul of the traditional drug development pipeline.Drugs typically function by interacting with the proteins that make up our bodies, or proteins of bacteria and viruses. Molecular docking was developed to gain insight into these interactions by predicting the atomic 3D coordinates with which a ligand (i.e., drug molecule) and protein could bind together.While molecular docking has led to the successful identification of drugs that now treat HIV and cancer, with each drug averaging a decade of development time and 90 percent of drug candidates failing costly clinical trials (most studies estimate average drug development costs to be around $1 billion to over $2 billion per drug), it's no wonder that researchers are looking for faster, more efficient ways to sift through potential drug molecules.Currently, most molecular docking tools used for in-silico drug design take a \"sampling and scoring\" approach, searching for a ligand \"pose\" that best fits the protein pocket. This time-consuming process evaluates a large number of different poses, then scores them based on how well the ligand binds to the protein.In previous deep-learning solutions, molecular docking is treated as a regression problem. In other words, \"it assumes that you have a single target that you're trying to optimize for and there's a single right answer,\" says Gabriele Corso, co-author and second-year MIT Ph.D. student in electrical engineering and computer science who is an affiliate of the MIT Computer Sciences and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).      \"With generative modeling, you assume that there is a distribution of possible answers\u2014this is critical in the presence of uncertainty.\"\"Instead of a single prediction as previously, you now allow multiple poses to be predicted, and each one with a different probability,\" adds Hannes St\u00e4rk, co-author and first-year MIT Ph.D. student in electrical engineering and computer science who is an affiliate of the MIT Computer Sciences and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). As a result, the model doesn't need to compromise in attempting to arrive at a single conclusion, which can be a recipe for failure.To understand how diffusion generative models work, it is helpful to explain them based on image-generating diffusion models. Here, diffusion models gradually add random noise to a 2D image through a series of steps, destroying the data in the image until it becomes nothing but grainy static. A neural network is then trained to recover the original image by reversing this noising process. The model can then generate new data by starting from a random configuration and iteratively removing the noise.In the case of DiffDock, after being trained on a variety of ligand and protein poses, the model is able to successfully identify multiple binding sites on proteins that it has never encountered before. Instead of generating new image data, it generates new 3D coordinates that help the ligand find potential angles that would allow it to fit into the protein pocket.This \"blind docking\" approach creates new opportunities to take advantage of AlphaFold 2 (2020), DeepMind's famous protein folding AI model. Since AlphaFold 1's initial release in 2018, there has been a great deal of excitement in the research community over the potential of AlphaFold's computationally folded protein structures to help identify new drug mechanisms of action.But state-of-the-art molecular docking tools have yet to demonstrate that their performance in binding ligands to computationally predicted structures is any better than random chance.Not only is DiffDock significantly more accurate than previous approaches to traditional docking benchmarks, thanks to its ability to reason at a higher scale and implicitly model some of the protein flexibility, DiffDock maintains high performance, even as other docking models begin to fail.In the more realistic scenario involving the use of computationally generated unbound protein structures, DiffDock places 22 percent of its predictions within 2 angstroms (widely considered to be the threshold for an accurate pose, 1\u00c5 corresponds to one over 10 billion meters), more than double other docking models barely hovering over 10 percent for some and dropping as low as 1.7 percent.These improvements create a new landscape of opportunities for biological research and drug discovery. For instance, many drugs are found via a process known as phenotypic screening, in which researchers observe the effects of a given drug on a disease without knowing which proteins the drug is acting upon.Discovering the mechanism of action of the drug is then critical to understanding how the drug can be improved and its potential side effects. This process, known as \"reverse screening,\" can be extremely challenging and costly, but a combination of protein folding techniques and DiffDock may allow performing a large part of the process in silico, allowing potential \"off-target\" side effects to be identified early on before clinical trials take place.\"DiffDock makes drug target identification much more possible. Before, one had to do laborious and costly experiments (months to years) with each protein to define the drug docking. But now, one can screen many proteins and do the triaging virtually in a day,\" Tim Peterson, an assistant professor at the University of Washington St. Louis School of Medicine, says. Peterson used DiffDock to characterize the mechanism of action of a novel drug candidate treating aging-related diseases in a recent paper.\"There is a very 'fate loves irony' aspect that Eroom's law\u2014that drug discovery takes longer and costs more money each year\u2014is being solved by its namesake Moore's law\u2014that computers get faster and cheaper each year\u2014using tools such as DiffDock.\"The findings are published on the arXiv preprint server.

  "text": "Manganese oxides are natural reactive minerals and widely spread in aquatic and terrestrial environments, affecting the fate of metals (such as As3+ and Cd2+) and organic pollutants (such as phenols and diclofenac) through adsorption and oxidation in sewage treatment. Usually, the manganese (III/IV) oxides in the environment are thought to be formed by the oxidation of dissolved Mn(II) through abiotic or biotic processes.          Oxidation of aqueous Mn(II) by dissolved oxygen is thermodynamically favored, but the kinetic is slow due to the high energy barrier of the reaction from dissolved Mn(II) to Mn(III/IV) oxides. The presence of microorganisms accelerates the oxidation rate, which is 4\u20135 orders of magnitude faster than the rate of abiotic chemical oxidation, therefore is considered as the initial source of manganese oxides in the environment.Bacteria capable of catalyzing the oxidation of dissolved Mn(II) ions to undissolved Mn(III/IV) oxides are usually called manganese-oxidizing bacteria. The bacterial oxidation of Mn(II) ions are divided into direct and indirect ways, and the process catalyzed by enzymes on the surface of microorganisms is called direct oxidation. For indirect pathways, some bacteria can change their surrounding environmental conditions for Mn(II) oxidation (e.g., the pH and Eh).Roseobacter clade has been demonstrated to oxidize Mn(II) by producing extracellular reactive oxygen species in recent studies. Do other bacteria clades have similar Mn(II) oxidation processes with Roseobacter? Is the Mn(II) oxidation closely relative to the physiological process of bacteria?To answer these questions, Prof. Feng Zhao from Chinese Academy of Sciences and his team members explored the microbial manganese oxidation process under visible light by using coastal surface seawater microorganisms. The relationship between the transformation of soluble Mn(II) into insoluble Mn(III/IV) oxides by microorganisms and physiological role was analyzed. This study is published in Frontiers of Environmental Science & Engineering in 2023.In this study, the research team found visible light greatly promotes the oxidation rate of Mn(II), and the average rate reaches 64 \u03bcmol/(L\u00b7d). The generated manganese oxides were then conducive to Mn(II) oxidation, thus the rapid manganese oxidation was the result of the combined action of biotic and abiotic, and biological function accounts for 88 % \u00b1 4 %.Extracellular superoxide produced by microorganisms induced by visible light is the decisive factor for the rapid manganese oxidation in our study. But the production of these superoxides does not require the presence of Mn(II) ions, the Mn(II) oxidation process was more like an unintentional side reaction, which did not affect the growth of microorganisms.More than 70 % of heterotrophic microorganisms in nature are capable of producing superoxide, based on the oxidizing properties of free radicals, all these bacteria can participate in the geochemical cycle of manganese. What's more, the superoxide oxidation pathway might be a significant natural source of manganese oxide.This study revealed an essential pathway for bacterial manganese oxidation. Heterotrophic bacteria produce superoxide under visible light irradiation and oxidize Mn(II) ions in the surrounding environment, which is the main source of manganese oxides. The biogenerated Mn(III/IV) oxides can also oxidize Mn(II) ions indirectly through abiotic reactions under light illumination.Many bacteria in the environment that produce superoxide actively or passively may also oxidize Mn(II) in this way, suggesting that the manganese oxidation pathway through superoxide is a common behavior in the environment. In light of the oxidation properties and semiconductor properties of manganese oxides, this research will provide new ideas for the treatment of environmental pollution.

  "text": "Just as a tight core is a component of good physical fitness for humans, helping to stabilize our bodies, mutations that tightened the core of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in new variants may have increased the virus's fitness.          New research led by Penn State reveals that the stem region of the spike protein became progressively tighter over time, and the team thinks this likely improved the virus's ability to transmit through nasal droplets and infect host cells once in the body. The team said the stem region of the protein that emerged in the most recent omicron variants is as rigid as it can get, which could mean that newer vaccines may be effective for longer than the ones that targeted the original variant.\"We wanted to see how the spike protein morphed structurally as it evolved from the original wild-type strain of the virus, through the alpha, delta and most recently omicron variants,\" said Ganesh Anand, associate professor of chemistry and of biochemistry and molecular biology, Penn State.\"We found that the spike protein was initially more flexible at the stem region, which is where the spike protein is bundled together, but over time, mutations caused the protein to become progressively tighter and more rigid, and we think it's now as rigid as it can get. This is important because it means that vaccines that are developed to target the current variant with these rigid spike proteins are likely to be effective for much longer than previous vaccines against the more flexible wild-type strain.\"To study how the spike protein changed with each of the new variants, the team studied the virus in vitro (in a test tube) using a technique called amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry.Anand explained that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is composed of three chain molecules called monomers that are bound together to form a trimer. The spike protein is made up of two subunits, an S1 and S2 subunit. The S1 subunit contains a receptor binding domain while the S2 subunit contains the stem region responsible for bundling the trimer.\"It is analogous to a tree, with the stem forming the trunk and the receptor binding domain forming the branches,\" said Anand.The team's results, which published in the journal eLife, revealed that the spike protein stem first became more rigid with the D614G mutation, which is common to all SARS-CoV-2 variants. The stem became progressively more twisted with the emergence of new mutations in subsequent variants, and the omicron BA.1 variant showed the largest magnitude increase in stabilization relative to preceding variants.      Why would the virus benefit from a tighter core?\"We did not study the virus in patients, so we cannot determine if the changes we observed in the spike protein directly affected the newer variants such as omicron's ability to transmit more readily; however, we can say that the changes likely made the virus more fit, which could translate to better transmission,\" said Anand.\"A tighter core could likely make the virus more stable in nasal droplets and faster at binding to and entering host cells. So, for example, what initially took about 11 days to develop an infection after exposure now takes only about four days.\"Anand noted that one of the reasons the vaccines have not been able to fully neutralize the virus is because they were generated against the spike protein of the original wild-type variant.\"The latest bivalent booster\u2014which targets newer variants\u2014helps, but people who never got this booster aren't receiving this more targeted protection,\" he said. \"Future vaccines that focus specifically on omicron are likely to be effective for longer.\"Finally, Anand said that the spike protein has now become so tightly twisted that it is unlikely to structurally change further at the stem region.\"There are limits to how much it can tighten,\" he said. \"I think that we can have some cautious optimism, in that we're not going to continuously have variants emerging, at least tightening is not going to be a mechanism.\"Other Penn State authors on the paper include chemistry graduate students Sean Braet, Theresa Buckley and Varun Venkatakrishnan.

  "text": "In a study, published in the journal Science China Chemistry and led by Prof. Pingping Fang (School of Chemistry, Zhejiang University) and Prof. Jianfeng Li (College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University), experiments were performed by using an Xplora Raman spectrometer with a 50x microscope objective and an excitation wavelength of 638 nm from a He\u2013Ne laser.          \"Due to the proper adsorption energy of CO on the partially oxidized Ag NWs, it is of great significance to correlate the high ethanol selectivity for CO2 electroreduction with the partially oxidized active center. Ag catalysts have been shown to exhibit high selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to CO at low over potentials with depressed H2 evolution. CO is an important intermediate for C-C coupling, therefore, Ag has the potential to exhibit high selectivity for ethanol products by tuning the adsorption energy of CO. This study provides a new insight to design efficient catalysts and investigate the mechanisms to improve the selectivity,\" Fang says.Interestingly, high ethanol FE was obtained on partially oxidized Ag NWs for CO2 electroreduction, and operando EC-SERS combined with DFT calculation explained the mechanisms why partially oxidized Ag NWs exhibited so high ethanol selectivity. The ethanol FE can reach as high as 85% on partially oxidized Ag NWs at \u22120.95 V vs. RHE. Operando EC-SERS found the high coverage of CO can greatly facilitate the ethanol formation on partially oxidized Ag NWs during CO2 electroreduction.DFT calculation results show that the adsorption energy of CO on the partially oxidized Ag NWs is higher than that on Cu, and the reaction free energy of CO coupling with *CHO to *COCHO intermediate on partially oxidized Ag NWs is smaller than that on Cu surface, which explains the high ethanol selectivity very well.Therefore, experiment results, operando EC-SERS and DFT calculations together prove that such partially oxidized Ag NWs can provide high ethanol selectivity for CO2 electroreduction. These results provide new clues for designing Ag based catalysts to improve the ethanol selectivity and mechanism studies.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the process where heat is transferred by the movement of a heated fluid?",
  "answer_squad": " Convection",
  "text": "A self-propagating chemical reaction can transform a liquid monomer into a solid polymer, and the interaction between the propagating front and the reaction's natural convection leads to patterns in the resulting solid polymeric material. New University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign work has shown how the coupling between natural convection and frontal polymerization leads to those observed patterns.          This research was led by a unique team of researchers: Materials Science and Engineering professor Nancy Sottos, Aerospace Engineering professor Philippe Geubelle, and Mechanical Science and Engineering professor Leonardo Chamorro. A paper describing this research was recently published in Physical Review Letters.Thermoset polymers and composite materials are used in a wide range of industries, but producing such materials requires their being cured at high temperatures in a slow and highly energy intensive process. Frontal polymerization to cure the materials is an attractive alternative approach that is significantly faster and more energy efficient.In frontal polymerization, a self-propagating chemical front converts a liquid monomer into a solid polymer through a reaction that generates a significant amount of heat. Monomers are a simple class of molecular \"building blocks\" that can react to form larger molecules that are polymers. All of the energy needed to create the polymer is contained within the monomer itself, and to harness that energy, only a small stimulus is needed to kick off the reaction.Because of instabilities, that self-propagating front doesn't always move uniformly. Although it is ideal for the front to move smoothly and at a constant speed for applications like composite manufacturing and 3D printing, Geubelle says, \"We're actually very interested in these instabilities because they allow us to generate patterns in the material. That's very exciting, because for some materials, these instabilities can lead to very different properties for the material.\"Geubelle explains that the team's goal was \"to understand, experimentally and computationally, the interaction between the front that is propagating in the monomer bath and the convection that takes place ahead of it, and how the interaction between the two can lead to patterns in the material.\"To visualize and characterize the polymerization front and the recirculation ahead of the front, the team had to design a clever mold that would allow them to make observations through both the top and the side. They constructed and used a glass mold that allowed for the observation of the front from the top and for a laser beam to enter from the side.      They then used particle image velocimetry (PIV) to characterize the velocity field. To use PIV, they needed to seed the fluid with small \"tracer\" particles that would follow the flow and would be tracked by a camera and illuminated by a laser sheet to visualize the patterns in the material. Chamorro says that particle selection was one of the challenges of this work. The team tried various kinds of particles before settling on silver-coated glass particles.They were able to show that as the front propagates and transforms the liquid monomer into the solid polymer, the energy released generates convection. Convection is a process where heat is transferred by the movement of a heated fluid. Like water in the ocean, when a fluid is heated, it expands, and due to buoyancy, the hotter fluid rises because it is less dense, and colder fluid replaces it by sinking to the bottom because it is more dense. This process continues, creating a recirculating flow.The polymerization process gives off a lot of heat, resulting in temperatures over 350\u00b0 F. That heat generated during the transformation goes to the top of the surface. The researchers showed that this was a buoyancy-driven process, and that the recirculation associated with the heat of the reaction, along with the effect of gravity, leads to the formation of the patterning observed in the material and to the impact on the polymerization front. Thanks to the recirculation, the front tends to be inclined rather than perfectly vertical. That inclined front can result in a different speed or cooling effect and even a different patterning effect.Sottos says the experiments revealed that the recirculation not only creates patterns inside the material that affects the material's properties, but \"it also creates surface patterns on the top of the material as well, because the monomer is getting pushed by the recirculating flow.\"The revealed mechanisms of the interaction between the polymerization front and the induced natural convection, and the resulting patterning, represent a deepened understanding of frontal polymerization that may be helpful in the future manufacture of polymeric materials.Other authors on this work include Yuan Gao (postdoc, Beckman Institute and Aerospace Engineering); Justine Paul (graduate student, Beckman Institute and Material Science and Engineering); Manxin Chen (undergraduate student, Beckman Institute and Aerospace Engineering); and Liu Hong (graduate student, Mechanical Science and Engineering).

  "text": "Toxic heavy metals found in wastewater have health and safety ramifications for communities affected by pollution. Hexavalent chromium is a dangerous, cancer-causing byproduct of industrial processes that is known to cause birth defects, severe diarrhea, and is linked to kidney, bladder, and liver cancers. Famously, it was the center of the lawsuit dramatized in the film \"Erin Brockovich.\"          Researchers are trying to find effective ways to remove hexavalent chromium from wastewater and a recently published paper shows how photocatalytic technology may be a solution. Photocatalysis is when light and a catalyst are used to speed up chemical reactions.The paper was published in Polyoxometalates.\"Rapid industrialization causes an increased release of wastewater containing heavy metal ions. Hexavalent chromium, which has high carcinogenicity and teratogenicity, is widely found in wastewater and can easily enter food chains,\" said Yuan-Yuan Ma, a researcher at Hebei Normal University in Shijiazhuang, China. Photocatalysis technology is an appealing solution for removing heavy metals from wastewater because it is sustainable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.\"This green approach for the removal of heavy metal ions uses sustainable light energy via hourglass-type phosphomolybdate-based crystalline photocatalysts and develops a strategy for the regulation of photocatalytic performance by adjusting the central metal ions in hourglass-type phosphomolybdate clusters,\" said Ma. Researchers chose this particular type of photocatalyst because of its molecular properties and well-defined hourglass-type structure, which give it a wide light absorption ability and the band structure necessary to reduce the levels of hexavalent chromium.Researchers tested four \"hybrid\" photocatalysts and compared them to six other photocatalysts. The hybrids had slightly different compositions, but all had the same hourglass-type structure that could be maintained up to 200 degrees Celsius. They had wide visible-light absorption and similar energy band structures. Researchers labeled these as Hybrid 1, 2, 3, and 4. After 80 minutes of exposure to a 10W LED light, hybrid 1 and 3 had around a 90% reduction in hexavalent chromium, while 2 and 4 had around a 74% and 71% reduction in hexavalent chromium respectively.The hybrids generally performed better than any of the tested photocatalysts. Hybrids 1 and 3, which performed best, both were Mn{P4MO6}2-based hybrids. Hybrids 2 and 4 were Co{P4MO6}2-based. Researchers suspect that the better performance was due to structural differences that gave hybrids 1 and 3 a narrower band gap. \"The semiconductor photocatalysts in photocatalytic processes can absorb photons matched with their band gap energy, leading to the conversion of toxic hexavalent chromium to less toxic chromium,\" said Ma.Looking ahead, researchers will focus on improving the design of the photocatalysts, while also planning for how to best bring this technology to a real-world wastewater setting. \"Designing effective photocatalysts is the first step to solve heavy metal pollution in water,\" said Ma. \"We will design more efficient photocatalysts and apply the developed photocatalysts to actual industrial wastewater. We will also expand the treatment range of polluted water sources and strive to realize the practicality of the photocatalyst materials used.\" More information:Xiao-Yu Yin et al, Photoactive hourglass-type M{P 4Mo 6} 2 networks for efficient removal of hexavalent chromium, Polyoxometalates (2023).

  "answer_squad": " Haber-Bosch",
  "text": "The Haber-Bosch (HB) process is one of the most important industrial chemical reactions. It combines nitrogen and hydrogen gases in the presence of an iron-based catalyst at high temperatures and pressures to produce ammonia fertilizer which helps provide food for over five billion people.          Over the decades, researchers have tried to bring down the reaction temperature of the HB process to increase the ammonia yield while reducing energy consumption. To this end, they have recently developed new catalysts based on other transition metals, such as ruthenium, cobalt, and nickel, which exhibit much higher catalytic activity than iron.However, these catalysts preferentially adsorb hydrogen atoms onto their surface at low temperatures of 100\u2013150oC, which reduces nitrogen adsorption and thus hampers ammonia production. This phenomenon, known as hydrogen poisoning, poses an obstacle to the low-temperature HB process.In this light, researchers led by Professor Michikazu Hara of the Laboratory for Materials and Structures at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), have refocused on iron-based catalysts and modified them to produce ammonia at 100oC. Their work is all set to be published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.Prof. Hara explains the motivation behind the research. \"Hydrogen poisoning is not strong for iron-based catalysts. Therefore, they may be used for the low-temperature HB process but only when combined with an appropriate promoter that increases their catalytic activity.\" In this work, the researchers prepared metallic iron (Fe) nanoparticles on calcium hydride (CaH2) particles, with a mixture of barium oxide (BaO) and barium hydride (BaH2) deposited on them.A set of experiments revealed that the iron nanoparticles interact strongly with the hydride ions of both hydrides. As a result, hydrogen atoms move from the hydrides to the nanoparticles and get desorbed as hydrogen gas, leaving behind electrons. The hydrides donate these electrons to the iron nanoparticles. It facilitates the breaking of nitrogen gas into atoms, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity for ammonia production even at low temperatures.The BaH2\u2013BaO/Fe/CaH2 catalyst exhibited a turnover frequency of 0.23 s-1 at 100oC and 12.3 s-1 at 300oC under a moderate pressure of 0.9 MPa. These values, orders of magnitude higher than those for catalysts based on other transition metals, result from the ability of iron to prevent hydrogen poisoning by desorbing the adsorbed hydrogen atoms as hydrogen gas at low temperatures.Discussing the future potential of their work, Prof. Hara observes, \"The BaH2\u2013BaO/Fe/CaH2 catalyst facilitates low-temperature HB process, which consumes less energy. As such, it can reduce the use of fossil fuels and potentially lower global carbon emissions. In addition, iron is abundant and inexpensive, which makes the HB process more sustainable.\" More information:Michikazu Hara et al, Low temperature ammonia synthesis on iron catalyst with an electron donor, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2023).

  "text": "Hydrogen production powered by wind and solar energy is still too expensive if it is to play a role in the clean transition via energy storage and to help decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors. Much effort in reducing its cost focuses on enhancing production efficiency by improving the performance of iridium-based catalysts that can speed up the oxygen-related part of the electrochemical reaction involved in splitting water into its component parts, hydrogen and oxygen.          A new review of the state of the field discusses its recent progress and challenges and identifies research gaps that need to be filled before such catalysts can achieve commercial viability.The review paper was published in the journal Nano Research Energy.Cleanly produced hydrogen is essential in the transition away from fossil fuels in order to avoid dangerous climate change, both as an energy carrier to be used on its own or as a component of a synthetic fuel for those sections of the economy such as long-haul shipping and aviation that are hard to electrify.But such clean hydrogen production\u2014which is performed via electrolysis, using electricity to split water into its component elements, hydrogen and oxygen\u2014is extremely energy intensive. This energy intensity of electrolysis in turn makes clean production of hydrogen very expensive, and thus uncompetitive with fossil fuels.If this were not enough of a challenge, using wind and solar energy as the source of clean electricity to power the electrolysis\u2014a form of hydrogen production termed 'green hydrogen'\u2014places a significant burden on the electrolyzers because these energy sources are intermittent. The sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow.This means that sometimes there is little to no current and at other times, there can be a big spike of current, which places stress on the electrolyzers, again pushing up costs. However, proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) are a very promising option here, as PEMWEs can operate at high current densities such as those posed by these spikes.Electrolysis is a chemical reaction composed of two parts, or 'half reactions.' One is the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which generates the hydrogen, and the other is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which produces the oxygen. But it is actually the latter reaction that is most important with respect to the energy efficiency of the overall process and thus production of clean hydrogen.      And so to reduce the energy demands and thus the cost of clean production of hydrogen, a lot of research has focused on superior catalysts\u2014chemicals that speed up a chemical reaction\u2014for the OER part of the process and that pair well with PEMWEs.However, the severe corrosion in the acidic environment of PEMWEs makes most non-precious metal-based catalysts\u2014for example using cobalt, nickel, or iron\u2014unstable. But iridium-based catalysts exhibit much better catalytic stability in these harsh acidic conditions.A number of recent studies have reported significant advances in the development of iridium-based catalysts for green hydrogen production, including the use of new synthesis methods and the optimization of catalyst structures and compositions.However, there are still several research challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of iridium-based catalysts for green hydrogen production. One major challenge is the high cost of iridium\u2014and high costs are precisely what novel catalysts were intended to avoid.\"To overcome this, researchers are exploring new synthesis methods and alternative catalyst materials that can replace iridium or reduce the amount of iridium required,\" said Chunyun Wang, of the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Yangzhou University and lead author of the review. \"Some novel and effective options have emerged recently, such as iridium oxides, perovskites, pyrochlores, and single-atom catalysts.\"\"And so we thought it was about time that we paused and assessed the state of play in iridium-based catalysts for green hydrogen production with a review paper,\" added Alex Schechter, a chemist with Ariel University in Israel and co-author of the review paper. \"The benefit of this is to pool information across many different teams of researchers and, crucially, identify research gaps.\"The review focuses in particular on how the catalysis operates (the catalytic mechanism), design of catalysts, and strategies for synthesis of catalysts. In particular, the analysis looks at different attributes of catalysts that affect their promotion of the catalysis process including geometric effects, electronic effects, synergistic effects, defect engineering and support effects, and how different research teams have dealt with each option to try to improve performance.Geometric effects in essence describe the shape, structure and size of the catalyst molecule, including which of its crystal planes are exposed, and how atomic arrangements might be ordered or disordered. All of this significantly affects catalyst performance. Electronic effects refer to the structure of electrons associated with the relevant molecules.Synergistic effects are those where two or more ingredients come together to produce a superior result than either one on its own. Defect engineering involves efforts to design the surface chemistry of catalysts via voids, dislocations, vacancies and so on\u2014deliberately introducing imperfections\u2014so as to increase the number of places where the chemical reaction can take place (active sites). And support effects come from metals that interact with and support the catalyst.The reviewers concluded after surveying their field that the most successful strategy for improving the performance of iridium-based catalysts includes defect engineering, adjusting synergistic effects and altering geometric effects. The number of exposed active sites can be increased by constructing a porous structure and introducing supports for the catalyst that promote transfer of both mass and electrons. And enhanced metal-support interaction can increase the long-term stability of the catalysts.Despite the considerable research success, the field still faces challenges. Many high-performance iridium-based catalysts have been developed, but most of them can only be synthesized on a small scale of just a few grams or even hundreds of milligrams in the laboratory. Complex preparation processes thus must be simplified.In addition, lab conditions are a bit too ideal compared to actual catalytic systems, and so real-world conditions need to be part of any follow-up research. This includes looking at realistic electrolyzer temperature, current density, and product delivery, amongst other aspects, that will enable evaluation of performance catalysts in practical applications.And beyond the catalysts themselves, other components need to be optimized as well, including the development of electrode plates with high corrosion resistance and low cost, proton exchange membranes with high proton transport capacity.The reviewers stressed however that none of these challenges are deal-breakers for iridium-based catalysts for green hydrogen production. Instead these represent possible avenues for new research that may deliver the breakthroughs this process requires to achieve commercial viability.

  "text": "A common amino acid, glycine, can deliver a \"slow-down\" signal to the brain, likely contributing to major depression, anxiety and other mood disorders in some people, scientists at the Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology have found.          The discovery, outlined Thursday in the journal Science, improves understanding of the biological causes of major depression and could accelerate efforts to develop new, faster-acting medications for such hard-to-treat mood disorders, said neuroscientist Kirill Martemyanov, Ph.D., corresponding author of the study.\"Most medications for people with depression take weeks before they kick in, if they do at all. New and better options are really needed,\" said Martemyanov, who chairs the neuroscience department at the institute in Jupiter.Major depression is among the world's most urgent health needs. Its numbers have surged in recent years, especially among young adults. As depression's disability, suicide numbers and medical expenses have climbed, a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2021 put its economic burden at $326 billion annually in the United States.Martemyanov said he and his team of students and postdoctoral researchers have spent many years working toward this discovery. They didn't set out to find a cause, much less a possible treatment route for depression. Instead, they asked a basic question: How do sensors on brain cells receive and transmit signals into the cells? Therein lay the key to understanding vision, pain, memory, behavior and possibly much more, Martemyanov suspected.\"It's amazing how basic science goes. Fifteen years ago we discovered a binding partner for proteins we were interested in, which led us to this new receptor,\" Martemyanov said. \"We've been unspooling this for all this time.\"In 2018 the Martemyanov team found the new receptor was involved in stress-induced depression. If mice lacked the gene for the receptor, called GPR158, they proved surprisingly resilient to chronic stress.      That offered strong evidence that GPR158 could be therapeutic target, he said. But what sent the signal?A breakthrough came in 2021, when his team solved the structure of GPR158. What they saw surprised them. The GPR158 receptor looked like a microscopic clamp with a compartment\u2014akin to something they had seen in bacteria, not human cells.\"We were barking up the completely wrong tree before we saw the structure,\" Martemyanov said. \"We said, 'Wow, that's an amino acid receptor. There are only 20, so we screened them right away and only one fit perfectly. That was it. It was glycine.\"That wasn't the only odd thing. The signaling molecule was not an activator in the cells, but an inhibitor. The business end of GPR158 connected to a partnering molecule that hit the brakes rather than the accelerator when bound to glycine.\"Usually receptors like GPR158, known as G protein Coupled Receptors, bind G proteins. This receptor was binding an RGS protein, which is a protein that has the opposite effect of activation,\" said Thibaut Laboute, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher from Martemyanov's group and first author of the study.Scientists have been cataloging the role of cell receptors and their signaling partners for decades. Those that still don't have known signalers, such as GPR158, have been dubbed \"orphan receptors.\"The finding means that GPR158 is no longer an orphan receptor, Laboute said. Instead, the team renamed it mGlyR, short for \"metabotropic glycine receptor.\"\"An orphan receptor is a challenge. You want to figure out how it works,\" Laboute said. \"What makes me really excited about this discovery is that it may be important for people's lives. That's what gets me up in the morning.\"Laboute and Martemyanov are listed as inventors on a patent application describing methods to study GPR158 activity. Martemyanov is a cofounder of Blueshield Therapeutics, a startup company pursuing GPR158 as a drug target.Glycine itself is sold as a nutritional supplement billed as improving mood. It is a basic building block of proteins and affects many different cell types, sometimes in complex ways. In some cells, it sends slow-down signals, while in other cell types, it sends excitatory signals. Some studies have linked glycine to the growth of invasive prostate cancer.More research is needed to understand how the body maintains the right balance of mGlyR receptors and how brain cell activity is affected, he said. He intends to keep at it.\"We are in desperate need of new depression treatments,\" Martemyanov said. \"If we can target this with something specific, it makes sense that it could help. We are working on it now.\" More information:Thibaut Laboute et al, Orphan receptor GPR158 serves as a metabotropic glycine receptor: mGlyR, Science (2023).

  "text": "Researchers at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP) in Brazil have developed a kraft paper-based electrochemical sensor that can detect traces of pesticides in fruit and vegetables in real time when coupled to an electronic device. In an apple or cabbage, for example, it can detect carbendazim, a fungicide widely used in Brazil despite being banned.          The results are reported in an article published in the journal Food Chemistry.\"To find out whether a food sample contains traces of pesticides by conventional methods, you must grind up the sample and submit it to time-consuming chemical processes before any such substances can be detected. Wearable sensors like the one we developed for continuous monitoring of pesticides in agriculture and the food industry eliminate the need for these complex processes. Inspection is much easier, cheaper and reliable for a supermarket, restaurant or importer, for example,\" said Osvaldo Novais de Oliveira Junior, penultimate author of the article and a professor at IFSC-USP.The new device is highly sensitive and resembles the glucometers used by diabetics to measure blood sugar, except that the results of food scanning for pesticides are displayed on a smartphone. \"In the tests we performed, its sensitivity was similar to the conventional method's. Plus, it's fast and inexpensive,\" said Jos\u00e9 Luiz Bott Neto, corresponding author of the article and a postdoctoral fellow at IFSC-USP.How it worksThe device consists basically of a paper substrate modified with carbon ink and submitted to electrochemical treatment in an acid medium to activate carboxyl groups and make detection possible, Bott Neto explained.\"We use the silkscreen process to transfer carbon-conducting ink to a strip of kraft paper, thereby creating a device based on electrochemistry. It has three carbon electrodes and is immersed in an acidic solution to activate the carboxyl groups. In other words, oxygen atoms are added to the structure of the carbon electrode. When it comes into contact with a sample contaminated with carbendazim, the sensor induces an electrochemical oxidation reaction that permits detection of the fungicide. The quantity of carbendazim is measured via electrical current,\" he said.In developing the device, the researchers evaluated the stability and structure of the paper substrate. \"The properties of the paper itself were an important part of our research,\" said Thiago Serafim Martins, first author of the article and a postdoctoral fellow at IFSC-USP.Best optionThe researchers analyzed kraft paper and parchment, finding both types of paper to be stable enough to serve as a substrate for the sensor. However, the porousness of kraft paper conferred more sensitivity on the sensor and the carboxyl groups formed during electrochemical activation, Martins explained, adding that paper-based electrodes could be used in many applications.\"There are commercial electrodes made of plastic or ceramic material. We successfully developed electrochemical sensors based on paper, a much more malleable material and therefore potentially useful in many areas, not just on farms or in supermarkets, but also in healthcare, for example,\" he said.

  "text": "Photocatalysis is the use of light to accelerate the rate of a reaction in the presence of a photocatalyst. The catalyst plays a crucial role in this process\u2014it absorbs the light being shined onto it and makes it available in ways that can help accelerate the chemical reaction and also enhance it. These catalysts are used for a variety of light-dependent reactions ranging from the production of paper to the conversion of carbon dioxide to fuel.          Given these applications, the development of ideal photocatalysts is important. An ideal photocatalyst is one that uses a single transition metal that performs both visible light absorption and chemical transformation. Currently, visible light-driven single transition metal catalysts are limited to only one mechanism of operation, known as the radical mechanism, or have a low light-harvesting ability, making them heavily dependent on certain substrates. Thus, there is a need for an ideal single transition metal catalyst that solves these problems.A team of researchers from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), led by Assistant Professor Yuki Nagashima, have reported a novel visible light-driven single transition metal catalyst that solves these issues. Their findings are published in Nature Synthesis. Dr. Nagashima explains, \"We envisioned unprecedented rhodium (Rh)-based photocatalysts\u2014spiro-fluorene-indenoindenyl (SFI)-Rh(I) complexes\u2014that combine high light harvesting abilities with broad applicability.\"The team found that extending the molecules around the central Rh atom\u2014called the ligand\u2014is necessary to increase the light harvesting abilities of these complexes, but also makes them less stable. Thus, the team designed SFI-Rh(I) complexes using a non-fused extension strategy, extending the molecules around the ligand without compromising the stability of the resultant catalyst.In fact, their extension strategy made the catalyst stable against protonation and helped in increasing its light-harvesting ability, thus reducing its substrate dependence. The catalyst was also designed to be able to perform using multiple mechanisms, beyond the radical mechanism used by previous catalysts.\"The careful design of our catalyst enabled it to have many advantages compared to previously described catalysts, while making it suitable for complex reactions. The SFI-Rh(I) complexes can easily extend the scope of typical Rh-catalyzed reactions using blue light LED irradiation at room temperature. This opens many avenues for future applications of these catalysts, as well as photocatalytic reactions in general,\" says Nagashima.\"We believe that this catalyst has the potential to be a versatile light-driven catalyst that can break through the ground-state limitations in various photoreactions.\" More information:Yuki Nagashima, Design, synthesis and visible-light-induced non-radical reactions of dual-functional Rh catalysts, Nature Synthesis (2023).

  "text": "Osaka Metropolitan University scientists have developed a process using artificial photosynthesis to successfully convert more than 60% of waste acetone into 3-hydroxybutyrate, a material used to manufacture biodegradable plastic. The results were obtained using low-concentration CO2, equivalent to exhaust gas, and powered by light equivalent to sunlight for 24 hours.          The researchers expect that this innovative way of producing biodegradable plastic could not only reduce CO2 emissions but also provide a way of reusing laboratory and industrial waste acetone. Their findings have been published in the journal Green Chemistry.Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate\u2014a biodegradable plastic\u2014is a strong water-resistant polyester often used in packaging materials, made from 3-hydroxybutyrate as a precursor. In previous studies, a research team led by Professor Yutaka Amao from the Research Center for Artificial Photosynthesis at Osaka Metropolitan University found that 3-hydroxybutyrate can be synthesized from CO2 and acetone with high efficiency, but this was only demonstrated at higher concentrations of CO2 or sodium bicarbonate.This new study aimed to reuse waste acetone from permanent marker ink and low concentrations of CO2\u2014equivalent to exhaust gas from power plants, chemical plants, or steel factories. Acetone is a relatively inexpensive and reasonably harmless chemical used in many different laboratory settings, either for reactions or as a cleaning agent, which produces waste acetone. The acetone and CO2 acted as raw materials to synthesize 3-hydroxybutyrate using artificial photosynthesis, powered by light equivalent to sunlight.\"We focused our attention on the importance of using CO2 created by exhaust gas from thermal power plants and other sources to demonstrate the practical application of artificial photosynthesis,\" explained Professor Amao.After 24 hours, more than 60% of acetone had been successfully converted to 3-hydroxybutyrate. \"In the future, we aim to develop artificial photosynthesis technology further, so that it can use acetone from liquid waste and as well as exhaust gas from the laboratory as raw materials,\" stated Professor Amao.

  "text": "A breakthrough in synthesis strategy enables the facile formulation of inorganic membranes that are not just energy-efficient but also highly customizable, potentially revolutionizing the way many industries operate for greater sustainability.          Inorganic membranes can be thought of as kitchen sieves. Similar to how sieves separate smaller particles from larger ones, inorganic membranes, typically made of ceramics or metals, selectively separate molecules based on their size and properties.In a ground-breaking achievement, a team of researchers from the College of Design and Engineering (CDE) at the National University of Singapore, led by Professor Ho Ghim Wei from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, has developed a revolutionary technique for producing ultrathin inorganic membranes. These freestanding membranes can function without any supporting substrate\u2014a significant advancement in membrane technology. The team's findings were published in the scientific journal Nature on March 29, 2023.Highly customizable and simple to produce, the inorganic membranes\u2014underpinned by a universal, facile synthesis strategy\u2014have the potential to benefit applications beyond filtration and separation. From energy conversion to catalysis and sensing, the membranes' versatility could transform various sectors and industries that depend on membrane technology. By promoting efficiency and sustainability in industrial processes, the NUS scientists' pioneering research has unveiled new possibilities for overcoming energy challenges in the face of climate change.Membranes reimaginedConventional membrane technologies used in purification and separation processes are known to be energy-intensive and therefore expensive, often entailing a combination of pressure, heat, and sometimes chemicals to function effectively. Moreover, the membranes must be regenerated, while the filtered components usually require further treatment after separation, leading to additional energy demands and costs.Such limitations of traditional membrane technologies served as the impetus for postdoctoral research fellow Dr. Zhang Chen in Prof Ho's team to develop a new synthesis strategy for highly efficient inorganic membranes. Dr. Zhang's method involves taming chaotic, free-floating, inorganic building-blocks in a liquid environment, coaxing them to self-assemble into the desired membrane. This tunable process provides an effective means to tailor the membrane's thickness and pore characteristics for specific applications, achieving maximum energy efficiency.\"Our study has also allowed us to take a fresh approach to rethink how inorganic membranes are traditionally developed,\" added Dr. Zhang.The NUS scientists have presented a synthesis template that other researchers can utilize for their work, which could spur the discovery of more novel membranes with a wider compositional range in a scalable and cost-effective manner.From a structural perspective, the membranes they produced have more geometric diversity than conventional ones, providing more flexibility and options when designing membrane structures.Additionally, the study also explores membrane functionality, where highly selective 2D barriers are used to control energy flow across the membrane. This feature could influence how the membrane functions\u2014allowing ions to be filtered based on their charge, different forms of energy such as thermal, electrical, or light to be harnessed, or specific molecules to be selectively concentrated. Such flexibility is highly desirable in various energy-related applications, including fuel cells and solar energy conversion.\"Our new technique has the potential to transform industries that heavily rely on membranes for their operation, particularly those related to energy or the environment,\" said Prof Ho. \"The ability to create freestanding inorganic membranes that are highly selective opens up numerous exciting possibilities for applications in advanced spatial dynamic separation, catalysis, sensors, memories, and ionic conductors, all of which represent unprecedented developments.\"      Formulating a greener future With an emphasis on efficiency and customization, the researchers' innovation plays a key role in NUS' sustainability initiatives, greatly reducing the energy consumption of membrane-related processes worldwide and cutting the carbon footprint of various industries as a result.Driven by the potential of the breakthrough, Prof Ho plans to lead an interdisciplinary team of scientists in a multi-faceted research program to advance membrane technology to the next level. \"By exploring the vast range of membrane compositions and coupling them with various forms of energy, we hope to unlock new applications and make further strides towards a more sustainable future,\" shared Prof Ho.The team is also looking to develop automated manufacturing tools to streamline the production process of inorganic membranes, ultimately making their technology more accessible on a larger scale.

  "answer_squad": " BIGTUNA",
  "text": "Microbes may be among the smallest living things on Earth, but bioimaging to understand the chemistry that fuels these organisms could reveal important clues about the intricacies of gene function and the health of the planet. Because of this, scientists have long sought ways to eavesdrop on conversations between living microbes in their environment.          This has been exceptionally difficult, in part because microbes communicate using molecules instead of words. Deciphering conversations means identifying small, specific, and quickly changing molecules called metabolites, something even the most powerful instruments struggle to attempt. But a team of researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have spent the last decade continuously developing a next-generation bioimaging instrument that is making progress toward this goal.The Chemical Dynamics Initiative (CDi), an internal PNNL investment, supported PNNL chemist Patrick El Khoury and his team as they developed the technology to measure phenomena in the quantum realm. Here the team imaged subatomic waves of energy called phonons as they formed, beat, and dissipated in a single trillionth of a second.\"Similar technologies can be used to image phonons and metabolites in real space and real time,\" said El Khoury. \"The fundamental advances required in both areas comprise a challenge worthy of a national laboratory and continued investments.\"Now researchers are taking the technologies to the next level as they use bioimaging to map metabolites exchanged by live microbes.Bioimaging to fish out whispers in a crowdThe bioimager is known as BIGTUNA, short for BioImaginG Technology Using Nano-optical Approach. The keys to BIGTUNA are its multiple optical capabilities, each providing complementary information about the position and composition of molecules in a study sample. Many laser sources focus on the tip of a very sharp nanosized needle. Researchers position the needle's tip in the sample area they want to examine, then use the light focused on the tip of the needle to measure the sample's physical and chemical features. Through this, researchers identify molecules and understand how they interact.                One of the custom-built nano-optical system precursors to the BIGTUNA bioimaging device. Credit: Patrick El-Khoury, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory             Chemical bioimaging with light has been done for a hundred years, but never at this molecular scale.\"Some methods illuminate a relatively large area, but these far-field approaches are like listening in to a crowd and expecting to understand individual conversations,\" said PNNL chemist Scott Lea. To overcome this challenge, researchers focused on combining a wide range of near-field techniques to capture and characterize the maximum information in an area as small as a few molecules.\"If we don't have multiple streams of data coming from multiple techniques, we only get partial information,\" said El Khoury. \"And in addition to developing the techniques, we developed our understanding of optical selection rules to maximize the information we get from one sample in one set-up.\"In the most recent iteration of this project, the researchers zoomed out to a larger area, although still only a thousandth the thickness of a strand of hair. At this slightly farther distance, they identified the most promising approaches to capture information about the patterns of molecular bonds and the distribution of electrons. These new nano-optical measurements are addressing a much smaller number of molecules; therefore, the researchers must continue developing new theories that describe nanoscopic interactions of light and matter.Combining these conceptual and technological developments will allow the researchers to move beyond model systems they studied using early incarnations of BIGTUNA. The chemical signals in these model systems were much stronger than chemical signals from the metabolites involved in microbial communications. In addition to having weaker signals, biological samples are also susceptible to damage by light, which is why BIGTUNA's noninvasive approach makes it ideal to develop for bioimaging applications. Including state-of-the art data and computational techniques from PNNL data scientists Sarah Akers and Edo Apr\u00e0 will help automate where and how the instrument balances exploration with the sensitivity of a living system.      Bioimaging to tune in to talking microbesAs an initial foray into biology, researchers are focusing BIGTUNA's bioimaging power on a community of symbiotic microbes that live in deep ocean sediments. One microbe reduces sulfur, the other oxidizes methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.                Image of the microbe community (purple and green) within sediment particles (yellow) that researchers are studying through bioimaging with BIGTUNA. Credit: Patrick El Khoury, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory             Previous approaches to unraveling microbial interactions have mainly focused on identifying influential genes or on examining isolated enzymes and pathways. The approaches often include fixing, freezing, or combining the biological system. But these approaches lose out on time-dependent or space-specific details. And the researchers can't look at the flow of metabolites to get a predictive understanding of how and why microbes interact.Even so, PNNL collaborator and CalTech geologist Victoria Orphan has theories about how these symbiotic microbes share metabolites. Bioimaging with BIGTUNA could produce the first close-up view of the metabolites in action as the instrument sends light through the sample and measures what gets absorbed or scattered. Researchers use the information to identify metabolites and create a detailed record of microbial intercellular communication pathways. In turn, this knowledge could help researchers understand the degree to which microbes respond to environmental changes.A new generation of nano-optics\"Possibilities for BIGTUNA extend far beyond the realm of bioimaging,\" said Peter Sushko, CDi's chief scientist. \"Because this highly adaptable instrument can obtain detailed information describing atomic motion and electronic processes, it will be useful in seeking answers to a broad range of questions that are of interest to chemists, physicists, and materials scientists as well.\"Potential applications include quantum materials, catalysis, and human health, in addition to the current work in microbial systems. In that realm, planned future developments could incorporate environmental controls to further generalize the approach.A portion of the blueprint for BIGTUNA was designed under PNNL's CDi, a five-year internal investment in capabilities to better understand and predict the evolution of complex chemical systems in real-world or operational environments.

  "answer_squad": " Mixing state",
  "text": "Particles in the atmosphere affect global climate. For example, the black carbon from burning fossil fuels absorbs and radiates light and heat. To calculate the effects of aerosols on climate, scientists rely on simulated aerosol fields. How these models represent aerosol mixing state potentially introduces large uncertainties into climate calculations. This is because the simulated aerosol optical properties\u2014how particles absorb and scatter light\u2014are sensitive to mixing state. Mixing state refers to how various properties are distributed across the particles in the air.          In a new study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, researchers have systematically quantified the effect of aerosol mixing state on aerosol optical properties. To do so, they used an ensemble of 1,800 aerosol populations from different particle-resolved simulations. These complex simulations operate on the scale of single particles.Investigating the impacts of aerosol mixing state on aerosol optical properties is important for both modeling and experimental studies. This new paper approaches this topic by using particle-resolved simulations as a benchmark. It applies this benchmark to determine the error in optical properties when using simplified aerosol representations. These simplified representations are common in state-of-the-art aerosol models. The researchers disentangled the causes for biases in the prediction of optical properties that are introduced by assuming that particles mix within prescribed size bins. Some of these errors are large enough to warrant caution when calculating how particles directly affect climate.Within the study, a research team systematically quantified the errors introduced by internal mixture assumptions used in sectional aerosol models. The internal mixture assumption generally led to an overestimation of the volume absorption coefficients and an underestimation of the volume scattering coefficients. The relative errors for \u03f5(\u03b2abs) and \u03f5(\u03b2scat) reached as high as 70% and \u221232%, respectively. The absorption overestimation and scattering underestimation resulted in a consistent underestimation of single scattering albedo, with errors as great as \u221222.3% and median errors of \u22120.9%. The relative error in the volume absorption coefficient \u03f5(\u03b2abs) displayed a similar pattern for relative humidity of 50% and 90% compared to the dry environment. The relative error in the volume scattering coefficient \u03f5(\u03b2scat) decreased at higher relative humidity because of the enhanced scattering cross-section through hygroscopic growth.The team included researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the Japan Meteorological Agency, the Japanese National Institute of Polar Research, the Japanese Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

  "text": "An ancient biological enzyme known as nickel-iron hydrogenase may play a key role in producing hydrogen for a renewables-based energy economy, researchers have found. Careful study of the enzyme has led chemists from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to design a synthetic molecule that mimics the hydrogen gas-producing chemical reaction performed by the enzyme.          The researchers reported their findings in the journal Nature Communications.Currently, industrial hydrogen is usually produced by separating hydrogen gas molecules from oxygen atoms in water using a process called electrolysis. To boost this chemical reaction in the industrial setting, platinum metal is used as a catalyst in the cathodes that direct the reaction. However, many studies have shown that the expense and rarity of platinum make it unattractive as the world pushes toward more environmentally sound energy sources.On the other hand, nature's nickel-iron hydrogenase enzyme produces hydrogen using earth-abundant metals in its core, said chemistry professor Liviu Mirica, who led the study with graduate student Sagnik Chakrabarti.\"The nickel at the core of the natural enzyme produces hydrogen by reducing protons in water,\" Chakrabarti said. \"During the catalytic process, the nickel center goes through paramagnetic intermediates, meaning that the intermediates have an unpaired electron\u2014which makes them extremely short-lived.\"Synthetic chemists have made nickel compounds that produce hydrogen for over a decade, Mirica said. While some of these compounds are very efficient at producing hydrogen, the vast majority of them operate via intermediates that are not paramagnetic.\"Researchers are trying to mimic exactly what nature does because it is efficient, and maximizing efficiency is a key challenge to overcome when engineering energy sources,\" Mirica said. \"Being able to reproduce the paramagnetic intermediate steps that occur in the natural enzyme is what our group is trying to achieve\u2014to increase efficiency and mimic nature.\"To achieve this, the team designed an organic molecule called a ligand that contains electron-donating atoms like nitrogen and sulfur, and can hold the nickel in place and support the two relevant paramagnetic states that produce hydrogen. The key design element that sets this molecule apart from other catalysts is the presence of a carbon-hydrogen bond near the nickel center that is broken and formed again during catalysis. This was crucial in stabilizing the aforementioned paramagnetic states.\"One of the key takeaways from our work is that by using the specially designed ligand in the manner we did, we have successfully united ideas from two fields of inorganic chemistry\u2014bioinorganic and organometallic chemistry\u2014to make nickel complexes that behave similarly to the active site of one of nature's most beautiful and complicated enzymes,\" Chakrabarti said.In the recent past, several unusual enzymes have been found that feature metal-carbon bonds in their active sites, the researchers said. Such design principles in synthetic complexes could lead to further insights into how nature performs chemistry with small molecules like hydrogen.Former Illinois researchers Soumalya Sinha, Giang N. Tran and Hanah Na contributed to this study.

Therefore, the introduction of non-metal heteroatoms can effectively modulate the electronic structure and chemical properties of the materials and produce rich active sites to improve catalytic performance.In this study, researchers prepared Co@NPC and applied it in the aqueous hydrogenation reaction of cinnamaldehyde. The catalyst was coated by the carbon layer during the synthesis process (hydrothermal and calcination). Once the carbon formed a coating layer, it could prevent the metal from sintering, leaching and growing up. This structure displayed highly dispersed abundant active sites, thus contributing to the excellent activity catalyst performance.Co@NPC exhibited excellent performance in reaction. It can achieve 92.1% conversion of cinnamaldehyde and 79.7% selectivity of cinnamaldehyde respectively under the reaction conditions of 80\u2103, 0.5 MPa hydrogen pressure and 5 h. Compared with the catalyst Co@C without doping, N, P co-doping can significantly improve the catalytic performance and control the activity and selectivity of the reaction by adjusting the doping amount.In addition, the researchers proved that P doping could improve the selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol, while N doping was closely related to the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed that the electronegativity difference between N, P and C atoms led to the interaction between electrons and changed the ratio of Co and CoO in the catalyst, thereby changing the adsorption strength of cinnamaldehyde on the surface of the catalyst. The reaction products can be adjusted according to the difference of adsorption energy.This study showed that doping of non-metallic atoms made it possible to regulate the electronic structure of catalyst, which provides a new strategy for the design of catalyst for selective hydrogenation of biomass derivatives.

  "text": "Aramid fiber is known as \"super fiber,\" or \"golden silk,\" because even though its weight is equivalent to only 20% of the weight of steel, it is more than five times as strong and does not burn, even at 500\u00b0C. Aramid fiber is an essential material used in various applications such as body armor, fire-resistant clothing, fiber optic cable reinforcement, high-performance tires, and aerospace materials. The late Dr. Han-Sik Yun began researching aramid fiber at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in 1979 and secured independent source technology in 1984.       Dr. Dae-Yoon Kim and his research team at the Functional Composite Materials Research Center within the KIST Jeonbuk Institute of Advanced Composite Materials announced that they have applied carbon nanotubes to aramid fibers to develop a new kind of composite fiber. The findings are published in the journal Advanced Fiber Materials.In addition to being lightweight, strong, and fire-resistant, the fiber also has electrical conductivity, which is a first for conventional aramid fibers. The newly developed fiber is black in color due to the presence of carbon nanotubes.                Mechanical and electrical properties of \"black fiber.\" Credit: Korea Institute of Science and Technology             Inspired by the characteristics of a silkworm cocoon, the KIST research team succeeded in combining aramid, which has extremely low dispersibility, with carbon nanotubes. By utilizing the liquid crystal phase, silkworms produce high-strength fiber using high-concentration protein. Possessing both liquid-like fluidity and crystal-like order, the liquid crystal minimizes the coagulation of aramid and carbon nanotubes as well as improves the alignment.Utilizing these characteristics, the research team created a new type of composite fiber with high level of specific strength similar to that of existing commercial aramid fibers, as well as a specific electrical conductivity level of approximately 90% of that of copper wires.

Credit: Korea Institute of Science and Technology             Despite these electrical characteristics, this next-generation aramid fiber does not use any metals, resulting in flexibility, non-corrosiveness, and a lightweight profile (approximately 30% of the weight of copper wires). It is expected to be used as a next-generation wire in various applications, such as smart military, medical robots, eco-friendly mobility, and aerospace technologies.

  "text": "A team of chemical engineers affiliated with several institutions in Europe has determined why Old Masters of the 16th, 17th, and early 18th centuries added egg yolk to their oil-based paints. In their study, reported in the journal Nature Communications, the group added fresh egg yolk to the types of oils used by Renaissance painters and tested them to see changes it made to their properties.       For many years, historians have known that the Old Masters of the Renaissance, such as Sandro Botticelli or Leonardo da Vinci, added proteins such as egg yolk to their oil-based paints\u2014creating a medium known as egg tempera\u2014but no one knew why. In this new effort, the chemists set themselves the task of solving the mystery.The work involved creating two types of oil-based paints, both with yolk added. One mixture consisted of nothing but yolk and oil. The other had yolk, oil and pigments to add coloring. The team also created similar paints without using egg yolk. The group then used the paints to create paintings that could be used for testing purposes. Such tests included taking measurements of moisture amounts and movement, oxidation, time to dry and heat capacity.Preparation of an oil paint and a capillary suspension (CapS) paint. Credit: Oph\u00e9lie Ranquet et al., Nature CommunicationsThe researchers found that adding yolk helped to create stronger bonding between pigment particles, which made for stiffer paint. And that, they noted, would have been ideal for use in impasto painting, where the ink is applied thickly to give it a three-dimensional quality. The group also found that adding yolk reduced wrinkling of the paint, helping it to retain the shape applied by the painter\u2014and helped to protect the paint against exposure to high humidity. Antioxidants in the yolk also helped to prevent yellowing.Adding egg yolk also allowed the painter, the team found, to add more pigment to the oil, which in turn, helped to create more vivid images.

  "text": "Enzymes work in the cells of all living organisms, allowing specific and complex reactions to be carried out quite easily. However, few natural enzymes are effective for industrial applications, which could benefit greatly from discoveries that make targeted enzyme creation a reality.          Artificial metalloenzymes can be created simply by binding metal ions or metallic compounds to proteins, so that they exhibit enzymatic activity. Currently, metalloenzymes are being studied to discover new functions or to improve their reactivity when compared to natural enzymes. Nevertheless, the reaction mechanisms of metalloenzymes are still largely unknown, making it very difficult to design artificial enzymes for specific functions or improved efficiency.A research group led by Professor Nobutaka Fujieda, Graduate School of Agriculture, Osaka Metropolitan University, has been creating artificial metalloenzymes using small heat-resistant metal-binding proteins. In their latest study, they describe an artificial metalloenzyme they created simply, making use of the 2-His-1-carboxylate metal-binding motif, which is commonly found naturally in non-heme metalloenzymes. The research results were published in Chemical Science on March 13, 2023.Their new artificial metalloenzyme has a metal-binding site composed of four amino acids, which originally were histidines. The research group mutated these amino acids to create a library of 12 slightly different proteins to compare. After screening the library, they found that the enzyme variant H52A/H58E, when bound with a copper ion, had the best stereoselectivity, so that it reacts selectively with the correct version of the target molecule.The research group then performed X-ray crystallographic analysis of the metal-binding site, confirming two electron densities derived from the copper ions. Furthermore, docking simulations of two copper ions found that the copper, which protruded slightly, could bind to the substrate, leading the group to believe that selectivity was maximized by the movement of the copper ion to where the substrate was most likely to bind.\"Such positional transitions of metal ions have also been observed in natural enzymes, so we believe that detailed analysis of our artificial metalloenzyme's reaction mechanism will deepen what we know about natural enzymes. We hope that the advances of this research will lead to the creation of biocatalysts that can work under mild conditions,\" Professor Fujieda concluded.

  "answer_squad": " Ly<unk> emission line",
  "text": "All biological amino acids on Earth appear exclusively in their left-handed form, but the reason underlying this observation is elusive. Recently, scientists from Japan uncovered new clues about the cosmic origin of this asymmetry. Based on the optical properties of amino acids found on the Murchison meteorite, they conducted physics-based simulations, revealing that the precursors to the biological amino acids may have determined the amino acid chirality during the early phase of galactic evolution.          If you look at your hands, you will notice that they are mirror images of each other. However, no matter how hard you try to flip and rotate one hand, you will never be able to superimpose it perfectly over the other. Many molecules have a similar property called \"chirality,\" which means that the \"left-handed\" (L) version of a molecule cannot be superimposed onto its \"right-handed\" (D) mirror image version. Even though both versions of a chiral molecule, called \"enantiomers,\" have the same chemical formula, the way they interact with other molecules, especially with other chiral molecules, can vary immensely.Interestingly, one of the many mysteries surrounding the origin of life as we know it has to do with chirality. It turns out that biological amino acids (AAs)\u2014the building blocks of proteins\u2014on Earth appear only in one of their two possible enantiomeric forms, namely the L-form. However, if you synthesize AAs artificially, both L and D forms are produced in equal amounts. This suggests that, at some early point in the past, L-AAs must have come to dominate a hetero-chiral world. This phenomenon is known as \"chiral symmetry breaking.\"Against this backdrop, a research team led by Assistant Professor Mitsuo Shoji from University of Tsukuba, Japan, conducted a study aimed at solving this mystery. As explained in their paper published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, the team sought to find evidence supporting the cosmic origin of the homochirality of AAs on Earth, as well as iron out some inconsistencies and contradictions in our previous understanding.\"The idea that homochirality may have originated in space was suggested after AAs were found in the Murchison meteorite that fell in Australia in 1969,\" explains Dr. Shoji. Curiously enough, in the samples obtained from this meteorite, each of the L-enantiomers was more prevalent than its D-enantiomer counterpart. One popular explanation for this suggests that the asymmetry was induced by ultraviolet circularly polarized light (CPL) in the star-forming regions of our galaxy. Scientists verified that this type of radiation can, indeed, induce asymmetric photochemical reactions that, given enough time, would favor the production of L-AAs over D-AAs. However, the absorption properties of the AA isovaline are opposite to those of the other AAs, meaning that the UV-based explanation alone is either insufficient or incorrect.      Against this backdrop, Dr. Shoji's team pursued an alternate hypothesis. Instead of far-UV radiation, they hypothesized that the chiral asymmetry was, in fact, induced specifically by the CP Lyman-\u03b1 (Ly\u03b1) emission line, a spectral line of hydrogen atom that permeated the early Milky Way. Moreover, instead of focusing only on photoreactions in AAs, the researchers investigated the possibility of the chiral asymmetry starting in the precursors to the AAs, namely amino propanals (APs) and amino nitriles (ANs).Through quantum mechanical calculations, the team analyzed Ly\u03b1-induced reactions for producing AAs along the chemical pathway adopted in Strecker synthesis. They then noted the ratios of L- to D-enantiomers of AAs, APs, and ANs at each step of the process.The results showed that L-enantiomers of ANs are preferentially formed under right-handed CP (R-CP) Ly\u03b1 irradiation, with their enantiomeric ratios matching those for the corresponding AAs. \"Taken together, our findings suggest that ANs underlie the origin of the homochirality,\" remarks Dr. Shoji. \"More specifically, irradiating AN precursors with R-CP Ly\u03b1 radiation lead to a higher ratio of L-enantiomers. The subsequent predominance of L-AAs is possible via reactions induced by water molecules and heat.\"The study thus brings us one step closer to understanding the complex history of our own biochemistry. The team emphasizes that more studies focused on ANs need to be conducted on future samples from asteroids and comets to validate their findings. \"Further analyses and theoretical investigations of ANs and other prebiotic molecules related to sugars and nucleobases will provide new insights into the chemical evolution of molecules and, in turn, the origin of life,\" concludes Dr. Shoji.

  "text": "Specialty coffees are gaining traction in coffeehouses around the world\u2014and now a fermented version could bring a fruity taste to your morning cup of joe. This new kind of beverage has a raspberry-like taste and aroma, but what causes these sensations has been a mystery. Today, scientists report six compounds that contribute to the fermented coffee experience. The work could help increase production of the drink and make it more readily available for everyone to enjoy.          The researchers will present their results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.\"There are now flavors that people are creating that no one would have ever associated with coffee in the past,\" says Chahan Yeretzian, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator. \"The flavors in fermented coffee, for example, are often more akin to fruit juices.\"This unusual type of beverage provides a unique flavor experience for consumers, and the growing demand for it means that fermented coffee beans can fetch a high price, potentially benefiting farmers. And the process by which the beans are prepared requires much less water than traditional methods, making it a more environmentally friendly alternative to a standard cup of coffee.But despite this drink's growing popularity, the compounds that cause its distinctive flavor were unknown. And with fermented coffee becoming more popular in competitive events, some people have been concerned that the lack of knowledge about fermented coffee may make it difficult to distinguish between the genuine product and regular joe that has been illicitly adulterated. So, Yeretzian and colleagues from the Coffee Excellence Center at Zurich University of Applied Sciences sought to identify the compounds that are responsible for these new and exciting flavors. And because flavor and smell are intimately linked, studying the beverages' scents could help the team gain a better understanding of how fermented coffee's complex flavor is created.To single out the compounds unique to fermented coffee's aromas, researchers took arabica beans and divided them into three groups. One was prepared using a wash process, which is likely how the average afternoon pick-me-up brew is made. Here, a gelatinous substance known as mucilage is stripped from the coffee bean, which is washed with water before being dried.The researchers prepared the second group using the pulped natural process\u2014another common approach\u2014in which the skin is removed from the bean, but the mucilage is left intact.Finally, the team fermented beans in the third group using carbonic maceration, a process often used in winemaking. This method was first introduced to the specialty coffee world in 2015, when the winning contestant in the World Barista Championship used it to prepare their entry. With this process, whole coffee fruits are fermented in stainless steel tanks and infused with carbon dioxide to lower the pH of the fermentation. Unlike the other brews, the coffee made with fermented beans was described as smelling intense, like raspberries with a hint of rose.      Next, the researchers brewed coffee using each type of bean and analyzed the samples with gas chromatography (GC) sniffing, also called GC olfactometry. First, the GC instrument separated individual components in the air above each sample. Then, as the compounds left the instrument, they went to a mass spectrometer for identification, and to someone sitting at the outlet to describe what they smelled.\"Because the chemical signature doesn't tell us how a compound smells, we have to rely on the human nose to detect the scent as each compound comes out of the chromatography instrument individually,\" says Yeretzian. This methodology can be tricky because there is a subjective element to it. \"We're using people to detect scents, and everybody perceives flavors a little differently,\" says Samo Smrke, Ph.D., a research associate in the lab who is presenting the results. \"But in this case, the panel was very consistent in the smells they described. So, what is traditionally considered a challenge was actually not an issue because the aromas were so clear.\"There is one major advantage to GC sniffing. The human nose can sometimes detect scents from compounds that are at such a low concentration, they're unable to be picked up by mass spectrometry. In this case, although six compounds appeared to contribute to the intense fruity flavor and the raspberry scent of the fermented coffee, the team was only able to identify three of them: 2-methylpropanal, 3-methylbutanal and ethyl 3-methylbutanoate.In the future, the researchers hope to identify the remaining compounds, as well as judge the intensity of different flavors and scents. Additionally, the researchers would like to know more about how these unique compounds form. Potential factors include farming practices, the variety of coffee beans, the microclimate of specific farms and the microbes present during fermentation.\"There's still quite a lot of unknowns surrounding this process,\" says Smrke. A better understanding of the sources of these compounds could help the team standardize production methods, making it easier to produce fermented coffee at larger scales and allowing even more people to enjoy this distinctive flavor.

  "text": "The fruit of the cocklebur plant, which grows worldwide and is often considered a noxious weed, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory components that could make it useful as a skin protectant, according to new research.          Researchers found that compounds in the species' spiky fruits reduced damage from UVB exposure and sped wound healing in laboratory tests using cells and tissues. The cocklebur extracts also appear to influence the production of collagen, a protein that gives skin its elasticity and prevents wrinkles.\"We found that cocklebur fruit has the potential to protect the skin and help enhance production of collagen,\" said Eunsu Song, a doctoral candidate at Myongji University in South Korea, who conducted the research with Myongji University Professsor Jinah Hwang. \"In this regard, it could be an attractive ingredient for creams or other cosmetic forms. It will likely show a synergistic effect if it is mixed with other effective compounds, such as hyaluronic acid or retinoic acid, against aging.\"Song will present the new research at Discover BMB, the annual meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, March 25\u201328 in Seattle.Cocklebur is a plant native to Southern Europe, Central Asia and China that has spread worldwide, often found in moist or sandy areas such as roadside ditches and riverbanks. Its distinctive fruits, covered in stiff husks and burrs, have been used for centuries in traditional medicines for headache, stuffy nose, disorders of skin pigmentation, tuberculosis-related illness and rheumatoid arthritis. In recent years scientists have explored its potential use in treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.The new study is the first to examine the fruit's properties as a wound-healing agent and skin protectant. Researchers first studied the molecular properties of cocklebur fruit extracts and isolated particular compounds that could contribute to anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. They then used cell cultures and a 3D tissue model with properties similar to human skin to study how these compounds affect collagen production, wound healing and damage from UVB radiation.The results showed that the cocklebur fruit extracts encouraged collagen production, sped wound healing and exerted a protective effect against UVB radiation. Comparing the bioactivity of cocklebur fruits grown in different places, the researchers found that fruits grown in South Korea had slightly higher anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and greater wound-healing activity than those grown in China.Researchers cautioned that high doses of cocklebur fruit extract can be harmful and further research is needed to determine how to use it safely in cosmetic or pharmaceutical applications.\"In its burrs, cocklebur fruit also has a toxic constituent, carboxyatractyloside, which can damage the liver,\" said Song. \"Cocklebur showed a potential as a cosmetic agent by increasing collagen synthesis; however, it showed negative results with higher concentrations. Therefore, finding the proper concentration seems very important and would be key to commercializing cocklebur fruit extracts in cosmetics.\"Moving forward, the researchers plan to further study the biological mechanisms involved and conduct experiments in animal alternatives to explore ways to safely adapt cocklebur fruit extracts for use in cosmetic products.

Even though this drug has been available commercially since the late 1800s, scientists have not yet fully elucidated its detailed mechanism of action and cellular targets. The new findings could pave the way to safer aspirin alternatives and might also have implications for improving cancer immunotherapies.

It is used to treat pain, fever and inflammation, and an estimated 29 million people in the U.S. take it daily to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.Scientists know that aspirin inhibits the cyclooxygenase enzyme, or COX, which creates messenger molecules that are crucial in the inflammatory response.

Avisankar Chini also made significant contributions to the study.\"Aspirin is a magic drug, but long-term use of it can cause detrimental side effects such as internal bleeding and organ damage,\" Mandal said. \"It's important that we understand how it works so we can develop safer drugs with fewer side effects.\"The team found that aspirin controls transcription factors required for cytokine expression during inflammation while also influencing many other inflammatory proteins and noncoding RNAs that are critically linked to inflammation and immune response. Mandal said this work has required a unique interdisciplinary team with expertise in inflammation signaling biology and organic chemistry.They also showed that aspirin slows the breakdown of the amino acid tryptophan into its metabolite kynurenine by inhibiting associated enzymes called indoleamine dioxygenases, or IDOs. Tryptophan metabolism plays a central role in the inflammation and immune response.\"We found that aspirin downregulates IDO1 expression and associated kynurenine production during inflammation,\" Mandal said. \"Since aspirin is a COX inhibitor, this suggests potential interplay between COX and IDO1 during inflammation.\"IDO1 is an important target for immunotherapy, a type of cancer treatment that helps the body's immune system seek out and destroy cancer cells. Because COX inhibitors modulate the COX\u2013IDO1 axis during inflammation, the researchers predict that COX inhibitors might also be useful as drugs for immunotherapy.Mandal and his team are now creating a series of small molecules that modulate COX\u2013IDO1 and will explore their potential use as anti-inflammatory drugs and immunotherapeutic agents.

  "text": "Bioactive compounds present mostly in fruit and vegetables perform different bodily functions relating to health and well-being. Their effects are considered antioxidant, antidiabetic, antiaging and anticancer, among others.          Many studies are looking for ways to optimize absorption of bioactive compounds by the organism and increase their bioavailability\u2014the proportion that enters the bloodstream after absorption. One way is to coat the compounds with another material and package them on the nanometric scale (a nanometer is a billionth of a meter). Nanoencapsulation, as this technique is known, assures slow release of the compounds so that they take longer to digest and can survive the attacks of bacteria in the gut microbiome.An investigation conducted by a duo of researchers at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCF-USP) in Brazil is one of these studies. Working at the school's Department of Food Science and Experimental Nutrition, they have produced several articles on the subject\u2014the latest of which, published in the International Journal of Biological Macromolecules, is a review of the literature on pectin-based nanoencapsulation plus a description of a novel technology developed under the aegis of the Food Research Center (FoRC), a Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center (RIDC).\"We used pectin extracted from residues of citrus fruit albedo and peel, with a degree of purity permitting human ingestion and excluding any kind of hazardous chemical,\" said Jo\u00e3o Paulo Fabi, one of the authors and a professor at FCF-USP. Albedo is the layer of white spongy material inside the peels of oranges and lemons, for example.\"In addition to our review of the literature, we describe a novel technology for nanoencapsulation of bioactive compounds using pectin. This entails producing a pectin-lysozyme complex as a protective outer layer for a highly sensitive bioactive compound called anthocyanin,\" he explained, adding that lysozyme is \"a safely edible substance obtained from egg white and used to enhance the stability of the end-product.\"Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments belonging to the flavonoid family. They are phenolic compounds found in all plants and responsible for the shades of red, blue and purple seen in flowers, fruit, leaves, stalks and roots.The authors say their methodology can be used to encapsulate other water-soluble bioactive compounds. \"We tested anthocyanin because of its challenging sensitivity to many factors, such as light, temperature, pH and gut bacteria,\" said Thi\u00e9cla Katiane Osvaldt Rosales, the other author. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Nuclear and Energy Research Institute (IPEN).      Advantages of methodologyAccording to the researchers, the main advantage of their methodology is that no other compounds are added apart from pectin, lysozyme and anthocyanin. \"We used three compounds from sources in nature and mixed them in the laboratory to form a new product, without adding salts, ligands or anything potentially toxic. Furthermore, the nanoparticles are not too small. Very tiny nanoparticles can penetrate barriers and cell membranes, entering the DNA and having toxic effects. The size we obtained is safe,\" Fabi said.Rosales outlined the process they developed to produce the nanoparticles. \"Pectin and lysozyme are heated separately. The increase in temperature partly alters their structure, and they interact better when heated. They are then rapidly cooled to reach a temperature not harmful to anthocyanin, which is sensitive and fairly unstable. The three substances are blended in an aqueous suspension and agitated for an hour. The result is encapsulated anthocyanin. The suspension is then filtered to separate the non-encapsulated contents,\" she said.Special care is taken with factors such as temperature and pH. \"We tested the parameters for the purpose of optimization, especially pH. If pH is too high, the anthocyanin breaks down. It can't be too low, either. We found a pH of 5 to be optimal for interaction between the molecules,\" she explained. \"We also tested the duration and intensity of the agitation. We made a point of managing all the details, however minor, because they make a difference in terms of forming stable particles. We've applied for a patent on the methodology.\"ResultsFinally, the encapsulation was tested for efficacy in a digestion system simulated in the laboratory to mimic the gastric and intestinal phases. \"The result was that part of the anthocyanin was released during the digestive process, at the end of gastric digestion, and part remained in the nanostructure, with the possibility of release of this remainder in the gut or absorption together with the nanostructure. We believe this was a good outcome. Partial and gradual release suggests absorption of the compound starts before it enters the gut, with the nanoencapsulated remainder probably being released in the gut or fully absorbed with less structural alteration,\" Rosales said.The next step will be animal testing. \"We tested the method in vitro and obtained results indicating that the nanoparticles are safe for consumption. We have evidence that cells can absorb them in a non-toxic manner and that the pectin protects the anthocyanin and its properties. We now have to test it in animals, observing the process of oral ingestion, absorption of the anthocyanin using specific markers for absorption, and the route followed in the organism. It's important to verify the extent of absorption and the biological destination,\" she said.The nanoparticles are mainly intended for use as a food supplement. \"They can be added to food and dietary supplements, but industrial mass production would be necessary to include them in a supplement,\" Fabi said.It is worth noting that the method does not require expensive equipment or procedures. \"In addition, the material used for the nanocapsules, which comes from byproducts of citrus peel, would make the cost even lower for manufacturers. The pectin we used in our study is available commercially and is used by the food industry, mostly for gel formation in jam or as a thickener,\" Rosales said.

  "answer_squad": " absorb the moisture generated in it",
  "text": "Pads incorporated into fresh meat packaging, whose function is to absorb the moisture generated in it, and that can cause food spoilage, are generally composed of plastic polymers derived from petroleum by-products.          In today's world, in which European and national regulations and international agreements call for a future in which plastics are avoided, to avert their negative effects on human health and the environment, the Biopren research group in the Chemical Engineering Area of the University of Cordoba has developed natural-waste padding that not only absorbs moisture, like conventional pads do, but also delays the oxidation of the meat.This innovation, which is still in the concept development phase, uses organic waste, thus favoring the efficient use of resources and bolstering the Circular Economy.To this end, the pads developed, whose shape is similar to that of make-up removers, and are called aerogels, are composed of three basic elements. First, the base is made of chitosan, a polymer derived from crustacean shells. Compared to the plastic polymers used in commercial pads, the study uses a natural one. Chitosan, however, does have some disadvantages, including its irregular structure, and the fact that it is more soluble in water, and is weaker.                The researchers Luis Serrano and Esther Rinc\u00f3n with the pads developed. Credit: University of Cordoba             To counteract this, the research team added the other two elements: nanocellulose from laurel pruning -one of the most widely grown aromatic and medicinal plant crops in the Mediterranean area- and bay leaf essential oil, which make the pad stiffer and more durable, and delay oxidation of the meat.With these three elements, explains Esther Rinc\u00f3n of the research group, \"what we have managed to do is to keep the meat in a fresh state, like at the beginning, after ten days of refrigerated storage.\"The study, which has been published on the cover of the journal Polymers, is a first step, a proof of concept. Future studies will need to focus on the safety and healthiness of the pads to verify, for example, that no components seep into the meat that might produce allergic reactions.

  "answer_squad": " C3N4",
  "text": "H2O2 is not only a green oxidant that is widely used in environmental remediation, industrial synthesis, and medical healthcare, etc., but also an emerging energy carrier with a high energy density comparable to compressed H2.          At present, anthraquinone oxidation is still the primary route for large-scale H2O2 production, which requires a high energy input and creates a lot of harmful pollutants. As an alternative, photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and O2 has been considered as a green, safe, and energy-saving strategy for sustainable H2O2 production, and has attracted growing interest over the past years.However, the photocatalytic efficiency is still far from meeting the practical requirements. The exploration of efficient semiconductor photocatalysts with superior optoelectronic properties is the key to achieving desirable photocatalytic performance.Among many candidates, carbon nitride (C3N4) has been the main research focus for photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. Specially, the heptazine units in C3N4 play a critical role of active sites to facilitate the selective oxygen reduction.Moreover, the metal-free nature of C3N4 could also protect the generated H2O2 from fast decomposition caused by transition-metal sites like in inorganic semiconductors. However, C3N4 photocatalysts usually suffer from narrow light absorption and fast charge recombination due to insufficient conjugation, leading to unsatisfactory photocatalytic performance.On the basis of the understanding of the inherent merits and pitfalls of C3N4, Prof. Yanguang Li from Soochow University, China and his coworkers proposed a new photocatalyst design strategy that integrating the active heptazine units and functional linkers into crystalline conjugated polymer frameworks.The highly conjugated molecular structure could improve the electron delocalization thorough the organic skeletons and increase the light absorption; furthermore, the ordered interlayer \u03c0-\u03c0 would provide high-speed channels for charge transfer, thereby decreasing their recombination.By comparison with the pristine C3N4, the resultant sample (denoted as COF-TpHt) exhibits a broader light absorption up to 800 nm and much improved charge separation efficiency as demonstrated by a series of spectroscopic measurements. Under the visible-light irradiation, COF-TpHt exhibits a high H2O2 production rate of 11986 \u03bcmol h\u20131 g\u20131 and an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) up to 38% at 420 nm, both of which are superior to other reported organic and inorganic counterparts.Impressively, COF-TpHt shows excellent stability that enables almost linear H2O2 accumulation during a long time irradiation, giving rise to a H2O2 concentration of over 59 mM after 30 h. This research has been published in Chinese Journal of Catalysis.

  "answer_squad": " neural networks",
  "text": "A team of researchers from the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, the University of Vienna, and Sirius University of Science and Technology has published a study in the Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design that presents guidelines for enhancing the drug discovery process by utilizing multitask learning techniques.          In universities, students often take related courses, such as physics and mathematics, which leads to a better understanding of both subjects. Similarly, learning a new language is easier for those who have already had experience with languages, particularly cognate ones. The same principle applies to machine learning, where a neural network can better comprehend multiple \"subjects\" if it learns them simultaneously. Considering that neural networks are one of the best approaches for predicting the biological properties of new chemical compounds, the question arises: How can we assist a neural network in simultaneously learning and predicting the properties of chemical compounds in relation to multiple biological targets?Researchers analyzed three datasets for this purpose: a dataset with information on the antiviral activity of molecules and two datasets with information on the impact of molecules on various proteins in our body. The datasets varied in the completeness of information on each protein or virus. During the study, scientists discovered that adding data to the dataset is an effective method for improving prediction accuracy. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the more informative the original dataset is, the more noticeable this improvement. As a result of this work, the research team prepared a set of recommendations for using data enrichment technology to improve the quality and stability of predictions, as well as methods for objectively evaluating the improvement achieved.\"Multitask learning is widely used in many scientific fields. Unsurprisingly, it is increasingly being applied to develop new drugs. However, the potential of this approach has not yet been fully explored, presenting us with numerous unresolved tasks,\" the lead author of the study, Skoltech Ph.D. candidate Ekaterina Sosnina, notes. \"We were inspired by the possibility of using multitask learning to develop new drug candidates and searched for ways to improve this approach.

An Australian company on Tuesday lifted the glass cloche on a meatball made of lab-grown cultured meat using the genetic sequence from the long-extinct pachyderm, saying it was meant to fire up public debate about the hi-tech treat.          The launch in an Amsterdam science museum came just days before April 1 so there was an elephant in the room: Is this for real?\"This is not an April Fools joke,\" said Tim Noakesmith, founder of Australian startup Vow. \"This is a real innovation.\"Cultivated meat\u2014also called cultured or cell-based meat\u2014is made from animal cells. Livestock doesn't need to be killed to produce it, which advocates say is better not just for the animals but also for the environment.Vow used publicly available genetic information from the mammoth, filled missing parts with genetic data from its closest living relative, the African elephant, and inserted it into a sheep cell, Noakesmith said. Given the right conditions in a lab, the cells multiplied until there were enough to roll up into the meatball.More than 100 companies around the world are working on cultivated meat products, many of them startups like Vow.Experts say that if the technology is widely adopted, it could vastly reduce the environmental impact of global meat production in the future. Currently, billions of acres of land are used for agriculture worldwide.                A meatball made using genetic code from the mammoth is seen at the Nemo science museum in Amsterdam, Tuesday March 28, 2023.

So far, tiny Singapore is the only country to have approved cell-based meat for consumption. Vow is hoping to sell its first product there\u2014a cultivated Japanese quail meat\u2014later this year.The mammoth meatball is a one-off and has not been tasted, even by its creators, nor is it planned to be put into commercial production. Instead, it was presented as a source of protein that would get people talking about the future of meat.\"We wanted to get people excited about the future of food being different to potentially what we had before. That there are things that are unique and better than the meats that we're necessarily eating now, and we thought the mammoth would be a conversation starter and get people excited about this new future,\" Noakesmith told The Associated Press.\"But also the woolly mammoth has been traditionally a symbol of loss. We know now that it died from climate change. And so what we wanted to do was see if we could create something that was a symbol of a more exciting future that's not only better for us, but also better for the planet,\" he added.      Seren Kell, science and technology manager at Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that promotes plant- and cell-based alternatives to animal products, said he hopes the project \"will open up new conversations about cultivated meat's extraordinary potential to produce more sustainable foods, reduce the climate impact of our existing food system and free up land for less intensive farming practices.\"He said the mammoth project with its unconventional gene source was an outlier in the new meat cultivation sector, which commonly focuses on traditional livestock\u2014cattle, pigs and poultry.

  "text": "The discovery of a small molecule in the research lab of Bradley McConnell, professor of pharmacology at the University of Houston College of Pharmacy, may well be the genesis of new medication which could shorten the course of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Unlike Pfizer's antiviral treatment Paxlovid, which is only useful during the first three days of showing symptoms, this possible new medication could reduce the course of the virus upon exposure.          \"Neutralizing small molecules may provide immediate protection against viral infection, and thus be suitable for people of all ages, and may be particularly suitable for high-risk populations and immunocompromised individuals who typically do not generate sufficient antibodies after vaccination,\" said McConnell in Biomedicines. \"This exciting new small molecule drug candidate has the potential to be developed into an alternative drug treatment for COVID-19.\"The molecule's discovery began during the height of the pandemic when students in the McConnell lab were working from home and an idea hatched that perhaps a tiny molecule could impact the virus. The team screened 1,509,984 feature-rich compounds in the UH Research Computing Data Core, home of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Data Science Institute.The team searched for a molecule that could interrupt the interaction between the spike protein, located on the outside of the coronavirus, and its human target to enter into human cells, the ACE2 protein.\"Our team is thrilled with the discovery of a small molecule therapeutic that inhibits the interaction between the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus and the ACE2 receptor of the infected individual,\" said McConnell. \"We are grateful that the University had the high-performance computing power available on campus to advance our work so effectively. This is a discovery that could ultimately impact many lives.\"McConnell's team includes Arfaxad Reyes-Alcaraz, Hanan Qasim, Elizabeth Merlinsky, Tasneem Islam, and Bryan Medina from the UH College of Pharmacy; Robert J. Schwartz, John W. Craft, Jr. from the UH Department of Biology and Biochemistry; and Glenn Fox, Rogers State University in Oklahoma.During the experimentation phase, the team selected the top 15 molecules that disrupted the interaction between the spike protein and the ACE2 receptor. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed that some of the compounds from these libraries had favorable interactions with the spike protein's ACE receptor binding domain interface, leading to a potential neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and one particular molecule rose to the top: CD04872SC, which formed the closest association.\"We were able to experimentally observe that CD04872SC also inhibited the infection of the SARS-CoV-2 variants delta and omicron,\" said Reyes-Alcaraz, the study's first author.\"To demonstrate the binding between CD04872SC and the spike proteins of each variant, we performed a thermal shift assay which measures changes in the thermal denaturation temperature, serving as an indicator of the stability of a protein under varying conditions such as when bound by a drug, pH, ionic strength, or sequence mutation,\" said Craft, associate professor in the Department of Biology and Biochemistry.It's a medical discovery whose time has come.The SARS-CoV-2 virus and variants delta and omicron are still a major threat to patients of all ages. The variants demonstrate how easily the virus can accommodate antigenic changes in its spike protein without the loss of fitness.\"The omicron variant has particularly stressed health care systems around the world. Therefore, identifying effective antiviral agents to combat this infectious disease is urgently needed,\" said McConnell.For the future, McConnell suggests further development of molecule derivatives and preclinical trials.\"This promising drug candidate lead should be developed into a family of derivatives that could be further refined, possibly leading to a more efficacious and cost-effective alternative to expensive neutralizing treatments,\" said McConnell.

  "text": "A team of chemical and biomolecular engineers at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has developed a scalable way to use bacteria to convert CO2 in the air into a polyester. In their paper, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the group describes their technique and outline its performance when tested over a several-hour period.          As climate change progresses, scientists around the world continue to look for ways to both prevent emissions and to scrub emissions from the air. In this new effort, the researchers took another look at the possibility of using Cupriavidus necator, a type of bacteria, to pull CO2 from the air and then to use it to make a type of polyester.Prior research has shown that C. necator can pull in CO2 and use it to make certain types of biodegradable plastics. But the process can only be done in batches because of the need for electricity to start the process\u2014toxic byproducts build up and kill the bacteria. This prevents the process from scaling. In this new effort, the research team in Korea overcame this problem.The workaround involved adding a synthetic membrane at the start of the process that separates the bacteria from the toxic byproducts. This led to a two-sided process. On one side, chemical reactions prepared CO2 for fermentation, while the other side held other needed ingredients. The membrane then allowed the ingredients to flow slowly to the side with the bacteria, which used them to make bits of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate.The research team ran the process, which involved periodically removing bacteria holding onto the PHB and adding fresh empty samples, for 18 days. They found it worked as planned and also made 11.5 mg of PHB per hour. The researchers note that the process does still require electricity but because it is so much more efficient than other methods, the cost of converting CO2 to a polyester was much cheaper. They also note that the process can be easily scaled up.

Though it has been challenging to distinguish between living M1 and M2 using fluorescent molecules until now, a research team at POSTECH has developed a novel probe, selectively dyeing M2 over M1 for the first time.The work of the team, including Professor Young-Tae Chang (Department of Chemistry), Professor Nam-Young Kang (Department of Convergence IT Engineering), Professor Haw-Young Kwon, Heewon Cho and Sun Hyeok Lee from the Department of Interdisciplinary Bioscience & Bioengineering at POSTECH, has developed the first M2 selective probe CDg18 with a novel mechanism. The research findings were recently published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.Fluorescent probes are chemical compounds that are able to emit light upon recognition of specific ions or materials. The discrimination of living human cells is of importance, not only in clinical diagnosis but the pursuit of effective treatment strategies for infections or inflammatory conditions.Macrophages are specialized immune cells, exhibiting remarkable plasticity in response to environmental stimuli. The activated macrophages broadly categorize into two different subsets, M1 and M2. M1 macrophages have aggressive functions against invaders such as bacteria and tumors while M2 macrophages are anti-inflammatory cells, which promote tumor immunity.Tumor-associated macrophages represent a critical determinant to form tumor microenvironment, which is a typical example of M2 cells. Despite the evident importance of M2 macrophages, real-time monitoring of M2 had remained a challenge.The team developed a novel M2 probe, CDg18, by employing a unique mechanism of Gating-Oriented Live-cell Distinction (GOLD) through the specific overexpressed fatty acid transporter in M2. To demonstrate the potential of CDg18, the team visualized the phenotypic shift of M2 toward M1 using a resveratrol analog HS-1973 as a reprogramming effector.The simultaneous use of both CDg18 and the M1 probe, CDr17, facilitated dual-color monitoring macrophage reprogramming in real time that was defined by the diminishing M2 character and emergence of M1 markers.Professor Young-Tae Chang who led the team explained, \"The M2 probe (and the M1 probe previously developed) developed by the team in this research enables the monitoring of M1 and M2 distribution in cancerous tissues as well as their changes over time.\" He added, \"This represents a novel technological approach in addressing the existing limitations in this field.\" More information:Heewon Cho et al, Development of a Fluorescent Probe for M2 Macrophages via Gating-Oriented Live-Cell Distinction, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2023).

  "text": "From fiber optic cables to smartphones, glass is playing a major role in emerging technology. To learn more about how glass will shape future society, we spoke with Katelyn Kirchner, a doctoral candidate at Penn State, who is studying with John Mauro, Penn State's Dorothy Pate Enright Professor of Materials Science and Engineering. Kirchner is lead author and Mauro corresponding author on a recent review article on the unique properties of glass published in the journal Chemical Reviews.          The article, which was published in print last month and co-authored with an international team of scientists, is the first comprehensive look at the spatial and temporal fluctuations of glass. It is a review of experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches to characterize and demonstrate the effects of various types of fluctuations on physical properties and processes, focusing primarily on commercially relevant oxide glasses.Let's start with the basics. What is glass?That's a wonderfully complicated question. The exact definition is something that is still being explored today. A glass is a non-equilibrium, non-crystalline state of matter that appears solid on a short time scale but continuously relaxes towards the liquid state. Let's break that down a bit further. Glass is a nonequilibrium material, which means the atomic structure is not in it's lowest energy, equilibrium configuration, which would be a liquid or crystal state. Consequently, all glasses have two options: to continuously relax toward the equilibrium liquid state or undergo a phase transition into the crystal state.This relaxation to the liquid state is so slow that from the human observation time, glasses appear solid. Glass being non-crystalline means the atomic structure lacks a long-range pattern, which adds additional complications when trying to predict how the atoms will arrange. And there are many other scientific \"non\" words we could include to more accurately define \"what is glass?\" We understand glass by what it is not, but we do not yet fully understand what glass is. This complication makes it thrilling to be in the field of glass science, as there is so much left to explore.Despite our lack of understanding of it, what are some of the ways the unique qualities of glass are being deployed in society today?Think about all the ways we interact with glass in our daily lives, in areas like information technology, where glass is fundamental to displays, augmented reality, memory storage, and optical data transfer. Then there are areas like transportation and architecture, with vehicles and construction materials, or the energy sector with photovoltaics and next-generation batteries. You can even look to health care with pharmaceutical packaging, antimicrobial surfaces, and prescription lenses. The impact of glass on our world has been tremendous.      What are you currently working on?Right now, I'm doing mostly experimental work trying to visualize the fluctuations in glass. By \"fluctuations\" I mean spatial fluctuations, how the properties vary in different regions of the glass, and I also mean temporal fluctuations, how the material changes over time.One of the most fascinating things about glass is that these fluctuations (i.e., deviations) in the atomic structure directly impact the macroscopic properties. When I come back to Penn State from my research fellowship at Hokkaido University to complete my Ph.D. with Dr. Mauro, I will be working with the data I'm collecting now to develop a computational framework to better understanding how fluctuations in thin film glasses could be manipulated to achieve new-found property behaviors.What would be some of the potential applications for what you're discovering?Fiber optics is a good one, because if we understand fluctuations in glass, we can better understand, predict, and optimize how an optical signal moves through a cable. When you consider the long distances these signals travel, we're talking about transoceanic communication, every small fluctuation has a big impact.Each time the light signal hits the silica walls of the cable, the local properties of the glass are going to influence how that signal propagates through the rest of fiber, which impacts the quality of the signal transfer and overall cost of the infrastructure. A deep understanding of how the impact of fluctuations in glass has major potential to improve fiber optic technology, and this is just one example of a potential application.What about the future? What new, future technology do you think will be facilitated by glass?That's the great part of this work. The possibilities are endless when we look toward applications of tomorrow for glass, such for the development and commercialization of non-lithium ion batteries, improved electronic memory storage devices, improved sustainable energy production, augmented reality interfaces, etc.The purpose of materials research is to better understand the fundamental sciences so we can develop the next groundbreaking technologies, and I have no doubt glass will play an integral role in that future.I remember as a kid my uncle, who was a metallurgist, showing me the images of the Hubble Space Telescope. He explained the engineering of the various materials used to facilitate the visualization of distant galaxies. Glass has allowed us to see beyond our own galaxy and explore the universe. It's thrilling to think about all the future discoveries that will be made thanks to glass. More information:Katelyn A.

  "question_squad": " What is the most commonly used technique for removing plastics from water?",
  "answer_squad": " Filtration",
  "text": "Colorful particles of plastic drift along under the surface of most waterways, from headwater streams to the Arctic Ocean. These barely visible microplastics\u2014less than 5 mm wide\u2014are potentially harmful to aquatic animals and plants, as well as humans. So, researchers are devising ways to remove them and to stop them at their source. Today, a team reports a two-stage device made with steel tubes and pulsing sound waves that removes most of the plastic particles from real water samples.          The researchers will present their results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.\"The idea came from a discussion with a colleague who said that we need new ways to collect microplastics from water,\" says Menake Piyasena, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator. \"Because acoustic forces can push particles together, I wondered if we could use them to aggregate microplastics in water, making the plastic easier to remove.\"Filtration is the most commonly used technique for removing these materials from water. For example, washing machine outlet filters can keep fibers that slough off clothes during washing from entering wastewater. But this method can be costly on a large scale, requiring regular cleaning of the filters, which can get clogged.Another option could be concentrating plastic particles in flowing water with acoustic forces, or sound waves, that transfer energy to nearby particles, causing some of them to vibrate and move. Just think of a speaker playing loud music that shakes the ground, bouncing flecks of dust and dirt toward each other. Scientists have already been using this phenomenon to separate biological particles from liquids, such as red blood cells from plasma.Recently, some teams have applied this approach to the separation of microplastics from samples they prepared in the lab with pure water. But this work was done with tiny volumes of water. They also used microplastics that were only tens of microns wide\u2014smaller than the width of human hair, explains Nelum Perera, a graduate student in Piyasena's lab at New Mexico Tech.\"I read that most of the microplastics in the environment are larger than that,\" says Perera, who is presenting the work. \"So, I wanted to develop a device that could be useful for most of the sizes and could be scaled up to meet real-world goals.\"To accommodate higher water flow rates, Perera created a proof-of-concept device with 8-mm-wide steel tubes connected to one inlet tube and multiple outlet tubes. Then she attached a transducer to the metal tube's side. When the transducer was turned on, it generated ultrasound waves across the metal tube, applying acoustic forces onto microplastics as they passed through the system, making them easier to capture. The prototype device is relatively simple compared to traditional filtration methods, Piyasena explains, because it doesn't clog as easily as a filter.      In initial experiments with polystyrene, polyethylene and polymethyl methacrylate microplastics, the researchers discovered that smaller (6- to 180-\u00b5m-wide) particles behaved differently than the larger (180- to 300-\u00b5m-wide) ones in the presence of acoustic forces. Spiked into pure water, particles of both sizes arranged along the center of the channel, exiting through the middle outlet, while clean water flowed out the surrounding outlets. But if laundry detergent or fabric softener were added to the water, the larger particles focused toward the sides, exiting through the side outlets, and purified water out the middle outlet.Based on these results, the researchers set out to develop a system that could take advantage of these differing movements. They connected two steel tubes in tandem: The first stage captured small microplastics less than 180 \u00b5m wide, and the water stream with the remaining larger microplastics went to the second stage to be cleaned. \"We removed more than 70% of the small plastics and more than 82% of the large ones this way,\" says Perera.To show that the two-stage system could work for real-world applications, Perera and Piyasena collected water from a pond on the New Mexico Tech campus and from the Rio Grande River. They filtered all of the samples to remove large contaminants, leaving behind water that still contained dissolved substances that could have affected the separation. Next, they spiked the water with microplastics. When the environmental water samples went through the acoustics device, plastic particles were removed as effectively as from pure water. With this prototype, Perera estimates it would cost around 7 cents to operate the current device for an hour and take around an hour and a half to clean one liter of water.The team's next step is to develop a system with wider tubes, or bundles of multiple tubes, and to try it on unspiked real-world samples, including ocean water and wastewater from washing machines. \"We have shown that acoustic forces can be used to concentrate a wide range of microplastic sizes,\" says Piyasena. \"And from here, we want to prove that this can be done on a larger scale with real samples that already have microplastics in them.\" More information:ACS Spring 2023: Removal of environmentally relevant microplastics using acoustic forces and steel tubes, www.acs.org/meetings/acs-meetings/spring-2023.htmlProvided byAmerican Chemical SocietyCitation:Pulsing ultrasound waves could someday remove microplastics from waterways (2023, March 28)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-03-pulsing-ultrasound-microplastics-waterways.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " origami",
  "text": "The ancient art of origami is well known for transforming sheets of paper and other foldable materials into complex 3D shapes. But now, chemical engineers have extended the centuries-old practice to produce intricate shapes made of glass or other hard materials. Their thoroughly modern method, which can be combined with 3D printing, could have applications ranging from sculpture to catalysis and beyond.          The researchers will present their results today at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330, and features more than 10,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.In earlier work, the researchers used origami and the related technique of kirigami\u2014which combines cutting with folding\u2014to shape soft materials made of polymers. \"But we wanted to extend these techniques to glass and ceramics, which are much harder to process into complex shapes than polymers,\" says Tao Xie, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator.Typically, glass and ceramics are shaped in a mold or are 3D printed in the desired final structure. But a mold can't produce a complicated shape, Xie says. And although 3D printing can do so, it's slow, and an object can be flimsy and need extra support while it's being made. In addition, the printed item usually has a layered texture that might not be the ideal appearance. The team set out to see if they could overcome these shortcomings.Yang Xu, a graduate student who works in Xie's lab at Zhejiang University, devised a technique in which she mixed nanoparticles of silica\u2014the main ingredient for making glass\u2014into a liquid containing several compounds. Curing the mixture with ultraviolet light produced a cross-linked polycaprolactone polymer with tiny beads of silica suspended in it, like raisins in raisin bread.Next, Xu cut, folded, twisted and pulled on sheets of this translucent polymer composite, which has mechanical properties similar to paper, to make a crane, a feather, a lacy vase and a sphere made of intertwined ribbons, among other objects. If she did this at room temperature, the composite retained its new shape fairly well throughout the remaining production steps. Xu discovered that's because the folding and stretching process irreversibly disrupts the interface between some of the silica particles and the polymer matrix. But if it's critical to fully retain the new shape during the subsequent steps, Xu found that the composite must be heated at about 265 F when it is folded and stretched. That permanently rearranges the links between the polymer chains, firmly fixing the new shape in place.      A subsequent heating step at more than 1,100 F removes the polycaprolactone polymer from the object and turns it opaque. After cooling, a third heating step, known as sintering, melts the silica particles together at temperatures topping 2,300 F to convert the object into clear glass with a smooth, non-layered texture. Achieving that full transparency turned out to be the project's biggest challenge. Including more polymer in the mix made the objects easier to fold but reduced their final transparency, explains Xu, who is presenting the work at the meeting. She ultimately found the right concentrations of polymer and silica to successfully compromise between those competing priorities.In her latest work, Xu is extending the method beyond glass to ceramics, replacing the silica with substances such as zirconium dioxide and titanium dioxide. Whereas glass is brittle and inert, these compounds open up the possibility of producing \"functional\" objects, such as materials that are less fragile than glass or that have catalytic properties.The group is also experimenting with a combination of kirigami and 3D printing to make even more complex shapes. \"When you fold a piece of paper, the level of complexity is somewhat limited, and 3D printing is kind of slow,\" Xie says. \"So we wanted to see if we could combine these two techniques to take advantage of their attractive attributes. That would give us the freedom to make almost any shaped part.\"In the catalyst field, Xie notes, people use 3D printing to make ceramic structures perforated with microscopic channels, which increase a catalyst's exposed surface area. Xu's method could enable more intricate designs for such applications, and as a test case, she has printed a pierced 3D lattice made of the silica-polymer composite (red structure in accompanying image).Xu notes that her process could be automated for large-scale manufacturing. She and Xie hope the ceramics and artistic communities will learn about the work and apply it in catalyst and sculpture design, as well as other purposes the researchers haven't even thought of yet.

  "text": "Have a cough, sore throat and congestion? Any number of respiratory viruses could be responsible. Conventional tests can identify certain likely culprits by relying on chemical reactions, but some researchers want to swap chemistry for electrical changes sensed by nanomaterials. Today, scientists report using a single-atom-thick nanomaterial to build a device that can simultaneously detect the presence of the viruses that cause COVID-19 and the flu\u2014at much lower levels and much more quickly than conventional tests for either.          The researchers will present their results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.The symptoms of both flu and COVID-19 overlap considerably, making it difficult to distinguish between them, notes Deji Akinwande, Ph.D., who is presenting the work at the meeting.\"When both of these viruses are circulating together as they did earlier this winter, it would be immensely useful to have a sensor that can simultaneously detect whether you have COVID, flu, none of the above or both,\" he says.Akinwande, who is at The University of Texas at Austin, says that the device he and colleagues are developing could be modified to test for other infections as well.The group, including Dmitry Kireev, Ph.D., a postdoc in Akinwande's lab, constructed the COVID-19 and flu sensor using graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice pattern. Its extreme thinness renders graphene highly sensitive to any electrical changes in its environment. Akinwande and other researchers see enormous potential in using it and other, similar nanomaterials to create sensors for many different applications.\"These ultra-thin nanomaterials generally hold the record for best sensitivity, even down to the detection of single atoms, and they can improve the ability to detect very small quantities of basically anything that needs to be sensed, whether it's bacteria or viruses, in gas or in blood,\" Akinwande says.Previously, his group reported designing a graphene-based temporary tattoo that could monitor blood pressure. The tattoo consists of pairs of sensors placed along the arteries of the arm. One half of each pair sends out an electrical current that its partner detects. This signal is used to determine blood flow.To build the infection sensor, the researchers had to make graphene respond to the presence of viral protein. To do so, they looked to the immune system, which produces antibodies that are fine-tuned to recognize and latch onto particular pathogens. The researchers linked antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and against the flu virus to graphene. When a sample from an infected person is placed on the sensor, these antibodies bind to their target proteins, prompting a change in the electrical current.The researchers did not have the safety facilities needed to use whole, active flu or SARS-CoV-2 viruses to test the roughly square-inch sensor. To substitute, they used proteins from these viruses delivered in fluid intended to resemble saliva. Their results indicated that not only could the sensor detect the presence of the proteins, it could do so when they were present at extremely low quantities. This sensitivity suggested the sensor could be used for detecting the much more sparse viral particles found in breath, Akinwande says.The sensor also worked quickly, returning results within about 10 seconds of dropping in a sample, he says. By comparison, conventional COVID-19 tests can take minutes or hours, depending on the type, and a dual COVID and flu test recently authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration takes about half an hour to produce results.Akinwande and his group are working to improve its performance further, including by expanding the slate of viruses it can detect. With funding from the National Science Foundation, they are developing a sensor designed to test for SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as omicron and delta. While they are currently focusing on a two-variant design, the test could be adapted to simultaneously identify even more, they say.

  "text": "A new study has found that people who are currently suffering or face a high risk of post-traumatic stress disorder show particular patterns in four biomarkers that are measurable with a simple blood test. The findings suggest these biomarkers could be used to predict a person's likelihood of developing PTSD, diagnose the disorder or monitor the response to treatment.          PTSD can occur after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. It is currently diagnosed based on symptoms such as flashbacks, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, negative thoughts, memory problems and avoidance of triggering situations. Since other disorders can have some of these same symptoms, it can be challenging to diagnose PTSD and assess changes in response to treatment.This research, which involved over 1,000 service members, represents the largest prospective study to date to assess the biological markers of PTSD over time.\"This study provides valuable insights into the natural history of PTSD and the effectiveness of interventions, which can inform the development of treatment guidelines and improve the care for individuals suffering from PTSD,\" said Stacy-Ann Miller, a researcher at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. \"Better methods of predicting or screening for PTSD could help to overcome the disorder by identifying individuals at high risk of developing PTSD and providing them with early intervention or prevention strategies. This could potentially reduce the severity of symptoms or prevent the disorder from developing altogether.\"Miller will present the new research at Discover BMB, the annual meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, March 25\u201328 in Seattle.Biomarkers, which reflect biological processes, can provide an objective measure of physiological changes associated with diseases such as PTSD. For the study, researchers analyzed four biomarkers in blood samples from active-duty service members taken before a 10-month deployment, three days after their return and three to six months after their return. The biomarkers have previously been linked to stress, depression, anxiety and mental health disorders. They included: the glycolytic ratio, a measure of how the body breaks down sugar to produce energy; arginine, an amino acid that plays a role in the immune and cardiovascular systems; serotonin, a chemical messenger that helps regulate mood, sleep and other functions; and glutamate, a chemical messenger that plays a role in learning and memory.      The researchers divided service members into groups based on measures of PTSD and mental resilience and compared the four biomarkers among the different groups. Participants were classified as having PTSD, sub-threshold PTSD or no PTSD depending on their clinical diagnosis and PTSD symptoms. Researchers classified participants' resilience based on a combination of factors including PTSD, anxiety, sleep quality, alcohol use disorders, combat exposures, traumatic brain injury, and general physical and mental health. Previous studies have shown that people considered to have low resilience based on these measures are much more likely to develop PTSD after deployment than those with high resilience.Comparing these biomarkers in people with different PTSD status and levels of resilience, the results showed that those with PTSD or sub-threshold PTSD had significantly higher glycolytic ratio and lower arginine than those with high resilience. People with PTSD also had significantly lower serotonin and higher glutamate than those with high resilience. These associations were independent of factors such as gender, age, body mass index, smoking and caffeine consumption.The researchers said the biomarkers could help to predict which individuals face a high risk of PTSD, improve the accuracy of PTSD diagnosis and improve overall understanding of the drivers and effects of PTSD.\"Improved methods of screening and predicting PTSD could inform better treatment approaches by providing a deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of the disorder,\" said Miller. \"This could lead to the development of more targeted and effective treatments for PTSD or to identify specific subtypes of PTSD, which may respond differently to different treatments.\"Researchers cautioned that more research and validation would be needed to confirm the biomarkers' utility in real-world settings.The research was conducted in collaboration with the PTSD Systems Biology Consortium, a network of government and academic laboratories.

  "text": "Growing concerns over the potential health effects of exposure to phthalates, a component of many plastics and also known as a plasticizer, have led to a search for safer alternatives. In a new study conducted in cell cultures, researchers found that the chemical acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) might not be the best replacement because it appears to interfere with the growth and maintenance of neurons.          \"In the past, industries have promptly shifted away from the usage of toxic chemicals only to produce an equally toxic chemical, so this is something we are actively trying to avoid repeating,\" said Kyle Sease, a graduate student at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington. \"Our study suggests that ATBC, but not other non-phthalate alternatives, could interfere with cells that maintain brain health. We think this finding warrants further testing of ATBC at different doses, in different settings and in whole organism models.\"Sease will present the new research at Discover BMB, the annual meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, March 25\u201328 in Seattle.Phthalates are used in hundreds of products, often to enhance durability or allow materials to bend and stretch. Studies have shown that phthalate exposure can affect the reproductive system and early development in a range of animals, although the health impacts in humans are not clear. ATBC had emerged as a leading phthalate alternative as companies sought to shift away from phthalates; it is currently used in a variety of materials and products, including food and food packaging.For the study, researchers grew cultures of neuroblastoma cells, which in terms of growth and division, behave similarly to the glial cells that support and protect neurons in the brain. They then used molecular methods to study how ATBC and other chemicals affect genes and processes involved in cellular division. They found that neuroblastoma cells exposed to ATBC increased their expression of two genes associated with cellular stress (known as Nrf2 and p53) and also increased their production of an enzyme associated with cellular senescence (B-galactosidase), which can cause cells to stop growing and dividing.The findings suggest that ATBC could interfere with the ability for glial cells to regenerate, which can reduce their ability to protect neural cells and lead to neurodegeneration and accelerated aging. It is also possible that ATBC exposure during early development\u2014when neurons are actively growing and dividing\u2014could affect neurons directly and interfere with brain development, the researchers said. Since neurons do not typically regrow once damaged, any effects on the brain likely would be permanent.Two other phthalate alternatives, bis (2-ethylhexyl)-1, 4-benzenedicarboxylate (GPO) and dioctyl adipate (DOA), did not show the same effects as ATBC. \"We found that two other plasticizers did not appear to affect cell division in these cells, so further understanding the different effects of different plasticizers will allow us to understand better how to make safe ones,\" Sease said.

Researchers have synthesized five different hybrid materials containing a particular compound subunit of plutonium and chlorine: the [PuCl6]2- anion. They probed the anion's electronic structure and found that while the electrons in the plutonium-chlorine bonds were mostly not shared (ionic), they also featured important contributions from covalent bonds where the electrons are shared. These covalent bonds correlated with the 5f shell of the quantum-mechanical model of the atom. This shell is also the region of mismatch between scientists' observations and theories of how electrons are organized around atomic nuclei.The research is published in the journal Inorganic Chemistry.Researchers synthesized five different hybrid materials, (4XPyH)2[PuCl6], where X= H, Cl, Br, I, and (4IPyH)4[PuCl6]\u00b72Cl, from an acidic, chloride-rich aqueous media. The team included researchers from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), George Washington University, the University of Sa\u0303o Paulo, and the State University of New York at Buffalo. The researchers then probed the electronic structure of the [PuCl6]2- anion by using the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and natural localized molecular orbital analysis. The researchers delineated the underlying bond mechanism and hybrid atomic orbital contributions within the plutonium-ligand bonds. The research team also evaluated two related compounds that they had reported in previous papers. The researchers subjected materials containing the [PuO2Cl4]2- and [PuCl3(H2O)5] molecular units, to the same level of analysis to establish trends in bonding.The results revealed the Pu-Cl bonds were predominantly ionic, yet featured important covalent contributions that increased as bond polarity decreased from [PuCl3(H2O)5] < [PuO2Cl4]2- < [PuCl6]2-. Similarly, the Pu-based hybrid atomic orbitals in the Pu-Cl bonds exhibited decreased s and d orbital character, while the f orbital contribution increased. However, the Cl-based hybrid atomic orbitals did not vary significantly. This indicates that the 5f shell contributes to the covalent character of the Pu-Cl bond. This level of analysis provided valuable insight into the role of oxidation state, coordination geometry, and metal-ion charge in plutonium-ligand bond analysis.The results of this study help scientists understand and predict the chemical and physical behavior of transuranic elements\u2014elements beyond uranium in the periodic table. This is an important step toward advancing the design of next-generation nuclear materials. It could also help more effectively manage nuclear waste. By gaining new information on the role of the 5f shell in plutonium-chlorine bonds, this research contributes to the collective goal of resolving the f-electron challenge. Resolving this is the overarching goal of the Department of Energy Office of Science's Heavy Element Chemistry program. More information:Robert G.

  "text": "As new environmental regulations are rolling out to mitigate the industry-retired long-chain chemicals known as PFAS in drinking water, there are concerns regarding a new breed of \"forever chemicals\" called short-chain PFAS. Research from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is helping shift the focus to include mitigation of the chemicals\u2014which researchers say are just as persistent as, more mobile and harder to remove from the environment than their long-chain counterparts.          A study directed by chemical and biomolecular engineering professor Xiao Su uses electrosorption rather than filters and solvents and combines synthesis, separations testing and computer simulations to help design an electrode that can attract and capture a range of short-chain PFAS from environmental waters. The findings are published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\"One of the challenges of working with short-chain PFAS is that they are not well-studied. We know that they contain fewer carbon and fluorine atoms, making them shorter molecules and, therefore, more mobile\u2014or freer to interact within the natural environment,\" said Su, who collaborated with chemical and biomolecular engineering professor Diwakar Shukla. \"Their electrostatic properties differ and they are more hydrophilic, meaning they are more apt to bond with water molecules. These properties combined make them more difficult to separate from water than their long-chained counterparts.\"The differences among short- and long-chain PFAS\u2014and between long-chain PFAS in general\u2014are significant enough for Su's team to rethink its previously-developed electrode designed to attract, capture and destroy long-chain PFAS from the environment and drinking water sources. PFAS is an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.\"One way to think of the behavior of short-chain PFAS is that they don't like to be around anything except their own kind,\" Su said. \"So, to attract them, we need to sort of bait them with grafted fluorine groups\u2014the \"F' in PFAS\u2014on the surface of an electrode.\"Kinship is not the only challenge, though, Su said.\"The lengths of short-chain PFAS molecules vary, giving them different physical properties,\" Su said. \"This means we need to be able to tune the electrode just right to attract and eventually release the short-chain PFAS, with molecular-level understanding of the interactions being key to success.\"The study details the careful selection, matching and triangulating of different copolymer materials to develop an electrode that can attract a range of short-chain PFAS and induce an electric field to help release the molecules when needed.Su said this work is a critical early step in removing short-chain PFAS from the environment, which have replaced long-chain PFAS in many industries.\"We still have much work to do,\" Su said. \"Future studies will focus on coupling the electrodes developed in this study with electrochemical degradation methods to ensure removal of these persistent contaminants from the environment.\"Illinois researchers Anaira Rom\u00e1n Santiago, Jiho Lee and Johannes Elbert led the experimental investigations within the work, with graduate student Song Yin and Shukla leading the computational simulations.

  "text": "Rapid pregnancy and COVID-19 tests have a great advantage over other medical analyses: they are so simple that anyone can perform the test themselves, virtually anywhere. This is due to the robust principle behind these microfluidic methods, whereby aqueous solutions diffuse through a paper test strip with the aid of capillary forces. During this process, antibodies capture the target substances, such as virus particles or pregnancy hormones, and concentrate them at a desired location. A staining system then slowly makes the increasingly concentrated target substance visible as a stripe.          As simple and reliable as this basic principle is, visual assessment of the results can be difficult. The question of whether we really can see a line or whether we're just imagining it has probably been on all of our minds at least once since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.This is exactly where the invention of the ETH team comes in. They have found a way to form conductive electrodes directly inside the test strip paper. As the target substance is captured, it triggers an electronic signal. This makes measurements much faster, more sensitive and more accurate.Making low-cost paper technology betterChih-Jen Shih and Andrew deMello share a passion: \"Our biggest incentive is to improve basic chemical and biological experiments in ways that create new scientific opportunities.\" This is exactly what their research groups have now succeeded in doing with the rapid tests.A host of analytical applications benefit from the researchers' combining simple and cost-effective paper-based microfluidics with the sensitivity and accuracy of electronic measurement techniques. From patients being able to monitor blood biomarkers themselves, to soil, air and water sampling in the field, to disease testing in remote parts of the world in a matter of minutes\u2014the potential range of applications covers virtually all chemical, biological and medical analyses that can be performed in aqueous solutions.A combination of skills is the keyPrevious attempts to equip low-cost paper chemistry with detection electrodes have been hampered by a fundamental property of conductive materials: in principle, electrical conductors hardly interact with water and act as a barrier when it comes to the flow of sample and reaction mixtures in a paper strip.Overcoming this hurdle and developing the technology into a reliable process that also works in less developed areas of the world called for a combination of skills, deMello says. For the new rapid test, the ETH researchers therefore pooled their expertise. From Shih's group came the know-how to generate conductivity directly in the paper, while deMello's group brought their knowledge of microfluidic systems to the table.      A laser decomposes cellulose to pure carbonThe basis for this invention is the use of a laser to convert the sugar polymers that make up the cellulose in the paper into graphene. This special form of carbon is conductive and is considered an electronic material of the future.During laser conversion, the cellulose molecules are decomposed into their elements, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, in a process comparable to the caramelization of household sugar. However, while heating sugar in a pan for a long time leaves behind only ordinary carbon, which does not conduct electric current, the ETH Zurich scientists were able to use the laser to reorganize the carbon atoms of the cellulose into conductive graphene.Clever tuning of the laser energy makes the differenceProducing graphene in cellulose paper alone wouldn't do the trick, though, because\u2014like virtually all other conductive materials\u2014this miracle material is hydrophobic: it repels water, which means water cannot simply flow through it. However, by cleverly tuning the laser energy, the researchers can control the decomposition of the cellulose to graphene such that not only is the original porosity of the cellulose preserved, but individual oxygen groups of the cellulose remain intact on the surface of the graphene areas.These oxygen groups can interact with water molecules and thus ensure wettability in the electrodes, practically on a par with the rest of the paper. What's more, reporter molecules can also be chemically bound to these oxygen groups. In this way, an electronic signal is generated as soon as a virus particle interacts with a detection antibody on the electrode.Developing the science into a practical productThe researchers tuned the laser energy in two main ways: They treated the paper with flame retardants to prevent the laser energy from completely charring or even burning the cellulose. In addition, they reduced the laser power and instead used multiple pulses, which put less energy per unit area into the paper.However, Shih and deMello didn't content themselves with scientifically proving the principle of paper electrodes. Rather, their aspiration was to develop a product that could be used in practice. To this end, they implemented the principle in practical applications and massively simplified the production of the analytical paper strips. It already takes just 90 minutes to produce 176 sensors from one A4 sheet of paper\u2014at a unit cost of only 0.02 dollars.An ideal environment for interdisciplinary innovationsFor Shih, the environment at ETH Zurich played a decisive role in the invention: \"We're part of the Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences. As engineers, we're directly inspired by the cutting-edge research being done all around us.\"How the two chemical engineers will make their invention available to society and market it has yet to be determined. Given the enormously wide range of possible applications, a licensing model might make sense. But in this regard, too, the scientists can rely on the environment at ETH Zurich. deMello says, \"The people at ETH transfer have a lot of experience in protecting intellectual property and negotiating licensing agreements.\"Regardless of how the invention will find its way into concrete products, the bottom line is that countless people around the world are likely to benefit from this ETH innovation. From more effective medical therapies to more efficient agriculture and seamless infection monitoring\u2014embedding electrodes directly into the test strips takes the capabilities of paper fluidics to a new level.

  "text": "A team at UT Southwestern has developed a computational approach to uncover mechanisms of protein misfolding linked to neurodegenerative diseases. The study, published in Nature Communications, offers key insights that could help identify new treatments for patients.          The study analyzed structures of amyloid fibrils, which are made up of proteins that are normally soluble but have assembled in a way that makes them insoluble and often dangerous. Many types of amyloids are associated with different neurodegenerative diseases.\"Understanding the mechanisms of amyloid folding will help identify novel methods to treat protein misfolding diseases,\" said Lukasz Joachimiak, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Biochemistry and in the Center for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UTSW's Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute. Dr. Joachimiak is an Effie Marie Cain Scholar in Medical Research and the lead author of the study.According to Dr. Joachimiak, tau proteins play key roles in healthy brain cells. However, when a tau protein misfolds in a way that exposes certain motifs that allow it to self-replicate and build on itself, it wreaks havoc in the brain. This assembly of proteins creates distinct shapes of aggregated tau proteins that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases known as \"tauopathies.\" The study looked at conformations from diseases classified as tauopathies, including Alzheimer's and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.Using tau as a model protein, the computational approach developed by the researchers allowed them to estimate the energetics of interactions in structures of amyloid fibrils. By applying this to 27 distinct tau protein structures, they uncovered networks of interactions involved in stabilizing different amyloid fibril folds.This information was used to classify different tauopathies based on fibril structure conformation, opening the door to design tau sequences that only adopt a single conformation. The study is believed to be the first to computationally model the effect that mutations have on fibril structure stability\u2014an insight that will be essential in developing methods to predict these structures from the protein sequence alone.\"We are applying these methods to control folding of other amyloid-forming proteins that direct normal biological processes to begin to manipulate them,\" Dr. Joachimiak said.The study links the team's previous work that focused on the process of misfolding in an individual tau molecule with end-stage amyloid fibril conformations observed after onset of the disease.

  "text": "In addition to an antigen, many vaccines also contain substances, called adjuvants, which stimulate the immune system. By using computer-aided molecular design and machine learning, a Chinese research team has now developed two novel broad-spectrum adjuvants that can significantly amplify the immune response to vaccines. As reported in the journal Angewandte Chemie, they were able to enhance the effectiveness of immunization against certain forms of cancer in animal models.          Adjuvants amplify and prolong the effect of vaccine immunizations. Aluminum salts have been successfully used as adjuvants for many decades. Alternatively, there are oil-in-water emulsions that target pattern recognition receptors on immune cells. However, older versions of this type of adjuvant were not effective enough or had troublesome side effects. Newer versions are well-tolerated and effective but need to be tailored for every individual vaccine.By using computer-aided molecular design and machine learning, Bing Yan, Sijin Liu, and their team at the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences and the Capital Medical University in Beijing, as well as the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and Hangzhou, the Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, and the Guangzhou University, have now developed two novel adjuvants with broad-spectrum effectiveness that can significantly boost the immune response to vaccines.The new adjuvants are designed to bind to toll-like receptors (TLR), a class of proteins used by dendritic cells to detect the characteristic molecular patterns of pathogens. If an \"enemy\" is recognized, the dendritic cell moves into a lymph node and \"presents\" its find to the T-cells. These activated T-cells then multiply and enlist further immune cells in the fight.The team identified structural characteristics of the binding sites on human TLR and developed a collection, a substance library, with 46 different ligands that are compatible with the binding site. The special twist in this case is that these ligands are anchored to the surfaces of biocompatible gold nanoparticles.This causes them to be bound more easily by the TLR. Two of the ligands were found to be especially effective. Comprehensive in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies demonstrated that they bind to several different TLR and increase the activation of dendritic cells, presentation of antigens to T-cells, and their activation.Mice treated with tumor-specific antigens plus one of these new adjuvants demonstrated strong immune responses that suppressed tumor growth and lung metastases after implantation of specific cancer cells.Adjuvants further optimized through this method could reduce the problem of decreasing immunity for current vaccines and perhaps make booster vaccines unnecessary. Their use in immunotherapy to treat cancer is also highly promising.

Organic materials that efficiently absorb near-infrared light are essential for technological innovations that utilize near-infrared light, such as the dyes in the infrared blocking filters of smartphone cameras and security inks.

Previously, near-infrared absorbing organic materials were treated as closed-shell molecules without unpaired electrons. However, a joint research group led by Associate Professor Takeshi Maeda, Assistant Professor Daisuke Sakamaki, and Professor Hideki Fujiwara from Osaka Metropolitan University discovered that near-infrared absorbing oxocarbon-based dyes have an intermediate state between closed-shell and open-shell electronic configurations. They also found that as the wavelengths of near-infrared light absorbed increase, so does the contribution of open-shell forms in the dye.Their research results were published in Chemical Science on January 16, 2023.\"We have clarified the proper electronic structure of near-infrared absorbing oxocarbon-based dyes that are regarded as pure closed-shell molecules.

  "text": "A new study has uncovered a unique way in which the anti-cancer drug elesclomol enables copper delivery in cells, aiding in the search for treatments for copper deficiency disorders such as Menkes disease.          Menkes disease is an extremely rare hereditary copper-deficiency disorder in infants. It is characterized by progressive neurological injury culminating in death, typically by the age of three.A Texas A&M AgriLife Research team led by Vishal Gohil, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics in Texas A&M's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Bryan-College Station, first discovered the therapeutic potential of elesclomol for treating copper deficiency disorders. Additionally, previous research by Gohil's team showed that elesclomol could be used effectively in a mouse model to treat Menkes disease.The new study, \"FDX1-dependent and independent mechanisms of elesclomol-mediated intracellular copper delivery,\" was recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed journal of the National Academy of Sciences. The research was led by Gohil, with Mohammed Zulkifli, Ph.D., a research scientist in the same department, as the first author of the study.The study was conducted in collaboration with scientists from the University of Houston, Oregon Health and Science University, University of Missouri and the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy multidisciplinary science and engineering research center.Elesclomol and copper deficiency Genetic defects in copper transport to copper-containing enzymes, referred to as \"cuproenzymes,\" result in fatal disorders such as Menkes disease. No effective treatment is currently available for these copper deficiency disorders.\"To realize the full potential of elesclomol, it was necessary to gain a mechanistic understanding of how this drug makes copper available to different cellular cuproenzymes,\" Gohil said. \"We needed to look at the mechanism by which copper brought into cells by elesclomol is released and delivered to cuproenzymes present in different subcellular compartments.\"He said the study used a combination of biochemistry, cell biology and genetics to demonstrate that the release of copper from elesclomol occurs both inside and outside mitochondria.                Vishal Gohil, Ph.D., left, and Mohammad Zulkifli, Ph.D., right, in the Gohil Laboratory at Texas A&M University. Credit: Texas A&M AgriLife photo by Michael Miller             Copper and human health Copper is an essential trace element required for the activity and stability of several cuproenzymes involved in a wide array of physiological processes.\"Copper is an essential micronutrient, and genetic mutations that prevent copper transport across cellular membranes or its delivery to cuproenzymes can result in lethal human disorders such as Menkes disease,\" Gohil said.Currently, no Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies are available for treating Menkes disease. Additionally, direct administration of hydrophilic copper salts has shown limited efficacy in clinical trials.\"We hypothesized that this limited efficacy was likely due to inefficient copper delivery across cellular membranes, so there was an unmet need to identify compounds that can safely and effectively transport copper across biological membranes and restore cellular copper balance,\" Gohil said.The study Previous research had shown that ferredoxin 1, FDX1, a mitochondrial enzyme, was the protein target of elesclomol. In the current study, Gohil and his team showed that FDX1 releases copper bound to elesclomol by reducing it to a form of copper cells can use. The study also showed that even when FDX1 was absent, elesclomol could still bring some copper into cells in other unknown ways.Zulkifli said FDX1 can also help release copper from other clinically used copper-transporting drugs, but compared with elesclomol, these drugs are much less dependent on FDX1 to make the copper bioavailable to cuproenzymes.\"These modes of copper release by elesclomol are distinct from those of other currently used copper-transporting drugs,\" Zulkifli said. \"This may explain the high potency of elesclomol in rectifying copper deficiency.\"Building on past researchPrevious studies by Gohil and his team have highlighted the therapeutic potential of elesclomol in treating diseases of copper deficiency. Some of this previous research also showed that elesclomol can restore the levels of cytochrome c oxidase protein complex, a critical copper-dependent enzyme required for mitochondrial energy production.The Gohil lab also demonstrated that elesclomol improves copper deficiency in yeast, zebrafish and mouse models by delivering copper to mitochondria and restoring the function of the cytochrome c oxidase.Additionally, the use of elesclomol to treat copper deficiency disorders is at the center of a licensing agreement between The Texas A&M University System, managed through the Intellectual Property and Commercialization office of Texas A&M AgriLife Research, and California-based Engrail Therapeutics.

  "text": "For a long time it has been suspected that fullerene and its derivatives could form naturally in the universe. These are large carbon molecules shaped like a football, salad bowl or nanotube. An international team of researchers using the Swiss SLS synchrotron light source at PSI has shown how this reaction works. The results have just been published in the journal Nature Communications.          \"We are stardust, we are golden. We are billion-year-old carbon.\" In the song they performed at Woodstock, the US group Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young summarized what humans are essentially made of: star dust. Anyone with a little knowledge of astronomy can confirm the words of the cult American band\u2014both the planets and we humans are actually made up of dust from burnt-out supernovae and carbon compounds billions of years old. The universe is a giant reactor and understanding these reactions means understanding the origins and development of the universe\u2014and where humans come from.In the past, the formation of fullerenes and their derivatives in the universe has been a puzzle. These carbon molecules, in the shape of a football, bowl or small tube, were first created in the laboratory in the 1980s. In 2010 the infrared space telescope Spitzer discovered the C60 molecules with the characteristic shape of a soccer ball, known as buckyballs, in the planetary nebula Tc 1. They are therefore the biggest molecules to have been discovered to date known to exist in the universe beyond our solar system.But how do they actually form there? A team of researchers from Honolulu (U.S.), Miami (U.S.) and Tianjin (China) has now completed an important reaction step in the formation of the molecules, with active support from PSI and the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) beamline of the synchrotron light source Swiss SLS. \"PSI offers unique experimental facilities and that's why we decided to collaborate with Patrick Hemberger at PSI,\" says Ralf Kaiser from the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, the leading international researcher in this field.

The smallest nanobowl, corannulene, as well as the C40 nanobowl [2] emphasized as a molecular building block of Buckminsterfullerene (C60), rugbyballene (C70), and end-capped (5,5) armchair nanotubes. The C40 nanobowl carbons are black, the remaining carbons are gray, and the hydrogens are white. Credit: Nature Communications (2023). DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-37058-y             A mini reactor for fullerenePatrick Hemberger, a scientist working on the VUV beamline at PSI, has built a mini reactor for observing the formation of fullerene in real time. A corannulene radical (C20H9) is created in a reactor at a temperature of 1,000 degrees Celsius. This molecule looks like a salad bowl, as if it had been dissected from a C60 buckyball. This radical is highly reactive. It reacts with vinyl acetylene (C4H4), which deposits a layer of carbon onto the rim of the bowl.\"By repeating this process many times, the molecule would grow into the end cap of a nanotube. We have managed to demonstrate this phenomenon in computer simulations,\" explains Alexander Mebel, Professor of Chemistry at Florida International University and one of the authors of the study. But that was not the researchers' only goal: \"We wanted to show that this type of reaction is physically possible,\" Ralf Kaiser adds.The reaction produces different isomers\u2014molecules that all have the same mass, but slightly different structures. With standard mass spectrometry, all these variants produce the same signal. But the outcome is different when using photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy, the method adopted by the team. \"With this technique, the structure of the measurement curve allows conclusions to be drawn about each individual isomer,\" Patrick Hemberger explains.      Solving the puzzle of classic football-shaped molecules\"The universe contains a wild jungle of molecules and chemical reactions\u2014not all of them can be distinctly classified in the signals from telescopes,\" says Ralf Kaiser. We already know from models that both corannulene and vinylacetylene exist in the universe. Now it has been possible to confirm that these molecules actually form the building blocks to fullerene. \"That's why the experiment at PSI is so valuable for us.\"But the successful publication in Nature Communications is not the end of the story.

  "text": "Squids and octopuses are masters of camouflage, blending into their environment to evade predators or surprise prey. Some aspects of how these cephalopods become reversibly transparent are still \"unclear,\" largely because researchers can't culture cephalopod skin cells in the lab. Today, however, researchers report that they have replicated the tunable transparency of some squid skin cells in mammalian cells, which can be cultured. The work could not only shed light on basic squid biology, but also lead to better ways to image many cell types.          The researchers will present their results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.For many years, Alon Gorodetsky, Ph.D., and his research group have been working on materials inspired by squid. In past work, they developed \"invisibility stickers,\" which consisted of bacterially produced squid reflectin proteins that were adhered onto sticky tape. \"So then, we had this crazy idea to see whether we could capture some aspect of the ability of squid skin tissues to change transparency within human cell cultures,\" says Gorodetsky, who is the principal investigator on the project.The team at the University of California, Irvine focused their efforts on cephalopod cells called leucophores, which have particulate-like nanostructures composed of reflectin proteins that scatter light. Typically, reflectins clump together and form the nanoparticles, so light isn't absorbed or directly transmitted; instead, the light scatters or bounces off of them, making the leucophores appear bright white.\"We wanted to engineer mammalian cells to stably, instead of temporarily, form reflectin nanostructures for which we could better control the scattering of light,\" says Gorodetsky. That's because if cells allow light through with little scattering, they'll seem more transparent. Alternatively, by scattering a lot more light, cells will become opaque and more apparent. \"Then, at a cellular level, or even the culture level, we thought that we could predictably alter the cells' transparency relative to the surroundings or background,\" he says.To change how light interacts with cultured cells, Georgii Bogdanov, a graduate student in Gorodetsky's lab who is presenting the results, introduced squid-derived genes that encoded for reflectin into human cells, which then used the DNA to produce the protein. \"A key advance in our experiments was getting the cells to stably produce reflectin and form light-scattering nanostructures with relatively high refractive indices, which also allowed us to better image the cells in three dimensions,\" says Bogdanov.      In experiments, the team added salt to the cells' culture media and observed the reflectin proteins clumping together into nanostructures. By systematically increasing the salt concentration, Bogdanov got detailed, time-lapse 3D images of the nanostructures' properties. As the nanoparticles became larger, the amount of light that bounced off the cells increased, consequently tuning their opacity.Then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, leaving the researchers to wonder what they could do to advance their investigation without being physically in the lab. So, Bogdanov spent his time at home developing computational models that could predict a cell's expected light scattering and transparency before an experiment was even run. \"It's a beautiful loop between theory and experiments, where you feed in design parameters for the reflectin nanostructures, get out specific predicted optical properties and then engineer the cells more efficiently\u2014for whatever light-scattering properties you might be interested in,\" explains Gorodetsky.On a basic level, Gorodetsky suggests that these results will help scientists better understand squid skin cells, which haven't been successfully cultured in a laboratory setting. For example, previous researchers postulated that reflectin nanoparticles disassemble and reassemble to change the transparency of tunable squid leucophores. And now Gorodetsky's team has shown that similar rearrangements occurred in their stable engineered mammalian cells with simple changes in salt concentration, a mechanism that appears analogous to what has been observed in the tunable squid cells.The researchers are now optimizing their technique to design better cellular imaging strategies based on the cells' intrinsic optical properties. Gorodetsky envisions that the reflectin proteins could act as genetically encoded tags that would not bleach inside human cells. \"Reflectin as a molecular probe provides a lot of possibilities to track structures in cells with advanced microscopy techniques,\" adds Bogdanov. For example, the scientists propose that imaging approaches based on their work could also have implications for better understanding cell growth and development.

  "text": "Nobody likes needles, but they're necessary for delivering many vaccines and biologics into the body. But what if those could be puffed through the skin instead, with just a little pressure, like being hit in the arm with a foam toy? Today, scientists report steps toward making that a reality. Using powdered vaccines that don't require refrigeration and a system driven by compressed gas, their \"MOF-Jet\" could easily deliver therapeutics against cancer and other diseases in a relatively painless way.          The researchers will present their results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.The idea for the project was formed out of pandemic-induced boredom. The project's principal investigator, Jeremiah Gassensmith, Ph.D., had ordered inexpensive pieces of a compressed gas-powered jet injection system to mess around with while stuck at home. Later, after everyone was back on campus, he handed the pieces over to Yalini Wijesundara, a graduate student in the lab, with the instructions, \"See what you can do with this.\"Wijesundara, who is presenting the work at the meeting, took these instructions in stride. She had previously researched other jet injectors dating back to the 1960s that use compressed gas to inject a narrow stream of fluid. If the injectors could be modified to fire solids, she figured, they could deliver cargo encased in metal-organic frameworks, or MOFs, as well. These frameworks are porous, crystalline structures that act like molecular \"cages\" to encapsulate a wide variety of materials, including nucleic acids and proteins. By combining the jet injector with the lab's existing work on MOFs, Wijesundara created a \"MOF-Jet.\" The jet can deliver powders to cells by, quite literally, shooting them in with air. Both Gassensmith and Wijesundara are at The University of Texas at Dallas.Jet injectors previously saw widespread use in the military, but they were painful and the fluid often splashed back, potentially spreading other diseases such as Hepatitis B. A modern-day descendant is the \"gene gun,\" which is typically used in veterinary medicine and can cost tens of thousands of dollars. These devices also shoot biological cargo into cells. In this case, the cargo is attached to the surface of a metal microparticle, typically made of gold or tungsten. But once it penetrates the skin, the metal particles remain there and can speed up the degradation of the biological material.      A different strategy would be to put the cargo inside a MOF. Gassensmith's group previously worked with the MOF called zeolitic-imidazolate framework eight, or ZIF-8. \"Compared to gold, it's cheap and protects biological materials, such as nucleic acids,\" explains Wijesundara. \"We can also store vaccine formulations within it as powders at room temperature, which eliminates the need for the extremely cold temperatures many liquid vaccines require.\"The team encased a variety of biological materials within ZIF-8, which protected them from being broken down too quickly. To deliver the materials into cells, the team used their own modified, gene gun-inspired \"MOF-Jet.\" Wijesundara created \"bullets\" for the device, each loaded with a dose of functionalized ZIF-8, and a puff of gas fired the powdered formulation into cells, which was as easy as just \"pointing and shooting.\" They tested their system and showed that the MOF-Jet delivered a ZIF-8-encased gene to onion cells and a ZIF-8-encased protein to mice. According to Gassensmith, the blast from the injector just feels \"like you got hit with a Nerf bullet\"\u2014much less painful than being stuck with a needle.By tinkering with the MOF-Jet, Wijesundara soon realized that cargo release could be tuned by simply changing the injector's carrier gas. ZIF-8 is sensitive to acidic environments, and when carbon dioxide reacts with water in cells, it makes carbonic acid that, in turn, helps break apart the MOF. \"If you shoot it with carbon dioxide, it will release its cargo faster within cells; if you use regular air, it will take four or five days,\" she explains. This means that the same drug could be released over different timescales without changing its formulation. \"Once we realized that, it opened up a lot of possibilities,\" says Gassensmith.The team is now using this method to deliver chemotherapeutics and adjuvants as a potential treatment for melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. They say that because the MOF-Jet can disperse material over a wide area, it could distribute a cancer therapeutic into a melanoma more evenly than with a needle, which is the current delivery method. And simply by controlling the carrier gas, they could deliver chemotherapeutics with a fast- or slow-release timeframe, depending on a patient's needs. Though research is still ongoing, preliminary experiments are yielding promising results. Wijesundara and Gassensmith say that the adaptability of their MOF-Jet could allow a wide number of applications, from veterinary medicine to agriculture, or someday even human vaccinations or treatments.

  "answer_squad": " ACS Spring 2023",
  "text": "In chemistry, we have He, Fe and Ca\u2014but what about do, re and mi? Hauntingly beautiful melodies aren't the first things that come to mind when looking at the periodic table of the elements. However, using a technique called data sonification, a recent college graduate has converted the visible light given off by the elements into audio, creating unique, complex sounds for each one. Today, the researcher reports the first step toward an interactive, musical periodic table.          The researcher will present his results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.Previously, W. Walker Smith, the project's sole investigator, took his combined passions of music and chemistry and converted the natural vibrations of molecules into a musical composition. \"Then I saw visual representations of the discrete wavelengths of light released by the elements, such as scandium,\" says Smith. \"They were gorgeous and complex, and I thought, 'Wow, I really want to turn these into music, too.'\"Elements emit visible light when they are energized. This light is made up of multiple individual wavelengths, or particular colors, with brightness levels that are unique for each element. But on paper, the collections of wavelengths for different elements are hard to tell apart visually, especially for the transition metals, which can have thousands of individual colors, says Smith. Converting the light into sound frequencies could be another way for people to detect the differences between elements.However, creating sounds for the elements on the periodic table has been done before. For instance, other scientists have assigned the brightest wavelengths to single notes played by the keys on a traditional piano. But this approach reduced the rich variety of wavelengths released by some elements into just a few sounds, explains Smith, who is currently a researcher at Indiana University.To retain as much of the complexity and nuance of the element spectra as possible, Smith consulted faculty mentors at Indiana University, including David Clemmer, Ph.D., a professor in the chemistry department, and Chi Wang, D.M.A., a professor in the Jacobs School of Music. With their assistance, Smith built a computer code for real-time audio that converted each element's light data into mixtures of notes. The discrete color wavelengths became individual sine waves whose frequency corresponded to that of the light, and their amplitude matched the brightness of the light.      Early in the research process, Clemmer and Smith discussed the pattern similarities between light and sound vibrations. For instance, within the colors of visible light, violet has almost double the frequency of red, and in music, one doubling of frequency corresponds to an octave. Therefore, visible light can be thought of as an \"octave of light.\" But this octave of light is at a much higher frequency than the audible range. So, Smith scaled the sine waves' frequencies down by approximately 10-12, fitting the audio output into a range where human ears are most sensitive to differences in pitch.Because some elements had hundreds or thousands of frequencies, the code allowed these notes to be generated in real time, forming harmonies and beating patterns as they mixed together. \"The result is that the simpler elements, such as hydrogen and helium, sound vaguely like musical chords, but the rest have a more complex collection of sounds,\" says Smith. For example, calcium sounds like bells chiming together with a rhythm resulting from how the frequencies interact with each other. Listening to the notes from some other elements reminded Smith of a spooky background noise, similar to music used in cheesy horror movies. He was especially surprised by the element zinc, which despite having a large number of colors, sounded like \"an angelic choir singing a major chord with vibrato.\"\"Some of the notes sound out of tune, but Smith has kept true to that in this translation of the elements into music,\" says Clemmer. These off-key tones\u2014known musically as microtones\u2014come from frequencies that are found between the keys of a traditional piano. Agreeing, Wang says, \"The decisions as to what's vital to preserve when doing data sonification are both challenging and rewarding. And Smith did a great job making such decisions from a musical standpoint.\"The next step is to turn this technology into a new musical instrument with an exhibit at the WonderLab Museum of Science, Health, and Technology in Bloomington, Indiana. \"I want to create an interactive, real-time musical periodic table, which allows both children and adults to select an element and see a display of its visible light spectrum and hear it at the same time,\" says Smith. He adds that this sound-based approach has potential value as an alternative teaching method in chemistry classrooms, because it's inclusive to people with visual impairments and different learning styles.On Tuesday, March 28, at 3:00 p.m., during the ACS Spring 2023 Meeting, Smith will also perform \"The Sound of Molecules,\" a show that will feature audio clips of a few of the elements, as well as \"compositions\" of larger molecules.

  "text": "Black women and others with curly or kinky hair encounter a vast and confusing array of haircare options. Advice on the best products to use for a certain type of hair is often contradictory, and the results can be highly variable. Now, scientists are bringing order to this chaos by identifying properties such as the number of curls or coils in a given length of hair that could eventually help users pick the perfect product and achieve consistent results.          The researchers will present their findings today at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.\"As an African American, I was born with very curly, seemingly unmanageable hair, and other ethnicities can possess similar hair properties,\" says Michelle Gaines, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator. Gaines used to rely on chemical relaxers to straighten her tresses but stopped when she became pregnant. She was then confronted with an overwhelming variety of products available to style and care for natural hair. Limited guidance about the best options for her particular hair type, and conflicting advice from friends, YouTube videos and other resources, didn't help the situation.Clearly, Gaines says, there is a major knowledge gap that needs to be closed, so she has set out to fill it. \"As a polymer chemist and materials scientist, I thought it would be great to start a project where I could study the nuances of my hair, because I felt like it wasn't very well understood,\" she says.Most prior research on properties was done on wavy or straight strands from white or Asian people, according to Gaines, who is at Spelman College, a historically Black college for women. Less is known about what has traditionally been called \"African\" hair, she says, though researchers at Groote Schuur Hospital and the University of Cape Town in South Africa have published some findings.L'Or\u00e9al, as well as celebrity hair stylist Andre Walker and others, have developed systems to classify different types of hair. Walker's system ranges from straight to kinky, a category including tight coils and zig-zag strands with angular bends. Although some people believe all of these classification methods convey a preference for a smoother and straighter appearance\u2014a bias with historic links to the preferential treatment of enslaved people who had straighter hair and lighter skin\u2014they're intended to help users choose the most suitable haircare products. Gaines felt these systems worked well for straight and wavy hair but lacked the nuance to distinguish the many varieties of curly and kinky hair.      Gaines wanted to see if she could identify differences in properties other than curl shape and tightness, and then use those differences to develop a more precise and quantitative classification system. Undergraduates at Spelman eagerly lined up to help. Gaines and her student, Imani Page, are collaborating with Alfred Crosby, Ph.D., and Gregory Grason, Ph.D., at the University of Massachusetts Amherst; their expertise includes material property characterization and modeling of complex materials and soft matter.The team measured the mechanical properties of wavy, curly and kinky hairs with a texture analyzer and a dynamic mechanical analyzer. These instruments measure force, stress and other parameters as a strand is first uncurled and then stretched until it breaks.Among other findings, the team recently reported results for the \"stretch ratio,\" a new parameter they developed to quantify and compare the force required to uncurl a strand until it's straight. That ratio was found to be negligible for straight hair (since it can't be uncurled), about 0.8 for wavy, 1.1 for kinky and 1.4 for curly. This measurement could therefore be used as an indicator of the initial curliness of a sample, providing a quantifiable way to distinguish between these types.The team also measured geometric properties, such as the diameter, cross section and 3D shape of strands, using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a camera. In addition, the researchers developed new parameters, including the number of complete waves, curls or coils\u2014known as contours\u2014that they measured on 3-cm lengths of hair. They found that wavy hair has less than one full contour in that length, curly has about two, and kinky/coily has approximately three or more. The results suggest that people will be able to classify their own hair by counting contours, Gaines says.In the latest work, Gaines has begun examining the layer that protects the surface of each hair fiber. Known as the cuticle, it consists of flat cells that overlap each other, like roof shingles. Cuticles have a natural tendency to open and close reversibly when exposed to water, shampoo and conditioner. However, excessive acid and moisture retention can cause permanent damage to the cuticles, causing them to remain irreversibly lifted, thus exposing the inner cortex of the hair fiber. Irreversibly lifted cuticles, and cuticles that easily open and close, make the strand more porous, which causes more moisture absorption. Gaines' preliminary findings show the cuticle layers are larger and spaced further apart in wavy hair than in curly and coily hair. Also, the cuticle edges are smoother in wavy hair. These findings could help the researchers explain why curly and coily locks dry out faster than wavy and straight tresses. Ultimately, Gaines hopes, the team's findings will identify the best parameters for developers to design and for consumers to select the most suitable products for each of the wondrously varied categories of hair.

  "text": "Higher alcohols (C2+ alcohols), which are important raw materials, have been used as the intermediates of valued products. They are also widely applied in various fields of fuel, food, fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and energy.          With the gradual depletion of petroleum resources, the direct synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas has become a sustainable and potential process because of its wide source of raw materials and high atomic utilization. However, the low yield of higher alcohols restricted industrial application.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Sun Jian and Prof. Ge Qingjie from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has realized the direct synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas and achieved the highly selective production of higher alcohols from CO hydrogenation over synergistic iron carbides catalysts.This study was published in Chem Catalysis.\"The proposed synergistic Ca-Fe series catalysts could realize a oxygenate selectivity of 69.7 wt% under mild conditions, alongside the alcohols fraction of 86.4 % in oxygenates,\" said Prof. Sun. \"The total oxygenates and alcohols selectivity outperformed the results of previously reported catalysts.\"With multiple characterizations, the researchers found that the Ca loading enabled the Ca-Fe catalyst to have high surface iron carbides with a proper Fe2C/(Fe5C2+Fe3C) ratio. The Fe5C2 and Fe3C as CO dissociative sites could be assisted by a synergistic effect with Fe2C (CO non-dissociative sites) to produce higher alcohols.Therefore, the proper Fe2C/(Fe5C2+Fe3C) ratio facilitated the balance of the CO dissociative and non-dissociative abilities, and boosted the better cooperation of *CO and *CHx to form the *CHx-*CO species, further promoting the higher alcohols formation.\"This study extends the understanding of the important role of Ca and provides a new strategy for the design of catalysts in CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols,\" said Prof. Sun.

  "text": "Photosynthesis drives all life on Earth. Complex processes are required for the sunlight-powered conversion of carbon dioxide and water to energy-rich sugar and oxygen. These processes are driven by two protein complexes, photosystems I and II. In photosystem I, sunlight is used with an efficiency of almost 100%. Here a complex network of 288 chlorophylls plays the decisive role.          A team led by LMU chemist Regina de Vivie-Riedle has now characterized these chlorophylls with the help of high-precision quantum chemical calculations\u2014an important milestone toward a comprehensive understanding of energy transfer in this system. This discovery may help exploit its efficiency in artificial systems in the future.The chlorophylls in photosystem I capture sunlight in an antenna complex and transfer the energy to a reaction center. There, the solar energy is used to trigger a redox process\u2014that is to say, a chemical process whereby electrons are transferred. The quantum yield of photosystem I is almost 100%, meaning that almost every absorbed photon leads to a redox event in the reaction center.Simulation under natural conditions\"Although the complicated energy transfer inside the photosystem has been studied for decades, there is no consensus up to today about the exact mechanism,\" says de Vivie-Riedle. To gain deeper insights, the researchers simulated the light excitation of all chlorophylls in a model of photosystem I embedded in a lipid membrane. A highly accurate multireference method was used to calculate the electronic excitations. Compared to earlier studies, this approach allows the photosystem I to be described on the basis of state-of-the-art methodology. The complicated calculations were made possible by the supercomputer at the Leibniz Supercomputing Center.The results of the study, which is featured on the cover of the journal Chemical Science, reveal so-called \"red chlorophylls\" that absorb light at slightly lower energies than their neighbors due to ambient electrostatic effects. As a result, their absorption spectrum is red-shifted. Analogously, the researchers also identified energy barriers between the antenna complex and the reaction center, among other places. \"This seems surprising at first glance because there is no obvious gradient along which energy is transferred from the antenna complex to the reaction center,\" explains lead author Sebastian Reiter.Fluctuations overcome energy barriersUnder physiological conditions, however, the entire photosystem I is subject to thermal fluctuations that overcome these energy barriers, as the relative energies of the chlorophylls change with respect to each other. In this way, new pathways into the reaction center can constantly open up, while others close. This, according to the core thesis of the authors, could be the key to the high efficiency of photosystem I.\"Our atomistic simulation of these processes enables a microscopic understanding of the system and its dynamics in its natural environment, complementary to experimental approaches,\" concludes Regina de Vivie-Riedle, who is also a member of the e-conversion cluster of excellence.One of the goals of the cluster is to one day transfer the efficiency of natural photocatalysts to artificial nano-bio hybrid systems for applications such as the production of hydrogen as an energy carrier or the conversion of carbon monoxide into fuel. This requires a better understanding of the energy transfer mechanism. With their results on photosystem I, the scientists have now taken an important step toward the realization of this goal.

  "text": "A team of chemists and computer scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, the University of California and Institut des Sciences et Ingenierie Chimiques, Ecole, have developed an ecosystem of tools to boost machine-learning-based design of metal-organic frameworks.          In their study, reported in the journal ACS Central Science, Kevin Maik Jablonka, Andrew Rosen, Aditi Krishnapriyan and Berend Smit coded tools to convert data into machine learning inputs to create a system to boost machine-learning frameworks.Reticular chemistry is the science of designing and synthesizing porous crystalline materials with certain predefined structures and properties (building blocks). These materials, known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have applications in gas storage, separation, catalysis, sensing and drug delivery.Unfortunately, the discovery and optimization of new MOFs is still largely based on trial-and-error experiments, which is time-consuming and costly. To speed up the development of reticular chemistry, some of the members of the current team created a package of applications called Mofdscribe and released it for use by the general public back in 2022.Since that time, Mofdscribe has been used by many chemists to help them create distinct MOFs. The current team recognized that Mofdscribe had some limitations, however, and set out to create a more useful system.To that end, the researchers created code that allowed for integrating computational modeling, machine learning, data mining and high-throughput screening. They also resolved a problem that involved the data used to train machine-learning algorithms leaking into test sets. One of their goals, they note, was to create dataset analysis tools researchers do not yet need, but likely will at some point. This, they suggest, should help in comparing performance differences between machine learning systems.The result was what the team describes as an \"ecosystem\"\u2014an environment where chemists could go to work out new machine-learning approaches to creating MOFs with desired functions and properties.

  "text": "A team led by Dr. Ha Yoon-Cheol, a Principal Researcher of Next Generation Battery Research Center at the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI) and Dr. Cheol-Min Park, a Professor of School of Materials Science and Engineering at Kumoh National Institute of Technology (KIT), has developed a low-cost production technology for silicon disulfide (SiS2) for solid-state electrolytes (argyrodite-type) that has potential to accelerate the commercialization of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs).          ASSBs replace the liquid-state electrolytes that transfer ions between the anode and cathode with a solid less prone to fire or explosion. However, there remain many challenges to achieve commercialization, e.g., difficulties in processing and mass production, high material cost, etc. Many research groups across the globe are working hard to tackle these challenges, and KERI has also shown several achievements.In this study, Dr. Ha's team chose silicon disulfide. It is widely known in academia that adding silicon disulfide to solid-state electrolytes for ASSBs helps improve ionic conductivity and moisture stability. However, the synthesis of silicon disulfide from sulfur and silicon requires a high reaction temperature, which leads to surges in the vapor pressure of sulfur, making the silicon disulfide production process particularly tricky. For this reason, silicon disulfide is a very expensive material, which currently costs about KRW 1.7 million per 20 grams.KERI has developed a processing technology for the optimal production of silicon disulfide and paved the way for its application in solid-state electrolytes for ASSBs. The team succeeded in establishing synthesis conditions by optimizing the arrangement of sulfur and silicon powders and creating a perfectly sealed environment to withstand the vapor pressure of sulfur at 800 degrees of reaction temperature. The quality of the resulting product was comparable to the commercially available products. The team made solid-state electrolytes using their silicon disulfide and found that it had more than twice the ionic conductivity and moisture stability. Also, the optimized process will help simplify the production and reduce production costs.\"Many researchers at home and abroad have struggled to address the elevated vapor pressure of sulfur, which required using expensive raw materials or introducing special processes,\" said Dr. Ha. \"What we have achieved will contribute to producing silicon disulfide for solid-state electrolytes cheaper and easier.\"The team also applied the new silicon disulfide as an anode active material for liquid electrolyte-based lithium-ion batteries and identified the destruction and recovery of layered structures during charging and discharging for the first time. The team's findings from their silicon disulfide study were published as the cover article in the recent edition of the Journal of Materials Chemistry A.

  "text": "Quebec is a leader in maple syrup production and its \"liquid gold\" is world-renowned for its quality. To maintain this high standard, the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers association has partnered with scientists at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al to develop a portable test to predict the quality of the syrup based on the harvested sap.          Dubbed the \"COLORI test,\" the method developed by UdeM's chemists and mathematicians has been scientifically validated. The results were published Tuesday, March 21, in the journal ACS Food Science & Technology.\"Thanks to the support of the Consortium for Research and Innovation in Industrial Bioprocesses in Quebec, we were able to develop the COLORI test, patent it and produce the first 250 units,\" said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Masson, an UdeM chemistry professor and lead co-author of the scientific paper. \"All the tests have already been used by the maple syrup producers who participated in our project.\"Fast and simple nanotechnologyThe new COLORI test belongs to the nanotechnology family, and using it is quick and easy. It starts with a small tube containing a solution of gold nanoparticles, to which several drops of sap are added. The amino acids and the amines, which correlate with specific changes in the flavor of maple syrup, bind to the gold nanoparticles, causing them to group together and change the way light interacts with the solution. As a result, the solution changes color from red to blue\u2014a change that can be observed with the naked eye within minutes.The main advantage of this test is that it can be used at the sugar shack, where the results can be immediately interpreted and acted upon. This highly sensitive and therefore highly effective method provides reliable information about the properties of maple sap in real-time to support the production of high-quality maple syrup.\"We encourage partnerships between companies and the public research community to create innovative solutions that meet specific needs and are commercially viable,\" said the Consortium's president and CEO, Mohammed Benyagoub. \"The innovative COLORI project aligns with our mission to strengthen relationships and industry-university collaborative research by helping Quebec's maple syrup industry ensure optimal purity of the syrup it brings to market.\"From detection to predictionThe COLORI test for identifying undesirable compounds in maple products is based on an earlier method developed in Masson's lab in 2018 in collaboration with Simon Forest, then Masson's research officer and now project manager for development and applied research at the producers' association. The first version of the test correlated the intensity of natural aromatic profiles of maple syrup (such as flavor profiles associated with sap and bud characteristics) to the result of the test.\"The COLORI test, which is now in its second version, has become predictive: it works with the maple sap and can determine if the compounds present in the sap harvested by the producer will yield high-quality maple syrup,\" explained Forest, who also holds a master's degree in chemistry from UdeM. \"The test has proved useful as a decision-support tool: for example, to decide whether or not to boil sap that would not produce the desired quality of syrup.\"To move from the first-generation COLORI test to the predictive COLORI test, which provides information on the organoleptic profile of the sap, the two chemists asked QMSP to co-develop the new version of the test using a participatory science approach. This new COLORI test, which requires minimal infrastructure at the sugar shacks, was made possible by the involvement of several maple syrup producers, who participated in three phases of field tests.Masson and Forest also called on the research team of Morgan Craig, an UdeM mathematics professor, to build a mathematical model that predicts the type of maple syrup that will be produced based on the molecular profile of the sap, including its amino acids. \"Their model provides a sense of what the final product will be like, and allows maple syrup producers to better manage production,\" Masson explained.Credit: University of MontrealSoon to be widely availableMaple syrup production is one of the main drivers of Quebec's biofood sector. The maple syrup industry contributed $1 billion to Quebec's gross domestic product in 2022. With 13,300 maple syrup producers and total production of 95 million kilograms in 2022, the province is the world's leading producer of maple syrup, accounting for nearly three quarters of global production.To establish its market value, Quebec maple syrup is rigorously tasted, inspected, checked and classified according to criteria set out in the Convention de mise en march\u00e9 du sirop d'\u00e9rable, a marketing agreement developed by the QMSP. Large-scale deployment of the COLORI test would allow maple syrup producers to evaluate and classify maple sap at little cost before turning it into maple syrup, and would help them manage their production throughout the season.\"Quality is a top priority for Quebec's maple syrup producers,\" said Luc Goulet, president of the producers' association. \"The COLORI test, which will be widely available as of 2024, offers our industry a unique tool to fine-tune our processes and maintain the reputation of Quebec maple syrup.\" More information:Simon Forest et al, Prediction of Maple Syrup Quality from Maple Sap with a Plasmonic Tongue and Ordinal Mixed-Effects Modeling, ACS Food Science & Technology (2023).

  "text": "While it can take years for the pharmaceutical industry to create medicines capable of treating or curing human disease, a new study suggests that using generative artificial intelligence could vastly accelerate the drug-development process.          Today, most drug discovery is carried out by human chemists who rely on their knowledge and experience to select and synthesize the right molecules needed to become the safe and efficient medicines we depend on. To identify the synthesis paths, scientists often employ a technique called retrosynthesis\u2014a method for creating potential drugs by working backward from the wanted molecules and searching for chemical reactions to make them.Yet because sifting through millions of potential chemical reactions can be an extremely challenging and time-consuming endeavor, researchers at The Ohio State University have created an AI framework called G2Retro to automatically generate reactions for any given molecule. The new study showed that compared to current manual-planning methods, the framework was able to cover an enormous range of possible chemical reactions as well as accurately and quickly discern which reactions might work best to create a given drug molecule.\"Using AI for things critical to saving human lives, such as medicine, is what we really want to focus on,\" said Xia Ning, lead author of the study and an associate professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State. \"Our aim was to use AI to accelerate the drug design process, and we found that it not only saves researchers time and money but provides drug candidates that may have much better properties than any molecules that exist in nature.\"This study builds on previous research of Ning's where her team developed a method named Modof that was able to generate molecule structures that exhibited desired properties better than any existing molecules. \"Now the question becomes how to make such generated molecules, and that is where this new study shines,\" said Ning, also an associate professor of biomedical informatics in the College of Medicine.The study was published today in the journal Communications Chemistry.Ning's team trained G2Retro on a dataset that contains 40,000 chemical reactions collected between 1976 and 2016. The framework \"learns\" from graph-based representations of given molecules, and uses deep neural networks to generate possible reactant structures that could be used to synthesize them. Its generative power is so impressive that, according to Ning, once given a molecule, G2Retro could come up with hundreds of new reaction predictions in only a few minutes.\"Our generative AI method G2Retro is able to supply multiple different synthesis routes and options, as well as a way to rank different options for each molecule,\" said Ning. \"This is not going to replace current lab-based experiments, but it will offer more and better drug options so experiments can be prioritized and focused much faster.\"To further test the AI's effectiveness, Ning's team conducted a case study to see if G2Retro could accurately predict four newly released drugs already in circulation: Mitapivat, a medication used to treat hemolytic anemia; Tapinarof, which is used to treat various skin diseases; Mavacamten, a drug to treat systemic heart failure; and Oteseconazole, used to treat fungal infections in females. G2Retro was able to correctly generate exactly the same patented synthesis routes for these medicines, and provided alternative synthesis routes that are also feasible and synthetically useful, Ning said.Having such a dynamic and effective device at scientists' disposal could enable the industry to manufacture stronger drugs at a quicker pace\u2014but despite the edge AI might give scientists inside the lab, Ning emphasizes the medicines G2Retro or any generative AI creates still need to be validated\u2014a process that involves the created molecules being tested in animal models and later in human trials.\"We are very excited about generative AI for medicine, and we are dedicated to using AI responsibly to improve human health,\" said Ning.

  "text": "An international study led by Monash University has, for the first time, harnessed cutting-edge technology to reveal new and unprecedented information of how a special class of drugs, known as \"allosteric modulators\" work at the M4 muscarinic receptor, a major target for notoriously difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive deficits, such as schizophrenia.          Muscarinic receptors are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)\u2014the largest drug target class encoded by the human genome. The M4 muscarinic receptor subtype, in particular, plays a vital role in regulating neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and glutamate, in key areas of the brain involved in psychosis and cognition, but, until recently, was notoriously difficult to selectively target by conventional agonists or antagonists.This challenge has begun to be addressed in recent years with the discovery of highly selective allosteric modulators for this receptor, but how such drugs achieve their selectivity and regulate M4 receptor activity in response to different activators has remained a major, elusive, knowledge gap, despite high clinical implications.The new study, published in eLife, and led by a team of researchers from the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (MIPS), has now addressed this important gap in our molecular-level understanding of how allosteric modulators mediate their effects at the M4 muscarinic receptor.In this study, the MIPS researchers (who are world-leaders in the discovery and development of next-generation neuromedicines, including allosteric modulators, for difficult-to-treat mental illnesses), rigorously quantified the pharmacological properties of two distinct 'positive' allosteric modulators, alone or in combination with two different agonists, at the human M4 muscarinic receptor.The team also tapped into technological advancements in the fields of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics simulations to unlock first-of-its-kind evidence of key molecular mechanisms underlying allosteric pharmacology, advancing our understanding of the structural basis of allosteric modulation of the M4 muscarinic receptor and paving the way for the discovery and design of future allosteric drugs.      In particular, the researchers revealed a vital role for ligand\u2013receptor\u2013G protein complex stability, mediated by conformational dynamics between these sites, in the ultimate determination of affinity, efficacy, degree of allosteric modulation, and mechanisms underlying species variability of allosteric drugs, all of which have significant implications for preclinical-to-clinical discovery and translation of such agents.Corresponding author, and MIPS Senior Research Fellow, Dr. David Thal, said that allosteric modulation of GPCRs is a major paradigm in drug discovery; however, despite decades of research, a molecular-level understanding of the general principles that govern the myriad pharmacological effects exerted by GPCR allosteric modulators has remained elusive.\"By determining the cryo-EM structures of the M4 muscarinic receptor and applying molecular dynamics simulations, the team has provided a holistic framework for further GPCR mechanistic studies and, in turn, opened up new approaches for GPCR drug discovery,\" said Dr. Thal.Professor Arthur Christopoulos, FAA FAHMS, also a corresponding author on the study, Dean of the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Director of Monash's Neuromedicines Discovery Centre, said the results have broader implications for the development of new allosteric medicines designed to reduce currently untreated symptoms associated with schizophrenia and cognitive disorders.\"The vast majority of patients with schizophrenia have impaired cognition, which is untreated by any existing antipsychotic drug, and its severity remains a major predictor of prognosis. However the development of new safe and effective treatments has remained stagnant for decades,\" said Professor Christopoulos.\"The research conducted in this study is a vital step toward progressing the next generation of medical therapies and innovations that could make a true impact when it comes to improving health and saving lives.\"Dr. Celine Valant, also a corresponding author and Senior Research Fellow at MIPS, said the findings open up exciting new opportunities.\"The evidence presented in this study will enable future GPCR drug discovery research and potentially lead to the development of next generation medicines for the treatment of a range of psychiatric and cognitive disorders,\" said Dr. Valant.

  "text": "Proteins are biological molecules that perform almost all biochemical tasks in all forms of life. In doing so, the tiny structures perform ultra-fast movements. In order to investigate these dynamic processes more precisely than before, researchers have developed a new algorithm that can be used to evaluate measurements at X-ray free-electron lasers such as the SwissFEL more efficiently. They have now presented it in the journal Structural Dynamics.          Sometimes, when using the navigation system while traveling by car, the device will locate you off the road for a short time. This is due to the inaccuracy of the GPS positioning, which can be as much as several meters. However, the algorithm in the sat nav will soon notice this and correct the trajectory displayed on the screen, i.e. put it back on the road.A comparable principle for addressing unrealistic motion sequences has now been successfully applied by a team of researchers led by PSI physicist Cecilia Casadei. However, their objects of investigation are about a billion times smaller than a car: proteins. These building blocks of life fulfill crucial functions in all known organisms. In doing so, they often perform ultra-fast movements. Analyzing these movements precisely is crucial for our understanding of proteins which can help us produce new medical agents, among other things.How to 'film' proteinsTo further improve the understanding of protein movements, Casadei, together with other PSI researchers, a researcher at DESY in Hamburg and other colleagues at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, U.S., has developed an algorithm that evaluates data obtained in experiments at an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). An XFEL is a large-scale research facility that delivers extremely intense and short flashes of laser-quality X-ray light. Here, a method called time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (TR-SFX) can be used to study the ultra-fast movements of proteins.Credit: Paul Scherrer InstituteThe measurements are very complex for several reasons: the proteins are much too small to be imaged directly, their movements are incredibly fast, and the intense pulse of X-ray light of an FEL completely destroys the proteins. On the experimental level, TR-SFX already solves all these problems: no individual molecule is measured, but rather a large number of identical protein molecules are induced to grow together in a regular arrangement to form protein crystals.When the FEL X-ray light shines on these crystals, the information is captured in time before the crystals and their proteins are destroyed by the pulse of light. The raw data from the measurements are available as so-called diffraction images: light spots that are created by the regular arrangement of the proteins in the crystal and registered by a detector.      How to evaluate the measurement dataWhere the experimental challenges have been overcome, the evaluation of the data is just beginning. \"The measurement of each individual crystal provides only two percent of the data of a complete image.\" This incompleteness has physical and experimental reasons and can only be eliminated by combining the measurement data of many crystals in a meaningful way. Casadei's research focuses on exactly how to go about this.The method established so far is called \"binning and merging\".\"A lot has been achieved with this method in the last decade,\" says Casadei. With this method, the data are divided into time intervals and all data within one interval, a 'bin,' are averaged. However, a lot of detailed information is also lost in this averaging. \"You could say that the individual images of the protein film are then all a bit washed out,\" Casadei continues. \"That's why we have developed a method that allows us to get more out of the measurement data.\"The new method devised by Casadei and her colleagues is called \"low-pass spectral analysis\", or LPSA for short. \"Similar to electronics or audio technology, we apply a low-pass filter,\" Casadei explains. \"However, in our case it comes in the form of advanced linear algebra. We apply these formulas to remove unwanted noise from the data without losing the relevant details.\"In short and simple terms, the raw data, i.e. the diffraction images of the protein crystals, are tracked throughout the protein motion. This movement is assumed to be smooth, i.e. jerk-free. Similar to how the navigation system corrects itself when the car seemingly leaves the course of the road, the new algorithm by Casadei and her colleagues mitigates errors of the protein movement reconstruction.HDR for protein filmsLay people may not notice an immense difference in the new protein films. But for the cineastes at X-ray free-electron lasers, the improvement is comparable to switching from a DVD film to HDR quality.\"Above all, the new algorithm now allows researchers here at SwissFEL at PSI to extract more information from their data,\" says Casadei. Conversely, this means the algorithm can help shorten long measurement times. Since beam time is always in high demand at large-scale research facilities, and in particular at SwissFEL, this is a most welcome prospect for protein researchers using this highly advanced facility.

  "answer_race": " Supercooled water can be studied.",
  "question_squad": " What is the temperature range of water known as?",
  "answer_squad": " no man's land",
  "text": "Researchers at EPFL have found a way to study water in \"no man's land,\" a subzero temperature range where water crystallizes rapidly. Historically, the inability to access \"no man's land\" has prevented scientists from unriddling the anomalous nature of water, but the breakthrough method can now change that.          Water is one of the most essential and widespread compounds on Earth. Covering over 70% of the planet's surface, it has shaped its composition and geology, it regulates its climate and weather patterns, and is at the foundation of all life as we know it.But water is also weird. It exhibits a number of anomalous properties, of which scientists have identified over seventy\u2014so far. Several theories try to explain these anomalies, but verifying them experimentally is difficult. One of the reasons is that this would require studying water between 160 K and 232 K (-113 \u00b0C to -41 \u00b0C), a notorious temperature range known as \"no man's land\" where water crystallizes so fast that it has been impossible for scientists to study its properties.But why would anyone want to cool water to such low temperatures? Because when water is cooled way below its freezing point it becomes 'supercooled' with unique and fascinating properties; for example, under certain conditions it can remain in liquid form but can freeze instantly when disturbed or exposed to certain substances. Supercooled water is obtained by taking liquid water and cooling it below the freezing point while using tricks to prevent it from crystallizing or at least slowing this process down. However, even with these tricks, crystallization in 'no man's land' is still too fast.\"An experiment to systematically probe the structure of water across so-called 'no man's land' has remained elusive for decades,\" says Professor Ulrich Lorenz at EPFL's School of Basic Sciences. Now, scientists led by Lorenz have found a way to do just that. The team developed a way to rapidly prepare deeply supercooled water at a well-defined temperature and probe it with electron diffraction before it can crystallize.\"We have still not fully understood why water is an anomalous liquid, despite this topic being hotly debated for over forty years,\" says Lorenz. \"The answer appears to lie in 'no man's land.\" But because of fast crystallization, any measurement over the full temperature range has not been possible. We do this for the first time. This brings us closer to solving this long-standing mystery.\"The scientists performed the experiments with a specialized time-resolved electron microscope they custom built in their lab. They prepared the supercooled water at a well-defined temperature and probed it directly before crystallization occurred. To do this, they cooled a layer of graphene to 101 K and deposited a thin film of amorphous ice. They then locally melted the film with a microsecond laser pulse to obtain water in 'no man's land,\" and captured a diffraction pattern with an intense, high-brightness electron pulse.The researchers found that as water is cooled from room temperature to cryogenic temperatures, its structure evolves smoothly. At temperatures just below 200 K (about -73 \u00b0C), the structure of water begins to look like that of amorphous ice\u2014a form of ice where water molecules are in a disordered state\u2014unlike the tidy crystalline ice we are usually familiar with.\"The fact that the structure evolves smoothly allows us to narrow down the range of possible explanations for the origin of water anomalies,\" says Lorenz. \"Our findings and the method we have developed bring us closer to unriddling the mysteries of water. It is difficult to escape the fascination of this ubiquitous and seemingly simple liquid that still has not given up all of its secrets.\"The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.

  "text": "A study by Loughborough University and the University of Oxford has led to the development of a small molecule probe that could deepen our understanding of a crucial cellular messenger and lead to the development of new therapeutic drugs.          The research paper\u2014recently highlighted as Pick of the Week in the journal, Chemical Science\u2014showcases the researchers' innovative probe that binds to inositol pyrophosphate or '5-PP-InsP5\".5-PP-InsP5 plays a fundamental role in various biological processes, including cell growth, programmed cell death, and enzyme regulation, and new roles are still emerging with it recently being found to be a key regulator of blood glucose levels.Due to its diverse roles in cellular processes, 5-PP-InsP5 is an attractive target for developing therapeutic drugs.However, biomedical and drug discovery research relies on 'small molecule probes' to detect specific target molecules and, until now, no 5-PP-InsP5-specific probes existed.The Loughborough University and University of Oxford research team\u2014which includes Dr. Stephen Butler, Dr. Felix Plasser, and Professor Barry Potter\u2014combined their chemical synthetic and computational modeling expertise to create a probe specific to 5-PP-InsP5 that emits a bright red light upon binding.The intensity and duration of this light can be measured to quantify the levels of 5-PP-InsP5 during different biological processes, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its precise functions, mechanisms, and therapeutic potential.Of the importance of the research, Dr. Stephen Butler commented, \"A key motivation in our lab is to develop molecular tools with real-world applications, so we're excited about the potential of the probe reported here as a drug discovery tool, that could enable high-throughput screening of drug-like molecules that modulate biological processes involving the cellular messenger 5-PP-InsP5.\"Other inositol pyrophosphates exist and are still emerging in biology, so methods to detect, synthesize and exploit these could also be necessary and will be facilitated by the probe design features established in this project.\"Professor Barry Potter, of the University of Oxford, added, \"I have spent almost all of my independent scientific career in research on inositol phosphates and feel that the advent of these new pyrophosphate messengers, with their emerging biological functions, is truly exciting for the field and calls for innovation.\"Our highly collaborative new paper presents a very timely technique to measure such a messenger for the first time and should enable a wealth of further developments in the area.\"The co-lead authors of the study are Megan Shipton and Fathima Jamion, a Ph.D. and final year undergraduate student from Oxford and Loughborough, respectively.Megan and Fathima said of their achievement in a joint statement: \"We are delighted to work as part of this collaborative team to take some vital steps in helping further uncover the biological roles of 5-PP-InsP5.\"It's especially rewarding to see our combined work published in a top chemistry journal and we look forward to seeing how it fuels future research in this area.\"The research paper, titled \"Expedient synthesis and luminescence sensing of the inositol pyrophosphate cellular messenger 5-PP-InsP5,\" is Chemical Science.

The research examines the causes behind the ordering, or pattern formation, of ions that carry a positive charge, also called cations, in double perovskite oxides, a type of metal considered promising as a potential source of cleaner, more sustainable energy for its magnetism and ability to conduct electricity. The paper, titled \"Insights into Cation Ordering of Double Perovskite Oxides from Machine Learning and Causal Relations,\" is published in Chemistry of Materials.\"If we can understand the fundamental mechanism behind these properties, then we could attempt to grow or otherwise create these perovskite materials for such applications as batteries, memory devices and capacitors,\" said Ayana Ghosh, an ORNL research scientist and the study's lead author. \"We've developed a formula from this study that we'll give to the rest of the world.\"Ghosh and researchers from the SRM Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai, India, sought to determine how the patterns formed by cations affect stability in double perovskites. The more stable the material, the better suited it is for potential energy applications.\"This cation ordering can be affected by a number of variables,\" Ghosh said. \"Sizes of the ions matter. Distortions come into play. We wanted to know: Is there one single factor that would drive cation ordering in this kind of system? If so, what is that factor?\"The team relied on resources from two DOE Office of Science user facilities\u2014data collected at ORNL's Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences and time on the Cori supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center\u2014to develop a new computational framework. The system combined causal analysis and traditional machine learning with density functional theory, which estimates materials' electronic and atomic structures. Researchers trained the algorithm on various cation types and patterns within double perovskite systems to predict conditions that lead to specific ordering of cations.The team combined the cause-and-effect relationships observed with the findings from standard predictive machine learning algorithms. Analysis of the results identified trilinear coupling, an interaction among three types of particles, as the necessary condition behind clear layered ordering\u2014one of the essential patterns of cation ordering.Trilinear coupling combines three types of structural modes that push the cations through the necessary phases to result in properties such as multiferroicity, the combination of magnetization and polarization that makes perovskites promising for energy applications.\"If you have this type of coupling, you should have the formation of clear layered ordering,\" Ghosh said. \"The ordering won't occur without it. You can think of the three modes as fundamental building blocks. This wasn't known before.\"Next steps include applying those findings to identify conditions necessary for other types of ordering to design new phases of double perovskite oxides.\"This new insight gives us a road map to go beyond what we've already known from theory,\" Ghosh said. \"Now we can explore further based on these principles.\" More information:Ayana Ghosh et al, Insights into Cation Ordering of Double Perovskite Oxides from Machine Learning and Causal Relations, Chemistry of Materials (2022).

  "text": "Researchers at Flinders University have discovered a new low-cost material that can be made into lenses for thermal imaging\u2014pointing to new advanced manufacturing applications for this powerful technology.          Thermal and infrared imaging are used in many industries including defense, security and surveillance, medicine, electrical engineering, space exploration and autonomous vehicle operation\u2014but the materials required are expensive and becoming more difficult to find.Lower cost alternatives are needed so a multi-disciplinary team in chemistry and physics at Flinders University have developed a solution in an entirely new polymer material made from sulfur and cyclopentadiene. They say the high-performance polymers have the unique ability to transmit infrared light.\"The material combines high performance, low cost and efficient manufacturing,\" says Ph.D. candidate Sam Tonkin, first author in a new article in the Advanced Optical Materials journal.\"It has the potential to expand the use of thermal imaging to new industries which were previously limited by the high cost of germanium or chalcogenide lenses. This is a rapidly developing field which will see exciting advances in the next few years,\" he says.Sulfur is produced in many millions of tons in petroleum refining. Billions of tons are available in geological deposits. It is plentiful and cheap.Cyclopentadiene is also derived from low-cost materials produced in petroleum refining.The lenses used for thermal imaging are currently made from germanium or chalcogenide glasses. Germanium is an element in short supply and it is very expensive. Some germanium lenses can costs thousands of dollars.Chalcogenide glasses also have shortcomings. For instance, they are often made of toxic elements such as arsenic or selenium.Co-author Dr. Le Nhan Pham, a Flinders University researcher in computational and physical chemistry, says reacting sulfur and cyclopentadiene together provides a black plastic with high transparency to infrared light.\"This is the light that is detected by thermal imaging cameras.\"This novel material was designed to have a wide array of potential applications from space engineering to military operation, and to civil and aerospace industries,\" he says.The polymer can be molded into a variety of lenses, which can be used, for example, to magnify the image in a thermal camera. Because the polymer is black, it can also be used to conceal and protect thermal imaging equipment. The polymer can therefore be used as camouflage to hide a camera used for surveillance.The infrared light passes through the polymer, so one can see through it using an infrared camera. This property is useful for defense operations and wildlife surveillance.The polymer also has many other features:The material has the highest long-wave infrared light transparency ever reported for a plastic.The raw materials are low cost: for a 1 g lens the building blocks cost less than 1 cent.The material allows rapid molding into various shapes such as lenses. This is a more rapid process than current lens production which relies on slow milling methods.The study also reported some key scientific advances, including a new reactor that was designed to enable the key reaction. A key challenge was to be able to use the building blocks in gaseous form. The use of gaseous monomers was previous thought not to be possible by other researchers in the area.The study also includes quantum mechanical calculations to understand how and why the material is transparent to infrared light used in thermal imaging. These insights will also be useful in the future to design new lenses with further improved properties. More information:Samuel J.

  "answer_squad": " consuming fish with elevated mercury concentrations",
  "text": "A new study at Ume\u00e5 University provides insight into how mercury transforms into its more toxic form, methylmercury, with the help of small sulfur-containing substances known as thiols.          Mercury spread in the environment is a critical issue, due to the severe effects on human health and ecosystems. The main mercury exposure for humans comes from consuming fish with elevated mercury concentrations, especially in the form of methylmercury. Most of the methylmercury in the environment is formed by specific microorganisms by transforming mercury.Mareike Gutensohn, at the Department of Chemistry at Ume\u00e5 University, has explored how small sulfur-containing substances, called thiols, influence this transformation. Thiols can be found dissolved in oxygen-free waters or within the surface of cells, as part of proteins, and they play a critical role in forming methylmercury since they can attach to mercury and affect how easily it is transformed or absorbed by microorganisms.Monitoring the environment is importantIn her thesis, she has investigated systematically the combined effect of chemical and biological factors on the formation of methylmercury and the mechanistic behind it. The study unveiled that the formation of dissolved thiols, tied to cell metabolism, leads to enhanced production of methylmercury.\"The formation of both thiols and methylmercury heavily depends on the metabolic activity of microorganisms. Interestingly, the composition and concentration of the formed thiols significantly impact the potential for methylmercury formation. This underlines the importance of monitoring the formation of thiols within the environment,\" says Mareike Gutensohn, doctoral student at the Department of Chemistry.The research also provided the first systematic characterization of the outer and inner cell membranes of the studied microorganism, with respect to thiols within the surface of the cells. For this, Mareike Gutensohn used advanced spectroscopic techniques known as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a powerful method to study cell-mercury interaction.Complex relationshipThe characterization unveiled variations in thiol concentration across the cell membrane, shedding light on the complex relationship between thiols and mercury transformation.\"While our understanding of thiols' role in methylmercury formation has significantly improved, there's still much to explore, particularly the role and implications of the differences in thiol concentration within the cell surface,\" says Mareike Gutensohn.This study advances our understanding of the complex interplay of chemical and biological factors impacting mercury's transformation into methylmercury. This breakthrough in scientific understanding helps predict and control methylmercury formation, contributing to a safer and healthier ecosystem.

  "text": "What makes for the ultimate beer drinking experience? Some like theirs in a frosty glass, others with a wedge of lime. But when it comes to froth\u2014or the head as it's commonly known\u2014what's the best amount and how can it be achieved?          Too much froth and you're left with a smear of bubbles across your face and hanging from your nose as you desperately try to get at the beer beneath. But too little will cause problems in your stomach.You see, if there's no foam the CO2 stays dissolved in the beer. If you then eat something, the foam erupts in your stomach rather than the glass, causing beer bloat. That's why tipping a glass to avoid a frothy head is a rookie error.Hoping to solve this issue, a company in Japan has designed a beer can with two pulls, which control the level of foam produced by opening the can, resulting in the perfect amount of froth.This is just the most recent development in beer technology. Humanity has been chasing the perfect pint since beer's inception, which evidence suggests was roughly 13,000 years ago near Haifa, Israel\u2014the oldest known record of human-made alcohol.Under pressureBeer consumption has evolved through the ages.Those first producers and consumers of beer in Israel were the Natufian people, a group of hunter-gatherers in the eastern Mediterranean. Their beer would have been unfiltered, which made it look like thin porridge.This led to the invention of beer straws around the fifth to the fourth millennium in Iran and Iraq, which featured a filter on the tip that held back the beer solids. These straws were similar in design to a modern bombilla (a yerba mate tea straw used for at least four centuries in South America).The next significant leap in brewing was not the glass bottle, but another airtight closure: the barrel.Advances in cooperage (the making of wooden casks and barrels) during the Middle Ages meant that the CO2 produced by yeast during fermentation remained in the solution within the container, rather than dissipating and giving it the porridge-like consistency of previous beers. This meant beer could be held and dispensed under pressure for the first time. This inexorably altered the appearance and flavor of beer, as it became effervescent and foamy when served fresh.Foam was a vital component of proper beer because it showed its freshness.A good headThe foamy head was at one time called a \"collar\"\u2014a term that first appeared in print in John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row. There seems to be no origin story attached to the moniker. And sadly, there seems less need to apply a name to beer foam since society has strayed from proper beer pouring techniques.Traditionally, beer was allowed to foam up so much as it was being poured that a \"foam scraper\" (also known as a \"foam flipper\" or \"head cutter\") was needed to shave the excess off the glass rim. A large head was achieved by pouring the beer in an upright glass and encouraging excessive foaming. This technique dissipates the trapped CO2 and brings positive flavor elements to the forefront.These days you'll notice that glasses are tipped while beer is poured. This is done to minimize foam but leads to a less pleasurable, gaseous experience instead of a creamy, toasty sip.Next time you order a pint you should ask your bartender to pour the amber stuff into an upright glass. This is all to say, don't fear the foam, it's integral to your enjoyment. Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

  "question_squad": " What is the market value of formaldehyde?",
  "answer_squad": " USD 8 billion",
  "text": "In a concerted effort with collaborators from the University College London, Professor Zhengxiao Guo from the Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong (HKU), and Professor Junwang Tang, now at the Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, have jointly developed a highly active and selective catalytic material that can efficiently convert methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into formaldehyde, an essential chemical in a waste-free manner.          This innovative material, derived from tungsten trioxide (WO3 catalyst), features a dual active site comprising copper and tungsten atomic species that work in tandem to ensure an effective and selective conversion process. The conversion process can achieve nearly 100% selectivity under visible light, which avoids unwanted byproducts and increase efficiency, making it an eco-friendly alternative to current production methods. The findings have just been published in the journal Nature Communications.Change the unchanged: Methane conversionMethane, the principal component of natural gas, is a widely used carbon source for numerous chemicals. Nevertheless, it is also a potent greenhouse gas, with more than 70 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. The catalytic conversion of methane (converting methane into other chemicals), therefore, presents a tremendous opportunity for achieving net-zero energy and chemical supplies while simultaneously addressing environmental concerns.However, methane is an extremely stable molecule, making it resistant to activation, particularly under mild or ambient conditions. Thus, achieving high activity and selectivity in methane conversion is a significant challenge, and the selective activation of the intermolecular carbon-hydrogen bond is often considered by many chemists as one of the most elusive \"holy grails\" in catalysis.Formaldehyde, on the other hand, is a high-volume commodity chemical with a market value of USD 8 billion, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7%. It is used in household, commercial, aviation, medical and automotive products and serves as a valuable precursor for melamine, urea-formaldehyde and phenolic resins, among others. Formaldehyde is also safely used in the manufacture of vaccines, anti-infective drugs and hard-gel capsules. Currently, it is produced through methanol oxidation-dehydrogenation using silver or metal-oxide catalysts at high reactor temperatures of more than 500\u00b0C\u2013600\u00b0C, resulting in substantial carbon dioxide emissions and energy penalties.      Harnessing sunlight to convert methaneIn their study, the team discovers a new way of turning methane gas into formaldehyde using sunlight. They found that a mixture of atomically dispersed copper and partially reduced tungsten species over tungsten oxide worked really well\u2014the synergistic ensemble enabling exceptional photocatalytic methane conversion to formaldehyde under ambient visible light. The process exhibited nearly 100% selectivity and high conversion efficiency, significantly outperforming previously reported photocatalysts (with a turnover frequency, TOF = 8.5\u00d7106 \u03bcmol (HCHO)\u00b7g-1(cocatalyst)\u00b7h-1).Through mechanistic analysis, they figured out that the copper helped to move electrons around and create reactive molecular species while the tungsten helped to activate the methane gas. Specifically, the copper acted as electron acceptors and promoted photo-induced electron transfer from the conduction band to dioxygen, generating reactive hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO\u00b7). Meanwhile, the adjacent tungsten atom that had a partial positive charge functioned as hole acceptors. The preferred adsorption and activation site of water produced hydroxyl radicals and effectively activated methane to methyl radicals. The synergy of the adjacent dual active sites greatly enhances the overall efficiency and selectivity of the conversion process.This finding paves the way for further research and development of new photo-catalysts for a variety of chemical conversions, promoting more sustainable and efficient processes in the chemical industry.\"Solar conversion of methane is highly desirable for both low-carbon and high-value-added chemical syntheses. However, product selectivity and production efficiency are key to success. This requires an in-depth understanding of the conversion mechanism, careful design of the catalyst, and complementary techniques to confirm its performance\u2014a good case of multidisciplinary tasks that require strong collaborative dedication. That's exactly what the team has managed to do\u2014with much value-added outcome,\" said Professor Zhengxiao Guo, one of the corresponding authors of the paper.

  "text": "While it can take years for the pharmaceutical industry to create medicines capable of treating or curing human disease, a new study suggests that using generative artificial intelligence could vastly accelerate the drug-development process.          Today, most drug discovery is carried out by human chemists who rely on their knowledge and experience to select and synthesize the right molecules needed to become the safe and efficient medicines we depend on. To identify the synthesis paths, scientists often employ a technique called retrosynthesis\u2014a method for creating potential drugs by working backward from the wanted molecules and searching for chemical reactions to make them.Yet because sifting through millions of potential chemical reactions can be an extremely challenging and time-consuming endeavor, researchers at The Ohio State University have created an AI framework called G2Retro to automatically generate reactions for any given molecule. The new study showed that compared to current manual-planning methods, the framework was able to cover an enormous range of possible chemical reactions as well as accurately and quickly discern which reactions might work best to create a given drug molecule.\"Using AI for things critical to saving human lives, such as medicine, is what we really want to focus on,\" said Xia Ning, lead author of the study and an associate professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State. \"Our aim was to use AI to accelerate the drug design process, and we found that it not only saves researchers time and money but provides drug candidates that may have much better properties than any molecules that exist in nature.\"This study builds on previous research of Ning's where her team developed a method named Modof that was able to generate molecule structures that exhibited desired properties better than any existing molecules. \"Now the question becomes how to make such generated molecules, and that is where this new study shines,\" said Ning, also an associate professor of biomedical informatics in the College of Medicine.The study was published today in the journal Communications Chemistry.Ning's team trained G2Retro on a dataset that contains 40,000 chemical reactions collected between 1976 and 2016. The framework \"learns\" from graph-based representations of given molecules, and uses deep neural networks to generate possible reactant structures that could be used to synthesize them. Its generative power is so impressive that, according to Ning, once given a molecule, G2Retro could come up with hundreds of new reaction predictions in only a few minutes.\"Our generative AI method G2Retro is able to supply multiple different synthesis routes and options, as well as a way to rank different options for each molecule,\" said Ning. \"This is not going to replace current lab-based experiments, but it will offer more and better drug options so experiments can be prioritized and focused much faster.\"To further test the AI's effectiveness, Ning's team conducted a case study to see if G2Retro could accurately predict four newly released drugs already in circulation: Mitapivat, a medication used to treat hemolytic anemia; Tapinarof, which is used to treat various skin diseases; Mavacamten, a drug to treat systemic heart failure; and Oteseconazole, used to treat fungal infections in females. G2Retro was able to correctly generate exactly the same patented synthesis routes for these medicines, and provided alternative synthesis routes that are also feasible and synthetically useful, Ning said.Having such a dynamic and effective device at scientists' disposal could enable the industry to manufacture stronger drugs at a quicker pace\u2014but despite the edge AI might give scientists inside the lab, Ning emphasizes the medicines G2Retro or any generative AI creates still need to be validated\u2014a process that involves the created molecules being tested in animal models and later in human trials.\"We are very excited about generative AI for medicine, and we are dedicated to using AI responsibly to improve human health,\" said Ning.

  "answer_squad": " GPCRs",
  "text": "An international study led by Monash University has, for the first time, harnessed cutting-edge technology to reveal new and unprecedented information of how a special class of drugs, known as \"allosteric modulators\" work at the M4 muscarinic receptor, a major target for notoriously difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive deficits, such as schizophrenia.          Muscarinic receptors are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)\u2014the largest drug target class encoded by the human genome. The M4 muscarinic receptor subtype, in particular, plays a vital role in regulating neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and glutamate, in key areas of the brain involved in psychosis and cognition, but, until recently, was notoriously difficult to selectively target by conventional agonists or antagonists.This challenge has begun to be addressed in recent years with the discovery of highly selective allosteric modulators for this receptor, but how such drugs achieve their selectivity and regulate M4 receptor activity in response to different activators has remained a major, elusive, knowledge gap, despite high clinical implications.The new study, published in eLife, and led by a team of researchers from the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (MIPS), has now addressed this important gap in our molecular-level understanding of how allosteric modulators mediate their effects at the M4 muscarinic receptor.In this study, the MIPS researchers (who are world-leaders in the discovery and development of next-generation neuromedicines, including allosteric modulators, for difficult-to-treat mental illnesses), rigorously quantified the pharmacological properties of two distinct 'positive' allosteric modulators, alone or in combination with two different agonists, at the human M4 muscarinic receptor.The team also tapped into technological advancements in the fields of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics simulations to unlock first-of-its-kind evidence of key molecular mechanisms underlying allosteric pharmacology, advancing our understanding of the structural basis of allosteric modulation of the M4 muscarinic receptor and paving the way for the discovery and design of future allosteric drugs.      In particular, the researchers revealed a vital role for ligand\u2013receptor\u2013G protein complex stability, mediated by conformational dynamics between these sites, in the ultimate determination of affinity, efficacy, degree of allosteric modulation, and mechanisms underlying species variability of allosteric drugs, all of which have significant implications for preclinical-to-clinical discovery and translation of such agents.Corresponding author, and MIPS Senior Research Fellow, Dr. David Thal, said that allosteric modulation of GPCRs is a major paradigm in drug discovery; however, despite decades of research, a molecular-level understanding of the general principles that govern the myriad pharmacological effects exerted by GPCR allosteric modulators has remained elusive.\"By determining the cryo-EM structures of the M4 muscarinic receptor and applying molecular dynamics simulations, the team has provided a holistic framework for further GPCR mechanistic studies and, in turn, opened up new approaches for GPCR drug discovery,\" said Dr. Thal.Professor Arthur Christopoulos, FAA FAHMS, also a corresponding author on the study, Dean of the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Director of Monash's Neuromedicines Discovery Centre, said the results have broader implications for the development of new allosteric medicines designed to reduce currently untreated symptoms associated with schizophrenia and cognitive disorders.\"The vast majority of patients with schizophrenia have impaired cognition, which is untreated by any existing antipsychotic drug, and its severity remains a major predictor of prognosis. However the development of new safe and effective treatments has remained stagnant for decades,\" said Professor Christopoulos.\"The research conducted in this study is a vital step toward progressing the next generation of medical therapies and innovations that could make a true impact when it comes to improving health and saving lives.\"Dr. Celine Valant, also a corresponding author and Senior Research Fellow at MIPS, said the findings open up exciting new opportunities.\"The evidence presented in this study will enable future GPCR drug discovery research and potentially lead to the development of next generation medicines for the treatment of a range of psychiatric and cognitive disorders,\" said Dr. Valant.

  "text": "Proteins are biological molecules that perform almost all biochemical tasks in all forms of life. In doing so, the tiny structures perform ultra-fast movements. In order to investigate these dynamic processes more precisely than before, researchers have developed a new algorithm that can be used to evaluate measurements at X-ray free-electron lasers such as the SwissFEL more efficiently. They have now presented it in the journal Structural Dynamics.          Sometimes, when using the navigation system while traveling by car, the device will locate you off the road for a short time. This is due to the inaccuracy of the GPS positioning, which can be as much as several meters. However, the algorithm in the sat nav will soon notice this and correct the trajectory displayed on the screen, i.e. put it back on the road.A comparable principle for addressing unrealistic motion sequences has now been successfully applied by a team of researchers led by PSI physicist Cecilia Casadei. However, their objects of investigation are about a billion times smaller than a car: proteins. These building blocks of life fulfill crucial functions in all known organisms. In doing so, they often perform ultra-fast movements. Analyzing these movements precisely is crucial for our understanding of proteins which can help us produce new medical agents, among other things.How to 'film' proteinsTo further improve the understanding of protein movements, Casadei, together with other PSI researchers, a researcher at DESY in Hamburg and other colleagues at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, U.S., has developed an algorithm that evaluates data obtained in experiments at an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). An XFEL is a large-scale research facility that delivers extremely intense and short flashes of laser-quality X-ray light. Here, a method called time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (TR-SFX) can be used to study the ultra-fast movements of proteins.Credit: Paul Scherrer InstituteThe measurements are very complex for several reasons: the proteins are much too small to be imaged directly, their movements are incredibly fast, and the intense pulse of X-ray light of an FEL completely destroys the proteins. On the experimental level, TR-SFX already solves all these problems: no individual molecule is measured, but rather a large number of identical protein molecules are induced to grow together in a regular arrangement to form protein crystals.When the FEL X-ray light shines on these crystals, the information is captured in time before the crystals and their proteins are destroyed by the pulse of light. The raw data from the measurements are available as so-called diffraction images: light spots that are created by the regular arrangement of the proteins in the crystal and registered by a detector.      How to evaluate the measurement dataWhere the experimental challenges have been overcome, the evaluation of the data is just beginning. \"The measurement of each individual crystal provides only two percent of the data of a complete image.\" This incompleteness has physical and experimental reasons and can only be eliminated by combining the measurement data of many crystals in a meaningful way. Casadei's research focuses on exactly how to go about this.The method established so far is called \"binning and merging\".\"A lot has been achieved with this method in the last decade,\" says Casadei. With this method, the data are divided into time intervals and all data within one interval, a 'bin,' are averaged. However, a lot of detailed information is also lost in this averaging. \"You could say that the individual images of the protein film are then all a bit washed out,\" Casadei continues. \"That's why we have developed a method that allows us to get more out of the measurement data.\"The new method devised by Casadei and her colleagues is called \"low-pass spectral analysis\", or LPSA for short. \"Similar to electronics or audio technology, we apply a low-pass filter,\" Casadei explains. \"However, in our case it comes in the form of advanced linear algebra. We apply these formulas to remove unwanted noise from the data without losing the relevant details.\"In short and simple terms, the raw data, i.e. the diffraction images of the protein crystals, are tracked throughout the protein motion. This movement is assumed to be smooth, i.e. jerk-free. Similar to how the navigation system corrects itself when the car seemingly leaves the course of the road, the new algorithm by Casadei and her colleagues mitigates errors of the protein movement reconstruction.HDR for protein filmsLay people may not notice an immense difference in the new protein films. But for the cineastes at X-ray free-electron lasers, the improvement is comparable to switching from a DVD film to HDR quality.\"Above all, the new algorithm now allows researchers here at SwissFEL at PSI to extract more information from their data,\" says Casadei. Conversely, this means the algorithm can help shorten long measurement times. Since beam time is always in high demand at large-scale research facilities, and in particular at SwissFEL, this is a most welcome prospect for protein researchers using this highly advanced facility.

  "answer_race": " Supercooled water can be studied.",
  "question_squad": " What is the temperature range of water known as?",
  "answer_squad": " no man's land",
  "text": "Researchers at EPFL have found a way to study water in \"no man's land,\" a subzero temperature range where water crystallizes rapidly. Historically, the inability to access \"no man's land\" has prevented scientists from unriddling the anomalous nature of water, but the breakthrough method can now change that.          Water is one of the most essential and widespread compounds on Earth. Covering over 70% of the planet's surface, it has shaped its composition and geology, it regulates its climate and weather patterns, and is at the foundation of all life as we know it.But water is also weird. It exhibits a number of anomalous properties, of which scientists have identified over seventy\u2014so far. Several theories try to explain these anomalies, but verifying them experimentally is difficult. One of the reasons is that this would require studying water between 160 K and 232 K (-113 \u00b0C to -41 \u00b0C), a notorious temperature range known as \"no man's land\" where water crystallizes so fast that it has been impossible for scientists to study its properties.But why would anyone want to cool water to such low temperatures? Because when water is cooled way below its freezing point it becomes 'supercooled' with unique and fascinating properties; for example, under certain conditions it can remain in liquid form but can freeze instantly when disturbed or exposed to certain substances. Supercooled water is obtained by taking liquid water and cooling it below the freezing point while using tricks to prevent it from crystallizing or at least slowing this process down. However, even with these tricks, crystallization in 'no man's land' is still too fast.\"An experiment to systematically probe the structure of water across so-called 'no man's land' has remained elusive for decades,\" says Professor Ulrich Lorenz at EPFL's School of Basic Sciences. Now, scientists led by Lorenz have found a way to do just that. The team developed a way to rapidly prepare deeply supercooled water at a well-defined temperature and probe it with electron diffraction before it can crystallize.\"We have still not fully understood why water is an anomalous liquid, despite this topic being hotly debated for over forty years,\" says Lorenz. \"The answer appears to lie in 'no man's land.\" But because of fast crystallization, any measurement over the full temperature range has not been possible. We do this for the first time. This brings us closer to solving this long-standing mystery.\"The scientists performed the experiments with a specialized time-resolved electron microscope they custom built in their lab. They prepared the supercooled water at a well-defined temperature and probed it directly before crystallization occurred. To do this, they cooled a layer of graphene to 101 K and deposited a thin film of amorphous ice. They then locally melted the film with a microsecond laser pulse to obtain water in 'no man's land,\" and captured a diffraction pattern with an intense, high-brightness electron pulse.The researchers found that as water is cooled from room temperature to cryogenic temperatures, its structure evolves smoothly. At temperatures just below 200 K (about -73 \u00b0C), the structure of water begins to look like that of amorphous ice\u2014a form of ice where water molecules are in a disordered state\u2014unlike the tidy crystalline ice we are usually familiar with.\"The fact that the structure evolves smoothly allows us to narrow down the range of possible explanations for the origin of water anomalies,\" says Lorenz. \"Our findings and the method we have developed bring us closer to unriddling the mysteries of water. It is difficult to escape the fascination of this ubiquitous and seemingly simple liquid that still has not given up all of its secrets.\"The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.

The research paper\u2014recently highlighted as Pick of the Week in the journal, Chemical Science\u2014showcases the researchers' innovative probe that binds to inositol pyrophosphate or '5-PP-InsP5\".5-PP-InsP5 plays a fundamental role in various biological processes, including cell growth, programmed cell death, and enzyme regulation, and new roles are still emerging with it recently being found to be a key regulator of blood glucose levels.Due to its diverse roles in cellular processes, 5-PP-InsP5 is an attractive target for developing therapeutic drugs.However, biomedical and drug discovery research relies on 'small molecule probes' to detect specific target molecules and, until now, no 5-PP-InsP5-specific probes existed.The Loughborough University and University of Oxford research team\u2014which includes Dr. Stephen Butler, Dr. Felix Plasser, and Professor Barry Potter\u2014combined their chemical synthetic and computational modeling expertise to create a probe specific to 5-PP-InsP5 that emits a bright red light upon binding.The intensity and duration of this light can be measured to quantify the levels of 5-PP-InsP5 during different biological processes, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its precise functions, mechanisms, and therapeutic potential.Of the importance of the research, Dr. Stephen Butler commented, \"A key motivation in our lab is to develop molecular tools with real-world applications, so we're excited about the potential of the probe reported here as a drug discovery tool, that could enable high-throughput screening of drug-like molecules that modulate biological processes involving the cellular messenger 5-PP-InsP5.\"Other inositol pyrophosphates exist and are still emerging in biology, so methods to detect, synthesize and exploit these could also be necessary and will be facilitated by the probe design features established in this project.\"Professor Barry Potter, of the University of Oxford, added, \"I have spent almost all of my independent scientific career in research on inositol phosphates and feel that the advent of these new pyrophosphate messengers, with their emerging biological functions, is truly exciting for the field and calls for innovation.\"Our highly collaborative new paper presents a very timely technique to measure such a messenger for the first time and should enable a wealth of further developments in the area.\"The co-lead authors of the study are Megan Shipton and Fathima Jamion, a Ph.D. and final year undergraduate student from Oxford and Loughborough, respectively.Megan and Fathima said of their achievement in a joint statement: \"We are delighted to work as part of this collaborative team to take some vital steps in helping further uncover the biological roles of 5-PP-InsP5.\"It's especially rewarding to see our combined work published in a top chemistry journal and we look forward to seeing how it fuels future research in this area.\"The research paper, titled \"Expedient synthesis and luminescence sensing of the inositol pyrophosphate cellular messenger 5-PP-InsP5,\" is Chemical Science.

The research examines the causes behind the ordering, or pattern formation, of ions that carry a positive charge, also called cations, in double perovskite oxides, a type of metal considered promising as a potential source of cleaner, more sustainable energy for its magnetism and ability to conduct electricity. The paper, titled \"Insights into Cation Ordering of Double Perovskite Oxides from Machine Learning and Causal Relations,\" is published in Chemistry of Materials.\"If we can understand the fundamental mechanism behind these properties, then we could attempt to grow or otherwise create these perovskite materials for such applications as batteries, memory devices and capacitors,\" said Ayana Ghosh, an ORNL research scientist and the study's lead author. \"We've developed a formula from this study that we'll give to the rest of the world.\"Ghosh and researchers from the SRM Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai, India, sought to determine how the patterns formed by cations affect stability in double perovskites. The more stable the material, the better suited it is for potential energy applications.\"This cation ordering can be affected by a number of variables,\" Ghosh said. \"Sizes of the ions matter. Distortions come into play. We wanted to know: Is there one single factor that would drive cation ordering in this kind of system? If so, what is that factor?\"The team relied on resources from two DOE Office of Science user facilities\u2014data collected at ORNL's Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences and time on the Cori supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center\u2014to develop a new computational framework. The system combined causal analysis and traditional machine learning with density functional theory, which estimates materials' electronic and atomic structures. Researchers trained the algorithm on various cation types and patterns within double perovskite systems to predict conditions that lead to specific ordering of cations.The team combined the cause-and-effect relationships observed with the findings from standard predictive machine learning algorithms. Analysis of the results identified trilinear coupling, an interaction among three types of particles, as the necessary condition behind clear layered ordering\u2014one of the essential patterns of cation ordering.Trilinear coupling combines three types of structural modes that push the cations through the necessary phases to result in properties such as multiferroicity, the combination of magnetization and polarization that makes perovskites promising for energy applications.\"If you have this type of coupling, you should have the formation of clear layered ordering,\" Ghosh said. \"The ordering won't occur without it. You can think of the three modes as fundamental building blocks. This wasn't known before.\"Next steps include applying those findings to identify conditions necessary for other types of ordering to design new phases of double perovskite oxides.\"This new insight gives us a road map to go beyond what we've already known from theory,\" Ghosh said. \"Now we can explore further based on these principles.\" More information:Ayana Ghosh et al, Insights into Cation Ordering of Double Perovskite Oxides from Machine Learning and Causal Relations, Chemistry of Materials (2022).

  "text": "Researchers at Flinders University have discovered a new low-cost material that can be made into lenses for thermal imaging\u2014pointing to new advanced manufacturing applications for this powerful technology.          Thermal and infrared imaging are used in many industries including defense, security and surveillance, medicine, electrical engineering, space exploration and autonomous vehicle operation\u2014but the materials required are expensive and becoming more difficult to find.Lower cost alternatives are needed so a multi-disciplinary team in chemistry and physics at Flinders University have developed a solution in an entirely new polymer material made from sulfur and cyclopentadiene. They say the high-performance polymers have the unique ability to transmit infrared light.\"The material combines high performance, low cost and efficient manufacturing,\" says Ph.D. candidate Sam Tonkin, first author in a new article in the Advanced Optical Materials journal.\"It has the potential to expand the use of thermal imaging to new industries which were previously limited by the high cost of germanium or chalcogenide lenses. This is a rapidly developing field which will see exciting advances in the next few years,\" he says.Sulfur is produced in many millions of tons in petroleum refining. Billions of tons are available in geological deposits. It is plentiful and cheap.Cyclopentadiene is also derived from low-cost materials produced in petroleum refining.The lenses used for thermal imaging are currently made from germanium or chalcogenide glasses. Germanium is an element in short supply and it is very expensive. Some germanium lenses can costs thousands of dollars.Chalcogenide glasses also have shortcomings. For instance, they are often made of toxic elements such as arsenic or selenium.Co-author Dr. Le Nhan Pham, a Flinders University researcher in computational and physical chemistry, says reacting sulfur and cyclopentadiene together provides a black plastic with high transparency to infrared light.\"This is the light that is detected by thermal imaging cameras.\"This novel material was designed to have a wide array of potential applications from space engineering to military operation, and to civil and aerospace industries,\" he says.The polymer can be molded into a variety of lenses, which can be used, for example, to magnify the image in a thermal camera. Because the polymer is black, it can also be used to conceal and protect thermal imaging equipment. The polymer can therefore be used as camouflage to hide a camera used for surveillance.The infrared light passes through the polymer, so one can see through it using an infrared camera. This property is useful for defense operations and wildlife surveillance.The polymer also has many other features:The material has the highest long-wave infrared light transparency ever reported for a plastic.The raw materials are low cost: for a 1 g lens the building blocks cost less than 1 cent.The material allows rapid molding into various shapes such as lenses. This is a more rapid process than current lens production which relies on slow milling methods.The study also reported some key scientific advances, including a new reactor that was designed to enable the key reaction. A key challenge was to be able to use the building blocks in gaseous form. The use of gaseous monomers was previous thought not to be possible by other researchers in the area.The study also includes quantum mechanical calculations to understand how and why the material is transparent to infrared light used in thermal imaging. These insights will also be useful in the future to design new lenses with further improved properties. More information:Samuel J.

  "text": "A new study at Ume\u00e5 University provides insight into how mercury transforms into its more toxic form, methylmercury, with the help of small sulfur-containing substances known as thiols.          Mercury spread in the environment is a critical issue, due to the severe effects on human health and ecosystems. The main mercury exposure for humans comes from consuming fish with elevated mercury concentrations, especially in the form of methylmercury. Most of the methylmercury in the environment is formed by specific microorganisms by transforming mercury.Mareike Gutensohn, at the Department of Chemistry at Ume\u00e5 University, has explored how small sulfur-containing substances, called thiols, influence this transformation. Thiols can be found dissolved in oxygen-free waters or within the surface of cells, as part of proteins, and they play a critical role in forming methylmercury since they can attach to mercury and affect how easily it is transformed or absorbed by microorganisms.Monitoring the environment is importantIn her thesis, she has investigated systematically the combined effect of chemical and biological factors on the formation of methylmercury and the mechanistic behind it. The study unveiled that the formation of dissolved thiols, tied to cell metabolism, leads to enhanced production of methylmercury.\"The formation of both thiols and methylmercury heavily depends on the metabolic activity of microorganisms. Interestingly, the composition and concentration of the formed thiols significantly impact the potential for methylmercury formation. This underlines the importance of monitoring the formation of thiols within the environment,\" says Mareike Gutensohn, doctoral student at the Department of Chemistry.The research also provided the first systematic characterization of the outer and inner cell membranes of the studied microorganism, with respect to thiols within the surface of the cells. For this, Mareike Gutensohn used advanced spectroscopic techniques known as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a powerful method to study cell-mercury interaction.Complex relationshipThe characterization unveiled variations in thiol concentration across the cell membrane, shedding light on the complex relationship between thiols and mercury transformation.\"While our understanding of thiols' role in methylmercury formation has significantly improved, there's still much to explore, particularly the role and implications of the differences in thiol concentration within the cell surface,\" says Mareike Gutensohn.This study advances our understanding of the complex interplay of chemical and biological factors impacting mercury's transformation into methylmercury. This breakthrough in scientific understanding helps predict and control methylmercury formation, contributing to a safer and healthier ecosystem.

  "text": "What makes for the ultimate beer drinking experience? Some like theirs in a frosty glass, others with a wedge of lime. But when it comes to froth\u2014or the head as it's commonly known\u2014what's the best amount and how can it be achieved?          Too much froth and you're left with a smear of bubbles across your face and hanging from your nose as you desperately try to get at the beer beneath. But too little will cause problems in your stomach.You see, if there's no foam the CO2 stays dissolved in the beer. If you then eat something, the foam erupts in your stomach rather than the glass, causing beer bloat. That's why tipping a glass to avoid a frothy head is a rookie error.Hoping to solve this issue, a company in Japan has designed a beer can with two pulls, which control the level of foam produced by opening the can, resulting in the perfect amount of froth.This is just the most recent development in beer technology. Humanity has been chasing the perfect pint since beer's inception, which evidence suggests was roughly 13,000 years ago near Haifa, Israel\u2014the oldest known record of human-made alcohol.Under pressureBeer consumption has evolved through the ages.Those first producers and consumers of beer in Israel were the Natufian people, a group of hunter-gatherers in the eastern Mediterranean. Their beer would have been unfiltered, which made it look like thin porridge.This led to the invention of beer straws around the fifth to the fourth millennium in Iran and Iraq, which featured a filter on the tip that held back the beer solids. These straws were similar in design to a modern bombilla (a yerba mate tea straw used for at least four centuries in South America).The next significant leap in brewing was not the glass bottle, but another airtight closure: the barrel.Advances in cooperage (the making of wooden casks and barrels) during the Middle Ages meant that the CO2 produced by yeast during fermentation remained in the solution within the container, rather than dissipating and giving it the porridge-like consistency of previous beers. This meant beer could be held and dispensed under pressure for the first time. This inexorably altered the appearance and flavor of beer, as it became effervescent and foamy when served fresh.Foam was a vital component of proper beer because it showed its freshness.A good headThe foamy head was at one time called a \"collar\"\u2014a term that first appeared in print in John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row. There seems to be no origin story attached to the moniker. And sadly, there seems less need to apply a name to beer foam since society has strayed from proper beer pouring techniques.Traditionally, beer was allowed to foam up so much as it was being poured that a \"foam scraper\" (also known as a \"foam flipper\" or \"head cutter\") was needed to shave the excess off the glass rim. A large head was achieved by pouring the beer in an upright glass and encouraging excessive foaming. This technique dissipates the trapped CO2 and brings positive flavor elements to the forefront.These days you'll notice that glasses are tipped while beer is poured. This is done to minimize foam but leads to a less pleasurable, gaseous experience instead of a creamy, toasty sip.Next time you order a pint you should ask your bartender to pour the amber stuff into an upright glass. This is all to say, don't fear the foam, it's integral to your enjoyment. Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

  "answer_squad": " USD 8 billion",
  "text": "In a concerted effort with collaborators from the University College London, Professor Zhengxiao Guo from the Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong (HKU), and Professor Junwang Tang, now at the Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, have jointly developed a highly active and selective catalytic material that can efficiently convert methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into formaldehyde, an essential chemical in a waste-free manner.          This innovative material, derived from tungsten trioxide (WO3 catalyst), features a dual active site comprising copper and tungsten atomic species that work in tandem to ensure an effective and selective conversion process. The conversion process can achieve nearly 100% selectivity under visible light, which avoids unwanted byproducts and increase efficiency, making it an eco-friendly alternative to current production methods. The findings have just been published in the journal Nature Communications.Change the unchanged: Methane conversionMethane, the principal component of natural gas, is a widely used carbon source for numerous chemicals. Nevertheless, it is also a potent greenhouse gas, with more than 70 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. The catalytic conversion of methane (converting methane into other chemicals), therefore, presents a tremendous opportunity for achieving net-zero energy and chemical supplies while simultaneously addressing environmental concerns.However, methane is an extremely stable molecule, making it resistant to activation, particularly under mild or ambient conditions. Thus, achieving high activity and selectivity in methane conversion is a significant challenge, and the selective activation of the intermolecular carbon-hydrogen bond is often considered by many chemists as one of the most elusive \"holy grails\" in catalysis.Formaldehyde, on the other hand, is a high-volume commodity chemical with a market value of USD 8 billion, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7%. It is used in household, commercial, aviation, medical and automotive products and serves as a valuable precursor for melamine, urea-formaldehyde and phenolic resins, among others. Formaldehyde is also safely used in the manufacture of vaccines, anti-infective drugs and hard-gel capsules. Currently, it is produced through methanol oxidation-dehydrogenation using silver or metal-oxide catalysts at high reactor temperatures of more than 500\u00b0C\u2013600\u00b0C, resulting in substantial carbon dioxide emissions and energy penalties.      Harnessing sunlight to convert methaneIn their study, the team discovers a new way of turning methane gas into formaldehyde using sunlight. They found that a mixture of atomically dispersed copper and partially reduced tungsten species over tungsten oxide worked really well\u2014the synergistic ensemble enabling exceptional photocatalytic methane conversion to formaldehyde under ambient visible light. The process exhibited nearly 100% selectivity and high conversion efficiency, significantly outperforming previously reported photocatalysts (with a turnover frequency, TOF = 8.5\u00d7106 \u03bcmol (HCHO)\u00b7g-1(cocatalyst)\u00b7h-1).Through mechanistic analysis, they figured out that the copper helped to move electrons around and create reactive molecular species while the tungsten helped to activate the methane gas. Specifically, the copper acted as electron acceptors and promoted photo-induced electron transfer from the conduction band to dioxygen, generating reactive hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO\u00b7). Meanwhile, the adjacent tungsten atom that had a partial positive charge functioned as hole acceptors. The preferred adsorption and activation site of water produced hydroxyl radicals and effectively activated methane to methyl radicals. The synergy of the adjacent dual active sites greatly enhances the overall efficiency and selectivity of the conversion process.This finding paves the way for further research and development of new photo-catalysts for a variety of chemical conversions, promoting more sustainable and efficient processes in the chemical industry.\"Solar conversion of methane is highly desirable for both low-carbon and high-value-added chemical syntheses. However, product selectivity and production efficiency are key to success. This requires an in-depth understanding of the conversion mechanism, careful design of the catalyst, and complementary techniques to confirm its performance\u2014a good case of multidisciplinary tasks that require strong collaborative dedication.

  "text": "With its golden hue, bittersweet notes and frothy head, Stefan Fritsche's latest brew looks and tastes like any other beer.          But the revolutionary tipple, developed at Fritsche's brewery in the German town of Neuzelle, was made with just two ingredients: powder and water.\"Everyone can have their own home brewery\" with his new invention, Fritsche told AFP at the premises near the border with Poland.For now, the recipe finalized earlier this year is non-alcoholic and also contains no carbon dioxide, meaning it has no bubbles.But Fritsche, 56, is also developing an alcoholic version and eventually planning to add bubbles to make it even more beer-like.The main target market will be African and Asian countries, since a powder is far easier and cheaper to transport over long distances than bottles of beer.But the product may not go down too smoothly at home in Germany, which has a 500-year-old purity law around beer known as the \"Reinheitsgebot\".\"We know that pilsner drinkers and craft beer enthusiasts, especially in Germany, will initially be skeptical about our product,\" the brewery admits on its website.It is unclear whether the product could even be marketed as beer under the strict rules, which limit the ingredients to malt, hops, yeast and water.Fritsche declines to reveal his recipe but argues that his invention is necessary in a world that needs sustainable solutions.The brewer is still working with investors to roll out the powder commercially, but is hoping to start selling it within around four months.Sustainable ambitionsThe powdered format, developed with European laboratories over the past two years, makes the beverage 90 percent cheaper to export than traditional beer, he said.                The brewery believes that the powdered format, developed with European laboratories over the past two years, makes the beverage 90 percent cheaper to export than traditional beer.             \"We want to become the first sustainable brewery in the world.\"According to the Impact CO2 carbon footprint calculator, packaging and transport account for 70 percent of the environmental impact of a liter (around two pints) of beer.      The powdered format also saves time, as laboratory production is faster than traditional brewing, which takes two months on average.But German experts are skeptical about whether the idea will catch on.Powdered beer is a \"nice innovation\", but \"it will not endanger or even challenge our traditional breweries\", said Benedikt Meier of the Bavarian Private Breweries Association.The \"Bier und Wir\" brewers' association also has doubts.\"The enjoyment of beer is primarily about conviviality, as it is enjoyed in pubs, in your local, at a party or among friends and like-minded people,\" it said.\"A beer powder whose use focuses on preparation at home is not a serious alternative for this target group.\"Previous attempts to market powdered beers have fallen flat.In 2016, a Danish brewery announced the creation of four varieties of powder with different flavors\u2014but no trace of the project remains on its website.And in 2014, US company Lipsmark made headlines with its hard-liquor sachets, but the product was banned in most states and then withdrawn before it even hit the shelves.But Fritsche is determined that his product will succeed where others have failed.\"We want to go down a new path, so to speak... to make a real, normal and good-tasting beer out of powder,\" he said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:German brewery has high hops for powdered beer (2023, May 28)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-german-brewery-high-powdered-beer.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have attracted much attention because of high conversion efficiency, low environmental pollution, and high specific energy, which can be widely used in vehicles such as automobiles, airplanes, and stationary power stations.          The cathodic and anodic electrochemical catalysis processes in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) are mainly composed of unit steps such as liquid-phase mass transfer, species adsorption and desorption, electron transfer, and surface transformation occurring at the electrode interface in series.It implies that electrochemical catalysis is a complex system including multiple scales in space and time: electron transfer at the quantum scale; active sites at the atomic scale; the triple phase boundary and the electrocatalytic ORR mechanism at the molecular level; catalyst and proton conductor at the nanometer scale; the catalytic layer and MEA at the micrometer scale; and the fuel cell stack at the meter scale.Particularly, each of the scales could greatly affect the electrochemical ORR process and the cell performance. Thus deeply understanding the characteristics and behavior under any scale is the key to greatly enhance the electrocatalytic performance. Of the scales, the catalyst design at the nanometer scale has attracted great attention.Recently, the research group led by Prof. Zidong Wei and Jing Li from Chongqing University, China, outlined the recent developments of carbon-based ORR catalysts from mechanistic understanding and porous structure. The review was published in Chinese Journal of Catalysis.Developing carbon-based catalysts contributes to the large-scale application of fuel cells and metal-air batteries on account of their extremely high cost effectiveness. This review summarized the research progress regarding carbon-based catalysts in terms of the fabrication of active sites, catalyst stability, and strategies for forming porous structures.Atomic-scale dispersion and doping are the most used methods in generating active sites in metal-containing carbon-based catalysts. Heteroatomic doping is a common strategy for fabricating active sites in metal-free carbon-based catalysts. We then analyzed the causes of catalyst deactivation and how to improve the stabilities and anti-poisoning properties of the catalysts.Finally, as the porous structures significantly affect the exposure of the active sites and mass transfer, the effects of the different porous structures on the ORR and the preparation strategies of micro-, meso-, and macroporous carbon materials were reviewed.

  "question_squad": " What is the key ingredient in the film?",
  "answer_squad": " amylose starch",
  "text": "A group of researchers from universities in Thailand and Malaysia have collaborated to develop a unique film that is good for the environment and can decompose naturally. They made this film using leftover pineapple stems, which helps reduce the use of harmful plastic films. This new film has the potential to be used as packaging material, contributing to a more sustainable way of doing business and promoting a circular economy.          In the study published in Membranes, Associate Professor Taweechai Amornsakchai from Mahidol University, Thailand led his team of researchers to successfully developed a biodegradable starch film derived from pineapple stem waste, offering a sustainable alternative to non-biodegradable petroleum-based films commonly used for single-use applications that do not require high strength. The key ingredient utilized in this film is high amylose starch extracted from pineapple stems, which serves as the matrix for the material. To enhance its ductility and flexibility, glycerol and citric acid were incorporated as additives.Maintaining a fixed glycerol content of 25%, the researchers experimented with varying levels of citric acid, ranging from 0% to 15% by weight of starch. This approach allowed for the preparation of films with a wide spectrum of mechanical properties, catering to diverse application requirements. As the concentration of citric acid increased, the resulting film exhibited a softer and weaker nature while demonstrating enhanced elongation at the point of fracture. The mechanical properties of the films spanned a broad range, from a strength of approximately 21.5 MPa with 2.9% elongation, to a strength of about 6.8 MPa with 35.7% elongation.To gain further insights into the structure of the films, X-ray diffraction analysis was performed, revealing a semi-crystalline nature. Additionally, the films displayed desirable water-resistant properties and the ability to be heat-sealed, opening up potential applications as packaging materials. To showcase the film's viability for single-use purposes, an exemplar single-use package was successfully demonstrated, underscoring its practicality and versatility.In order to validate the biodegradability of the material, a soil burial test was conducted. The results unequivocally confirmed that the starch film was biodegradable, as it completely disintegrated into particles smaller than 1 mm within the remarkably short span of one month. This promising characteristic suggests that the film has the potential to significantly mitigate the adverse environmental impact associated with the persistence of non-biodegradable materials.The development of this biodegradable starch film from pineapple stem waste holds immense promise for addressing the growing concerns regarding the proliferation of non-biodegradable packaging materials. By utilizing an abundant and renewable agricultural byproduct, the researchers have not only offered an eco-friendly alternative but have also contributed to the efficient utilization of resources and waste reduction. Furthermore, the incorporation of glycerol and citric acid additives allows for customization of the film's mechanical properties, enabling it to cater to a wide array of applications where strength requirements are not excessively demanding.This study serves as a significant milestone in the pursuit of sustainable materials for single-use applications, showcasing the potential of biodegradable films derived from agricultural waste. The findings highlight the importance of exploring innovative approaches to address environmental challenges and emphasize the feasibility of transitioning from petroleum-based materials to renewable alternatives. As the demand for eco-friendly solutions continues to escalate, the development of biodegradable starch films from pineapple stem waste represents a noteworthy contribution to the field of sustainable materials and paves the way for a greener and more sustainable future.

  "text": "Plasma engineers and chemists at the University of Illinois have demonstrated a sustainable way of forming carbon-carbon bonds\u2014the bedrock of all organic compounds\u2014without expensive, rare metals that are typically required as catalysts in bond-forming organic reactions.          Through an interdisciplinary collaboration, Illinois researchers in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering, Bioengineering and Chemistry combined their expertise to develop this novel metal-catalyst-free approach that could lead organic chemistry in a new direction, according to the researchers.In the study, \"Plasma Electrochemistry for Carbon\u2212Carbon Bond Formation via Pinacol Coupling,\" published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the team explains how they used electricity and a plasma-liquid process to generate solvated electrons to form carbon-carbon bonds in a pinacol coupling reaction. C-C bond formation is widely used in the production of many man-made chemicals like pharmaceuticals and plastics.According to researchers, this is the first example of plasma-generated solvated electrons for an organic redox coupling reaction and offers a sustainable solution for similar reductive organic reactions. Typically, such reactions require metal reagents or catalysts that are not only scarce and costly, but also present safety or environmental issues and sometimes require heat in the reactive process.\"Our process only really requires electricity\u2014other than the reactor cell and equipment\u2014and in the future hopefully this can come from renewable sources like wind or solar or nuclear, so the whole process is sustainable,\" said study co-author R. Mohan Sankaran, Donald Biggar Willett Professor in Engineering in the Department of Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering.Sankaran said their process produces electrons from argon gas and then injects these electrons into solution to generate solvated electrons, a powerful chemical species typically generated by radiolysis, which requires complex equipment.\"In our case, the solvated electrons are generated with just a DC power supply and a relatively simple electrolysis reactor that houses our electrodes and the solution where we have the organic substrates,\" said Sankaran, whose group has been developing atmospheric pressure plasmas for over a decade, and in previous work, has applied this type of plasma-liquid process to other applications\u2014nanoparticle synthesis and nitrogen fixation. \"We were curious about organic chemistry, but we had no expertise in either the methods or the characterization.\"      Sankaran, who reached out to Jeffrey S. Moore, research professor in chemistry, for expertise, said this project would not have been possible without the collaboration.\"Most of this is chemistry\u2014something that my group doesn't do\u2014and there is no way we would have succeeded without having someone with the requisite chemistry background,\" Sankaran said.Jian Wang, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral associate in the Moore group, brought his expertise in chemistry and materials science to the project and worked with plasma expert Scott Dubowsky, study co-author and research scientist in the Sankaran group, to learn the plasma-liquid process and then identify an organic reaction to study.Wang experimented with different organic substrates, characterizing reactions using various analytical techniques, and ultimately chose pinacol coupling, because it is a well-established reaction for carbon-carbon bond formation and a reaction they believed could work with the plasma liquid process. Matthew Confer, another co-author and a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Rohit Bhargava, professor of bioengineering and faculty affiliate in chemistry, used his computational chemistry expertise to model how the pinacol product was formed from the solvated electron chemistry and radical reactions.\"This is an excellent illustration of the golden rule for a successful collaboration: the best collaborators share a common goal but bring different expertise,\" said Moore, Stanley O. Ikenberry Research Professor, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor.There have been a few studies where a plasma was used for an organic reaction, Sankaran explained, but the reactions and the mechanism were different.\"The plasma was typically used to oxidize a chemical and the chemical that was produced by the plasma was a reactive oxygen species. In our case, the reaction we studied was reduction which required electrons (or solvated electrons), and the reduction led to the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds,\" Sankaran said.Their next step will be applying their process to another organic chemistry reaction and showing that this approach is general and can be applied to different reactions.\"We also hope to find a reaction that is difficult to carry out, because it has a low yield, requires harsh conditions, or there is no active metal,\" said Sankaran, who also explained that they hope to address one issue their study revealed\u2014that yields can be limited by mass transfer limitations. \"Our reaction occurs at the interface of a plasma and the solution, and for the substrate to reach the interface, it must diffuse. We can address this issue by incorporating liquid flow which will enhance mass transport by convection. Liquid flow will also potentially help us scale up the process whereby we can make a product continuously.\"Wang said one particular challenge for plasma electrochemistry as an alternative to more traditional organic synthesis is that the plasma is so energetic.\"Although we are able to achieve relatively good yield and selectivity, the control is still not as good as for example traditional chemistries with metal catalysts, or electro- or photocatalytic chemistries,\" Wang said. \"We are working on improving the controllability and selectivity right now.\" More information:Jian Wang et al, Plasma Electrochemistry for Carbon\u2013Carbon Bond Formation via Pinacol Coupling, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2023).

  "text": "Researchers led by Prof. Tian Jia from the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new strategy for visible-light-induced selective carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion by mimicking the key elements and assembly structures of natural photosynthetic purple bacterial chromatophores through supramolecular self-assembly.          This work, which offers new insights for accurately simulating the biological structures and functions of supramolecular assemblies and energy conversion for artificial photosynthesis, was published in Nature Catalysis on May 18.Photosynthesis is the ultimate source of energy and organic matter for nearly all living organisms. In nature, photosynthetic organelles harness solar radiation to produce energy-rich compounds from water and atmospheric CO2 via exquisite supramolecular assemblies.Although artificial photocatalytic cycles have been shown to operate with higher intrinsic efficiencies, the low selectivity and stability in water for multi-electron CO2 reduction hampers their practical applications. The creation of water-compatible artificial photocatalytic systems mimicking the natural photosynthetic apparatus for selective and efficient solar fuel production represents a major challenge.In this study, the researchers used a supramolecular assembly approach to create an artificial photosynthetic chromatophore nanomicelle system based on the structure of natural photosynthetic purple bacteria. The system was applied to selective CO2 catalytic conversion in water under visible light irradiation and showed excellent stability and efficiency.The team proposed a promising solution for energy conversion and storage through \"zero-carbon cycle\" pathways, which is an effective way to alleviate energy crisis and reduce carbon emissions.Benefiting from the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the spherical nanomicelles assembled from amphiphilic tri-block porphyrin-based supramolecules are extremely stable in aqueous phase. As a chromatophore, the nanomicelles exhibited obvious light-harvesting antenna effect and strong resistance to photobleaching.Moreover, electropositive ring-like porphyrin arrays of 4.2 nm in diameter were observed on their surface, and each sub-structure consists of ca. 12 porphyrin by calculation.For the purpose of efficient electron injection, an electronegative carbon monoxide catalyst was chosen as the ideal catalyst because the space distance between the catalyst and the ring-like porphyrin array was drawn closer by electrostatic force. Under the irradiation of visible light, the artificial photocatalytic system achieved the conversion of CO2 to methane with high efficiency and selectivity.In addition, the researchers proposed a two-stage mechanism in which carbon monoxide was regarded as intermediate species, which was further proved by isotope labeling experiment, steady-state and transient absorption spectra and density functional theory calculations.

  "text": "Using a high-speed \"electron camera\" at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and cutting-edge quantum simulations, scientists have directly imaged a photochemical \"transition state,\" a specific configuration of a molecule's atoms determining the chemical outcome, during a ring-opening reaction in the molecule \u03b1-terpinene. This is the first time that scientists have precisely tracked molecular structure through a photochemical ring-opening reaction, triggered when light energy is absorbed by a substance's molecules.          The results, published in Nature Communications, could further our understanding of similar reactions with vital roles in chemistry, such as the production of vitamin D in our bodies.Transition states generally occur in chemical reactions which are triggered not by light but by heat. They are like a point of no return for molecules involved in a chemical reaction: As the molecules gain the energy needed to fuel the reaction, they rearrange themselves into a fleeting configuration before they complete their transformation into new molecules.\"Transition states really tell you a lot about how and why reactions happen,\" said co-author and SLAC scientist Thomas Wolf. \"The investigation of similar critical configurations in photochemical reactions could lead to a better understanding of reactions with key roles in chemistry and biology. It's important that we can now look at some specific characteristics of such reactions using our diffraction techniques.\"Until now, no method existed that was sensitive enough to capture these fleeting states, which last for only millionths of a billionth of second. At MeV-UED, SLAC's instrument for ultrafast electron diffraction, the researchers sent an electron beam with high energy, measured in millions of electronvolts (MeV), through a gas to precisely measure distances between the atoms within the molecules in the gas. Taking snapshots of these distances at different intervals after an initial laser flash allows scientists to create a stop-motion movie of the light-induced atomic rearrangements in the molecules.\"These reactions are important for understanding the quantum mechanics underpinning photochemistry,\" said SLAC scientist and co-author Yusong Liu. \"Comparing our experimental results with quantum simulations of the reaction allows us to get a highly accurate picture of how molecules behave and benchmark the predictive power of theoretical and computational methods.\"In a previous study of a related reaction, MeV-UED allowed the team to capture the coordinated dance between electrons and nuclei. The results provided the first direct confirmation of a half-century-old set of rules about the final product's stereochemistry, or the three-dimensional arrangement of its atoms.In the present experiment, the researchers discovered that some parts of the atomic rearrangements happen earlier than other parts, which provides an explanation for why the specific stereochemistry is created by the reaction.\"I recently looked back on some old presentations I did in college about these types of reactions and the famous set of rules that predict the outcomes. But these rules don't actually explain why and how reactions happen.\" Wolf said. \"And now I'm coming back to that and can start answering these questions and that makes it incredibly exciting for me.\"Another big motivation for doing these experiments, Wolf said, is that the same reaction also happens in biological processes such as the biosynthesis of vitamin D in human skin. The researchers plan to conduct follow-up studies further exploring this connection. More information:Y.

  "text": "Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) provide a practical solution for direct conversion of CO2 to chemicals; however, an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the dynamic reconstruction of active sites for perovskite cathodes during CO2 electrolysis remains a great challenge.          In a study led by Dr. Houfu Lv, Prof. Guoxiong Wang and Prof. Xinhe Bao (Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences), the team identify that iridium-doped Sr2Fe1.45Ir0.05Mo0.5O6-\u03b4 (SFIrM) perovskite displays a dynamic electrochemical reconstruction feature during CO2 electrolysis with abundant exsolution of highly dispersed IrFe alloy nanoparticles (NPs) on the SFIrM surface, which is well investigated using in situ electrochemical X-ray diffraction (XRD), near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).During the electrochemical reconstruction and activation process under a constant voltage mode at 1.0 V for ~4 000 s, the current density gradually increased and finally approached a steady state.The exsolved IrFe alloy NPs display high dispersion with an average diameter of ~1.0 nm and a density above 80 000 \u03bcm-2 on the SFIrM surface. Moreover, the activation time was reduced rapidly with increasing applied voltage (constant voltage: 1.2 V, activation time: within 250 s), with similar particle size and density of the exsolved metal NPs during CO2 electrolysis.

Credit: Science China Press             In addition, in situ NAP-XPS measurements were employed to monitor their catalytic process during CO2 electrolysis to reveal the intrinsic reaction mechanism. Upon application of electrochemical polarization, a broader peak appeared at ca. 290 eV in the C 1s spectra, which could be attributed to carbonate species and was most probably decisive for CO2 electrolysis.The peak area of carbonate species on the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-\u03b4 (SFM) cathode was weaker than that on the SFIrM cathode. The enhanced carbonate intermediate species signal confirmed that the in situ reconstructed IrFe@SFIrM interfaces facilitated CO2 adsorption and activation. IrFe@SFIrM interfaces were thus proposed as the catalytically active sites that devoted to a higher CO2 electrolysis performance than SFM.The initial exsolved IrFe alloy NPs could be re-dispersed sufficiently into smaller nanoclusters via a brief oxidation treatment in air. IrFe alloy NPs were regenerated when the applied voltage was switched on again, and the appearance of the intermediate carbonate peak could be further obtained. The oxidative re-dispersion strategy could efficiently improve the stability by delaying particle aggregation.The research is published in the journal National Science Review.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the company that accompanied the study?",
  "answer_squad": " RD&C",
  "text": "Before their approval, pharmaceuticals not only have to be tested for their effectiveness and safety, but also for their stability, since they are usually stored in pharmacies and private households for years. To test stability, a process is needed that decomposes a drug \"in fast motion.\"          Such a method was recently developed by a team of scientists from the Leibniz Institute for Catalysis in Rostock (LIKAT), the RWTH Aachen University and the Julius Maximilian University of W\u00fcrzburg, accompanied by the company RD&C (Vienna, Austria). The research results have now been published in the journal ACS Central Science.Virtually all drugs are multicomponent or multiphase systems that are embedded in a matrix, i.e., contain excipients and carriers, for example. These additives can interact with the active ingredient over time, for example when the drugs are stored for a longer period of time and impair the effect of the drug. The pharmaceutical industry must disclose all stability data before a new drug is approved, so there is considerable interest in developing reliable predictive tools to assess the safety of drugs.Currently, however, such predictive tools for solid-state properties, particularly with respect to solid-state stability and degradation, are limited. In addition, the rate and decomposition products of solid-state degradation processes are unique for each compound, making the development of stability models very time-consuming and costly. Prediction methods in aqueous environments exist, but they lead to high error rates. Since irrelevant degradation products are often formed under these conditions, these prediction methods imply a high financial and health development risk for the manufacturer of new drugs and for the customer.Based on proof-of-concept studies successfully performed by RD&C and the team, a unique and innovative experimental method for predicting stability profiles and degradation pathways in solid compounds, mixtures and matrices has now been developed. In the literature, the approach is referred to as \"mechanochemistry.\" In this approach, the isolated drug or marketed pharmaceutical product is treated in a vibrating mill in the presence of a decomposition-inducing reagent. Within less than 15 minutes, degradation processes can be observed.Everaldo Krake (LIKAT Rostock), first author of the study and a newly graduated scientist, explains, \"We were able to show this on a series of structurally similar so-called thienopyridines, which are the drugs in antiplatelet tablets. Crucial to the success was the collaboration with the group led by Carsten Bolm (RWTH Aachen University), a world-leading expert in the field of mechanochemistry, and the team of Ulrike Holzgrabe (University of W\u00fcrzburg), a renowned pharmaceutical chemist. This showed that the degradation profiles are identical for both the pure drug and the finished pharmaceutical product. This means that reproducible and relevant statements can be made for this class of drugs in short reaction times using the active ingredient alone. This would be of great importance for accelerated drug approval.\"According to the authors, this new approach represents a paradigm shift in the application of mechanochemical processes in organic chemistry. \"In general, mechanochemical studies of the transformation of small organic molecules, particularly drugs, are carried out with the aim of producing specific structural motifs. The new work now published highlights the potential of this approach to also target specific structural motifs for degradation,\" says Carsten Bolm.This could be important not only for drug testing, but also for organic synthesis in general. \"In the future, it will be interesting to apply this mechanochemical approach to other drug families and to evaluate the role of other stimuli such as light or temperature for the forced degradation process,\" Ulrike Holzgrabe concludes.

  "text": "Today's outdoor clothing mainly relies on oil-based fibers and chemicals that are harmful for the environment. In her doctoral research, Helena Sederholm develops environmentally friendly water-repellent textiles by following the example of nature.          Sederholm, a doctoral researcher at Aalto University's Bioinnovation Center, wants to contribute to a sustainable future. \"Environmental and climate issues are close to my heart. I want to use my education and learning to solve the obstacles to a better world. There are many problems like this in the textile industry,\" says Sederholm.Originally from Espoo, Sederholm was already interested in natural sciences during her basic education and particularly keen on chemistry and biology. She started studying for a bachelor's degree at the Aalto University School of Chemical Engineering in 2017.\"During my studies, materials sciences and, in particular, biomaterials started to attract me. I ended up in the Master's Degree Program of Fiber and Polymer Technology, where I was able to familiarize myself with bio-based fibers. It felt right.\"The growing sector needs doctorsIn her master's thesis, Sederholm studied the recyclability of fibers produced with the Ioncell technology. The thesis indicated that recycled Ioncell fibers are just as suitable for textile production as original cellulose fibers. Sederholm graduated with a Master of Science degree in autumn 2022.\"In my master's thesis, I got to familiarize myself with the academic world of research. I liked experimental work and enjoyed my time in the research group.\"Postgraduate studies started to interest Sederholm, so she applied for doctoral studies at Aalto University's Bioinnovation Center, where she was able to start immediately after her master's studies.\"Bio-based textiles are still a new field in Finland, but this sector will surely grow. I believe that there will be a need for doctors with expertise and vision related to biomaterials by the time I finish my doctoral studies.\"Using natural phenomena as a modelIn her doctoral research, Sederholm develops an environmentally friendly way of producing hydrophobic textiles for outdoor clothing. The hydrophobic properties of today's outdoor clothing mainly result from synthetic fossil-based fibers. Fossil-free alternatives, on the other hand, contain chemicals that are harmful for the environment.\"Fortunately, water repellent materials can be found in nature. I try to copy them and apply similar methods in the Ioncell process. One option is to develop lignocellulosic fibers using lignin derived from wood. In addition to having hydrophobic properties, the fibers used in outdoor clothing must be sufficiently strong.\"The cross-disciplinary CelluMimicry study combines Aalto University's expertise in chemical technology and business.\"We are studying how to commercialize bio-based water-repellent materials and how suited they are for mass production. Sustainability and ecology are growing trends that increase responsibility in the consumption of clothing. On the other hand, there are also many challenges involved with the commercialization of bio-based materials, such as the cost of clothing and dyeing of textiles.\"Sederholm is inspired by the concrete nature of her doctoral research. \"One day, when my experiments have hopefully been successful, I can hold a piece of fabric in my hand and say, I did it!

  "text": "A research team led by Prof. Qin Xiaoying from the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has improved the thermoelectric performance of an n-type transition metal selenide, Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 (BTS), by incorporating MnSb2Se4 (MSS) nanoinclusions. Results were published in two articles in the Chemical Engineering Journal.          Thermoelectric technology has received considerable attention as a potential solution to energy problems. However, the low thermoelectric value ZT (figure of merit) and energy conversion efficiency of N-type bismuth telluride currently limit its widespread commercial application. Nanoengineering is an effective way to improve the thermoelectric properties of materials, but selecting a suitable second phase can be challenging.In this study, the researchers found that incorporating MnSb2Se4 into BTS can yield remarkable results.Incorporated MSS nanoinclusions have been shown to have multiple benefits. It could simultaneously increase the power factor, resulting from the improved thermal performance due to the energy filtering effect and reduce lattice thermal conductivity originating from intensified phonon scattering by the dislocations.The BTS/0.50wt%MSS composite sample demonstrated a maximum thermoelectric ZT of 1.23 at 345K, and an average ZT of 1.15 in the temperature range of 300\u2013473K.Notably, these values represented an approximate increase of 48% and 42%, respectively, over the matrix BTS. In addition, the composite sample exhibited improved mechanical properties, as evidenced by a 17% increase in its Vickers hardness.The results indicate that the incorporation of the MnSb2Se4 secondary phase is an effective way to improve thermoelectric performance and mechanical properties of BTS.The researchers have made significant progress in optimizing the thermoelectric properties of thermoelectric materials at room temperature. In 2022, they found that incorporating polyaniline nanoparticles into the BTS matrix could enhance phonon scattering and reduce the lattice thermal conductivity by 49% at 300K.\"It results in an 8% increase in power factor and a maximum ZTmax of 1.22 at 345K for the 1.5 wt% composite sample,\" said Chen Tao, a member of the team, \"which is an attempt of organic compound, and also for the later inorganic-organic compound system research to lay a certain foundation.\" More information:Shuhuan Yang et al, Enhanced phonon scattering and thermoelectric performance for N-type Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 through incorporation of conductive polyaniline particles, Chemical Engineering Journal (2022).

  "text": "Processes inside human cells are tightly regulated in time and space by various enzymes and proteins. However, if processes become unbalanced\u2014for example, because cells experience increased stress\u2014these processes can also lead to diseases.          For example, proteins can \"aggregate\"\u2014that is, cluster together and form extended, ordered, straight fibers, similar to a Mikado. While most proteins have a well-defined three-dimensional structure, some exist in cells without any structure, like a long string.This category of proteins is called intrinsically disordered. Recently such intrinsically disordered proteins have received considerable attention as driving cellular organization and have been linked to neurodegeneration. However, it is unclear how these disordered and flexible proteins become structured to build the Mikado.A team of researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research and the University of Texas has now shown that interfaces can trigger aggregation of a model intrinsically disordered protein\u2014called FUS (fused in sarcoma). This disordered protein is flexible in the bulk, but at a hydrophobic interface, it forms fibers. These FUS proteins form connected \"Mikado-networks \" that cannot be easily broken down and may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.\"We looked at the formation of FUS fibers at the hydrophobic interface using laser-based methods including spectroscopy and microscopy,\" say Mischa Bonn and Yuki Nagata. The researchers observed the formation of fibers through the collective ordered assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins. The researchers further showed that protein mobility was dramatically reduced upon fiber formation: the proteins are stuck in the fibers they form.\"We were able to demonstrate that hydrophobic interfaces\u2014for example, small oily droplets in cells\u2014can seed molecular ordering and fiber formation,\" explains Sapun Parekh, also a group leader in Mischa Bonn's department and a professor at the University of Austin, Texas. \"This formation happens at surprisingly low concentrations: concentrations 600 times lower than necessary for forming loose protein clusters in solution,\" Parekh adds.The scientists hope their research will contribute to future understanding of how neurodegenerative diseases develop.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the technique that allows for the resolution of a single molecule to be separated?",
  "answer_squad": " RESI",
  "text": "A breakthrough in fluorescence microscopy has been achieved by the research group of Ralf Jungmann at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry (MPIB) and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t (LMU) Munich. The team developed Resolution Enhancement by Sequential Imaging (RESI), a revolutionary technique that enhances the resolution of fluorescence microscopy down to the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m scale. This innovation is poised to usher in a paradigm shift in our approach to study biological systems with thus far unprecedented detail.          Cells, the fundamental units of life, contain a plethora of intricate structures, processes and mechanisms that uphold and perpetuate living systems. Many cellular core components, such as DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids, are just a few nanometers in size. This makes them substantially smaller than the resolution limit of traditional light microscopy. The exact composition and arrangement of these molecules and structures is thus often unknown, resulting in a lack of mechanistic understanding of fundamental aspects of biology.In recent years, super-resolution techniques have made leaps and bounds to resolve many sub-cellular structures below the classical diffraction limit of light. Single molecule localization microscopy, or SMLM, is a super-resolution approach that can resolve structures on the order of ten nanometers in size by temporally separating their individual fluorescence emission.As individual targets stochastically light up (they blink) in an otherwise dark field of view, their location can be determined with sub-diffraction precision. DNA-PAINT, invented by the Jungmann group, is a SMLM technique that uses transient hybridization of dye-labeled DNA \"imager\" strands to their target-bound complements to achieve the necessary blinking for super-resolution. However, to date, even DNA-PAINT has not been able to resolve the smallest cellular structures.In the current study, published in Nature and led by co-first authors Susanne Reinhardt, Luciano Masullo, Isabelle Baudrexel and Philipp Steen together with Jungmann, the team introduces a novel approach in super-resolution microscopy that enables fundamentally \"unlimited\" spatial resolution.The new technique, called resolution enhancement by sequential imaging, or RESI for short, capitalizes on the ability of DNA-PAINT to encode target identity via unique DNA sequences. By labeling adjacent targets, too close to each other to be resolved even by super-resolution microscopy, with different DNA strands, an additional degree of differentiation (a barcode) is introduced into the sample. By sequentially imaging first one, and then the other sequence (and thereby target), they can now be unambiguously separated.      Critically, as they are imaged sequentially, the targets can be arbitrarily close to each other, something no other technique can resolve. Furthermore, RESI does not require specialized instrumentation, in fact, it can be applied using any standard fluorescence microscope, making it easily accessible for almost all researchers.To demonstrate RESI's leap in resolution, the team set themselves the challenge of resolving one of the smallest spatial distances in a biological system: The separation between individual bases along a double helix of DNA, spaced less than one nanometer apart.By designing a DNA origami nanostructure such that it presents single-stranded DNA sequences that protrude from a double helix at one base pair distance and then imaging these single strands sequentially, the research team resolved a distance of 0.85 nm (or 8.5 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m) between adjacent bases, a previously unimaginable feat. The researchers accomplished these measurements with a precision of 1 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m, or one 10-billionth of a meter, underscoring the unprecedented capabilities of the RESI approach.Importantly, the technique is universal and not limited to applications in DNA nanostructures. To this end, the team investigated the molecular mode of action of Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that was first approved in 1997 for treatment of CD20-positive blood cancer. However, investigating the effects of such drug molecules on molecular receptor patterns has been beyond the spatial resolution capabilities of traditional microscopy techniques. Understanding whether and how such patterns change in health and disease as well as upon treatment is not only important for basic mechanistic research, but also for designing novel targeted disease therapies.Using RESI, Jungmann and his team were able to reveal the natural arrangement of CD20 receptors in untreated cells as dimers and uncover how CD20 re-arranged to chains of dimers upon drug treatment. The insights on the single-protein level now help to shed light on the molecular mode of action of Rituximab.As RESI is performed in whole, intact cells, the technique closes the gap between purely structural techniques such as X-ray crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy and traditional lower resolution whole-cell imaging approaches. Jungmann and his team are convinced that \"this unprecedented technique is a true game-changer not only for super-resolution, but for biological research as a whole.\" More information:Susanne C. M.

  "text": "In aerobic organisms, reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxide (OH), singlet oxygen (1O2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and superoxide (O2\u2013) ions are produced during aerobic respiration, which causes serious oxidative damage to biomolecules in the body. Hence, the removal of ROS, particularly O2\u2013, is of primary importance as it reacts with H+ to produce other toxic ROS species like H2O2 and OH.          This is achieved by metalloenzymes called superoxide dismutases (SODs). These enzymes possess metal ions (like Ni, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn) in their active centers that catalyze the decomposition of O2\u2013 to H2O2 and O2. In this regard, low molecular weight Cu(II) complexes have gained importance as functional SOD models that exhibit high SOD activity. However, they are limited by their tendency to become toxic to the biomolecules after the release of Cu(II).In a recent study, a group of researchers led by Assistant Professor Daisuke Nakane and Professor Takashiro Akitsu from the Department of Chemistry, Tokyo University of Science (TUS), has developed a novel metal-protein hybrid complex with enhanced ROS activity. They coupled the hydrolytic enzyme lysozyme with SOD-active Cu(II) complex to form the hybrid lysozyme CuST@lysozyme, which showed promising SOD activity but low biotoxicity.\"We investigated the formation of a hybrid protein composed of lysozyme and a functional SOD-mimetic Cu(II) complex. We chose lysozyme owing to its stability and crystallinity. We theorized that the resulting SOD-mimetic hybrid protein would improve the biocompatibility and stability of the functional SOD model Cu(II) complex,\" explains Dr. Nakane as the rationale behind their study. The study was published on in Scientific Reports.Through detailed crystallographic and spectroscopic analysis, the research team, which also comprised Assistant Professor Kenichi Kitanishi from TUS, Dr. Arshak Tsaturyan from Southern Federal University, and Professor Masaki Unno from Ibaraki University, among others, confirmed the formation of the hybrid protein CuST@lysozyme, and elucidated its structure.They report that the His15 imidazole group of the lysozyme binds to the Cu(II) center of  CuST  in the equatorial position while the CuST unit is fixed axially by several weak coordination and hydrogen bonds. Further they also suggest that O2\u2013 can coordinate to the Cu(II) center. Through assays, the researchers established high SOD activity and stability of the biocompatible CuST@lysozyme hybrid protein complex.Based on their spectroscopic and quantum calculations, the team propose a five-step mechanism of O2\u2013 disproportionation by the complex. These steps are (1) Cu(II) resting state, (2) O2\u2013-binding Cu(II) state, (3) Cu(I) resting state after protonation of the carboxylate ligand, (4) O2\u2013-interacted Cu(I) state, and (5) H2O2-interacted Cu(II) state.They further suggest that the stability of the complex can be improved by suppressing ligand dissociation by using late-transition-metal complexes for binding lysozyme, increasing interaction between the complexes and lysozyme by using ligands with hydrogen-bonding moieties, and introducing acidic functional groups to counter the basic side chains of lysozyme.The study introduces a new class of SOD active hybrid protein complexes that are biocompatible and have no side reactions with bodily fluids after decomposition of the mimetic complex. \"We have strategically improved the stability of the metal\u2013lysozyme composites, specifically in biological fluids such as plasma and cytosol. This should pave the way for deeper discussions on their therapeutic applications,\" concludes Prof. Akitsu.

  "text": "Scientists at McMaster University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have used artificial intelligence to discover a new antibiotic that could be used to fight a deadly, drug-resistant pathogen that strikes vulnerable hospital patients.          The process they used could also speed the discovery of other antibiotics to treat many other challenging bacteria.The researchers were responding to the urgent need for new drugs to treat Acinetobacter baumannii, identified by the World Health Organization as one of the world's most dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Notoriously difficult to eradicate, A. baumannii can cause pneumonia, meningitis and infect wounds, all of which can lead to death.A. baumanni is usually found in hospital settings, where it can survive on surfaces for long periods. The pathogen is able to pick up DNA from other species of bacteria in its environment, including antibiotic-resistance genes.In the study, published today in the journal Nature Chemical Biology, researchers report they used an artificial intelligence algorithm to predict new structural classes of antibacterial molecules, and identified a new antibacterial compound, which they have named abaucin.Discovering new antibiotics against A. baumannii through conventional screening has been challenging. Traditional methods are time-consuming, costly, and limited in scope.Modern algorithmic approaches can access hundreds of millions, possibly billions, of molecules with antibacterial properties.

  "text": "Danish painters in the 19th century may have turned to an unusual source for some of their supplies: breweries.          Researchers examined paintings from the Danish Golden Age and found traces of yeast and grains. That suggests painters were turning to byproducts from local breweries to prepare canvases, they reported Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.Study author Cecil Krarup Andersen said they went into the project looking for glue made from animals.\"Then, by surprise, we found something completely different,\" said Andersen, a paintings conservator at the Royal Danish Academy.The brewing leftovers would have been spread over the canvases as a paste, creating a smooth surface and preventing the paint from seeping through, Andersen explained. Today, this priming process is usually done with a white mixture known as gesso.The authors said that knowing what's on the canvases will help in conserving them.In the study, scientists took a look at works by two of the first master painters to come out of Denmark\u2014Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, considered the father of Danish painting, and Christen Schiellerup Kobke.To get a peek underneath their scenes of bobbing ships and family portraits, researchers used pieces of canvas that had been trimmed off the paintings in an earlier conservation project.

Instead, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, which prepared canvases for its artists, likely bought leftover mash from local breweries.This kind of recycling wasn't uncommon, Andersen added: Artists also used bits of sails for their canvases and boiled leather scraps for their glue. Records from the time also suggested that beer products may have been used in the arts.

The two subjects are equal passions for chemistry Ph.D. candidate Robert Addai, who works in Western's Material Science Addition lab and studies how metals corrode when they come into contact with food and road salts.It all started with fufu, a common staple in his diet growing up in Ghana. A starchy food that's common in West African cuisine, traditionally fufu is made by pounding cassava, a tropical root vegetable. That labor-intensive process can take hours.The preparation of fufu has evolved, the same way butter and other food staples have become almost exclusively machine produced. Most people now use a metal \"fufu pounding machine\" that offers the repetitive pounding action in a hands-free form, Addai explained.\"It is a delicious food, but it takes a lot of time. The machines also works in the form of friction, by pounding. My research is focused on whether metals are released from the machine into the fufu,\" Addai said.Addai measures the chromium, iron, manganese and nickel present in samples of fufu, by testing a slurry of the food in contact with samples of two types of carefully cleaned stainless steel. After breaking it down in a digester, he analyzes the solution for trace amounts of metals using a specialized tool to quantify metal ions. After reviewing initial results, he found the highest concentrations of iron followed by manganese, chromium and nickel.Addai tests fufu made from powder, cassava flour, which is the most common preparation for those making the food in Canada, as well as some homemade samples of traditional fufu made by machine.His samples are tested after 30 minutes, 24 hours and one week, since fufu can be cooked for various lengths of time. The release of metals increases with time, Addai has found. In some samples, there are potentially harmful levels of nickel and chromium, which have been linked to possible health effects such as respiratory and cardiovascular issues, as well as some types of cancer.Health concerns originally sparked Addai's interest. He wanted to know if the metals in contact with food enjoyed by his friends and family were playing a role in rates of illness.      \"There are a lot of people, not only in Ghana, but all over the world, especially in the diaspora who are suffering from cancer, heart disease and other illness. Scientifically, we don't always know the cause. So I wanted to study this (food preparation) from the start to check if some of the diseases are coming from this food,\" he said.There are other concerns, too, such as the type of metal used to create the fufu machines.\"They use recycled materials, that can contain a lot of lead,\" said chemistry professor Yolanda Hedberg, Addai's supervisor. She conducts similar research testing for the prevalence of metals in dairy products.Addai's deep dive into fufu led him to similar research on metal corrosion in an environment far from a Ghanaian kitchen: an icy Canadian road.Hedberg needed a researcher to work on a new project in the Material Science Addition lab. Addai had the knowledge and the willingness to jump in, Hedberg said.In addition to investigating metals in contact with fufu, Addai is now looking at different brands of road salt used for melting and grip on the roadways in Canada's coldest months. Despite straddling two seemingly disparate fields\u2014from fufu to road salts\u2014Addai conducts the same kind of core research in both projects.Last winter, Addai began running tests on the same squares of stainless steel he used for his cassava research. This time, they were laid out in a parking lot of Western Research Parks for a small pilot project. The metal was left outside for two months and monitored as it was sprayed weekly with nine different varieties of road salt.Addai will continue that work next winter, along with other researchers, to look at the environmental effects of popular types of road salt, including the type used by Western's facilities management team.\"We hope to recommend the best product, to balance effectiveness with environmental impact,\" he said.Addai said it can sometimes be tedious to wait for the results of his studies, many of which undergo multiple stages and phases. It takes time to reach the stage of final analysis.But challenges in examining the tiniest particles of fufu haven't dimmed his enthusiasm for the subject\u2014or the food.Addai is traveling home to Ghana soon and said he can't wait to enjoy the fufu made by his loved ones, instead of the version he makes in Canada using cassava flour.\"I told my family, have the fufu ready,\" Addai said with a laugh. \"It's the first thing I want to do. I miss it so much.\" Provided byUniversity of Western OntarioCitation:From beloved West African cuisine to Canadian road salt, corrosion study opens new path (2023, May 24)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-beloved-west-african-cuisine-canadian.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The increasingly inferior quality of heavy oil resources has brought more difficult challenges to traditional heavy oil processing technology. The high temperature and pressure conditions, and the carbon emission and energy consumption required to convert heavy oil to value-added chemicals are far from ideal.          Plasma technology is a potential approach to tackle this problem without catalysts, high-temperature and high-pressure conditions during the reaction. It also has advantages of short process flow, low carbon emissions and wide material adaptability. However, this technology is complicated due to the inert nature of heavy oil.Researchers led by Prof. Shao Tao from the Institute of Electrical Engineering (IEE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and their collaborators have explored the conversion laws and reaction mechanisms of plasma-enabled heavy oil conversion using different types of pulsed discharge plasma, and converted heavy oil into acetylene, carbon materials or cycloalkanes.Their research findings have been published in the Chemical Engineering Journal with the titles \"Catalyst-free toluene hydrogenation to methyl-cyclohexane by pulsed DBD plasma under ambient conditions\" and \"One-step high-value conversion of heavy oil into H2, C2H2 and carbon nanomaterials by non-thermal plasma.\"With microsecond pulsed spark discharge plasma, the researchers investigated heavy oil cracking characteristics in terms of pulse voltage, pulse repetition frequency and discharge power. Emission spectral analysis revealed the rapid heating and cooling mechanism of the pulsed spark plasma.They achieved one-step cracking of heavy oil into acetylene, hydrogen and nano-carbon materials, with heavy oil conversion rate of 50.4%, acetylene yield of 19.7%, and energy consumption of 55.4 kWh/m3.

  "text": "Designing the next generation of efficient energy conversion devices for powering our electronics and heating our homes requires a detailed understanding of how molecules move and vibrate while undergoing light-induced chemical reactions.          Researchers at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have now visualized the distortions of chemical bonds in a methane molecule after it absorbs light, loses an electron, and then relaxes. Their study provides insights into how molecules react to light, which can ultimately be useful for developing new methods to control chemical reactions.Examining how a molecule responds to light on extremely fast timescales allows researchers to track how electrons move during a chemical reaction. \"The big question is how a molecule dissipates energy without breaking apart,\" said Enrico Ridente, a physicist at Berkeley Lab and lead author on the Science paper reporting the work. This means examining how excess energy is redistributed in a molecule that has been excited by light, as the electrons and nuclei move about while the molecule relaxes to an equilibrium state.Probing these fine-scale movements means making observations of processes that occur on timescales faster than a millionth of a billionth of a second. For decades, researchers have relied on theory to describe how excess energy affects the symmetry of\u2014but does not break\u2014the bonds of a molecule that's been excited by light. This theory predicts how the bond lengths and angles between individual atoms should change while electrons shift position, and what intermediate structures it should adopt.Now, using ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy facilities at Berkeley Lab's Chemical Sciences Division, Ridente and his colleagues observed how the structure of ionized methane molecules evolves over time.\"Methane ions are an ideal system to address this question because they do not come apart when excited by light,\" said Ridente.The angles between atoms in an excited methane molecule change as the molecule relaxes, distorting its shape and redistributing the absorbed energy. Credit: Diptarka Hait/Berkeley LabBy first using a laser to strip an electron from the neutral methane molecule, then taking ultrafast X-ray spectroscopic snapshots of the remaining ion, the researchers collected a time series of spectral signals. The signals revealed how the initially symmetric shape becomes distorted over a ten-femtosecond period (a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second)\u2014observational evidence of a long-studied effect called Jahn-Teller distortion.      Longer time observations showed that for another 58 femtoseconds, the distorted shape vibrates coherently in a scissoring-like motion while redistributing its energy via other vibrations through the structure's geometric changes.\"Thanks to these measurements and the understanding gained from theory, we were able to time-resolve the full evolution of the distortion for the first time,\" said Stephen Leone, a chemist at Berkeley Lab and the senior author on the Science paper.The researchers used the Cori and Perlmutter systems at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a DOE Office of Science user facility at Berkeley Lab, to perform calculations that confirmed their measurements of the molecule's movements.\"We can now explain how the molecule distorts after losing an electron and how the energies of the electrons respond to these changes,\" said Diptarka Hait, a graduate student at Berkeley Lab and the lead theoretical author of the study.The study demonstrated the viability of an X-ray approach for studying ultrafast molecular dynamics. Methane is a fundamental yet simple molecule where one of the most basic types of distortions occurs as predicted, but with richer and more complicated dynamics than previously understood.\"This research opens the door for studying more complex systems and other types of distortions,\" says Ridente. Such insights about the dynamics of electrons and nuclei can lead to innovations in new energy conversion devices and photocatalysis applications.

  "text": "Prof. Liang Haojun from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) proposed a new catalytic assembly approach to escape from metastable states in a far-from-equilibrium system of DNA-functionalized colloids. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.          Self-assembly refers to the process in which assembled primitive elements (molecules, nanoparticles, etc.) spontaneously form ordered structures through non-covalent interactions. The excellent capacity of the system to create new materials has drawn attention. In an ideal assembly process, the system will reach a thermodynamically stable state with the lowest free energy and form a high-quality assembly structure. However, for the assembly system far away from the equilibrium state, the system is prone to be stuck in metastability where the local free energy is extremely small, blocking the formation of a high-quality assembly structure.How to circumvent metastability in a far-from-equilibrium system is regarded as a challenging conundrum in the field of self-assembly. For DNA-functionalized nanoparticle assembly, a typical far-from-equilibrium system, the entropy-controlled thermal annealing strategy constitutes a traditional and generally adopted way to escape from metastability. Nevertheless, the aggregation and dispersion of nanoparticles usually occur over a narrow temperature span during annealing. In correcting misconnected non-covalent bonds, thermal energy is not selective. Thermal annealing is not conducive to the assembly of biologically active particles or under physiological conditions.Inspired by the concept of \"catassembly\" proposed by academician Tian Zhongqun from Xiamen University, Prof. Liang and his team presented a new way to achieve catalytic-assembly of DNA-functionalized colloidal nanoparticles in a far-from-equilibrium system. Based on their prediction on theoretical simulation and previous research results on constant enthalpy control strategy for nanoparticle assembly, they employed a removable molecule named a \"catassembler,\" which serves as a catalyst, to adjust imperfect linkages and assist the system to escape from metastability while preserving assembled framework.In this strategy, the short DNA strand acting as the accelerator has a direct competitive effect with the bonding end on the surface of the nanoparticles inside the assembly structure, and the non-covalent bond of the wrong connection could be corrected by the transient DNA strand replacement reaction, assisting the system to escape from the metastability. During the process, the accelerator would not destroy the overall skeleton of the assembly structure, and it could be removed from the final assembly structure. Moreover, by changing the structural design of the accelerator, it could even reduce the dosage of the accelerator and improve its efficiency.On the basis of the same principle, superlattice structures with different crystal symmetries can be obtained by changing the kernel type of nanoparticles in a two-component system and directly adding the corresponding DNA accelerator after the design of the DNA sequence. This strategy makes the implementation of the assembly of nanoparticles easy to carry out as the chemical reaction occurs at a constant temperature.Furthermore, this DNA accelerator regulation strategy is simple and effective enough that the \"solid\u2013solid\" phase transformation between different colloidal crystals becomes easier to achieve, after breaking through the constraints of the temperature regulation and the initial phase state free energy. It displays its application potential in structurally reconfigurable \"solid\u2013solid\" phase transformation bio-inorganic composites.As a general method for regulating non-covalent interactions within assembly structures, the accelerator strategy proposed in this study is expected to be extended to the controlling and devising of assembly processes for other soft material systems (polypeptides, block copolymers, etc.) that are far from equilibrium.

  "text": "Many of the biological materials that researchers are most interested in studying, including those associated with major diseases, don't lend themselves to the conventional methods that researchers typically use to probe a material's structure and chemistry.          One technique, called magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, or MAS-NMR, has proven highly successful as a way of determining the properties of complex molecules such as some proteins. But the resolution achievable with such systems depends on the spinning frequency of tiny rotors, and these systems have bumped up against limits imposed by the rotor materials.Most such devices used today rely on rotors made of yttria-stabilized zirconia, which are as thin as a pin. Such rotors fall apart if spun much faster than a few million revolutions per minute, limiting the materials that can be studied with such systems. But now, researchers at MIT have developed a method for making these tiny, precise rotors out of pure diamond crystal, whose much greater strength could allow it to spin at far higher frequencies. The advance opens the door to studying a wide variety of important molecules, including those found in the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease.The new method is described in the Journal of Magnetic Resonance, in a paper by MIT graduate students Natalie Golota, Zachary Fredin, Daniel Banks, and David Preiss; professors Robert Griffin, Neil Gershenfeld, and Keith Nelson; and seven others at MIT.The MAS-NMR technique, Gershenfeld says, \"is the tool of choice for [analyzing] complex biological proteins in biologically meaningful environments.\" For example, a sample could be analyzed in a liquid environment as opposed to being dried out or crystallized or coated for examination. \"Only [solid-state] NMR does it in the ambient chemical environment,\" he says.The basic method has existed for decades, Griffin explains, and involves placing a tiny cylinder filled with the material to be studied into a magnetic field where it can be suspended and spun up to high frequencies using jets of gas, usually nitrogen, and then zapped with radio-frequency pulses to determine key properties of the material. The term \"magic angle\" refers to the fact that if the cylinder containing the sample spins at one precise angle (54.74 degrees) relative to the applied magnetic field, various sources of broadening of the spectral lines are attenuated and a much higher-resolution spectrum is possible.                These tiny rotors could make it possible to use magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, or MAS-NMR, to determine the structural and chemical properties of certain complex biological molecules. Credit: Massachusetts Institute of Technology             But the resolution of these spectra is directly limited by how fast the tiny cylinders, or rotors, can spin before they shatter. Over the years, early versions were made of various plastics, then later ceramic materials were used, and finally zirconium, \"which is the material of choice that most rotors are made of these days,\" Griffin says.Such MAS-NMR systems are widely used in biochemical research as a tool for studying the molecular structure, down to the level of individual atoms, of materials including proteins that are difficult or impossible to probe using other standard lab methods. These include not only amyloid fibrils, but membrane proteins and some viral assemblies. But some of the most pressing challenges in both biomedical and materials science lie just beyond reach of the resolution of today's MAS-NMR systems.\"As we progressed to spinning frequencies above 100 kilohertz,\" equivalent to 6 million revolutions per minute, Griffin says, \"these rotors have become very problematic. They fail about 50% of the time\u2014and you lose a sample, and it destroys the NMR coil.\" The team decided to tackle the problem, which many said at the time was impossible, of making the rotors out of single crystal diamond.Even the company making the laser system they used thought it couldn't be done, and it took years of work by an interdisciplinary team, involving students and researchers at both MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms and the Department of Chemistry, to solve that fabrication problem. (The collaboration grew out of Griffin and Gershenfeld serving on MIT's Killian Award Committee). They developed a kind of laser-based lathe system that rapidly spins a piece of diamond while zapping it with the laser, essentially vaporizing its outer layers until a perfectly smooth cylinder remains, just 0.7 millimeters across (about 1/36 inch). Then, the same laser is used to drill a perfectly centered hole through the middle of the cylinder, leaving a sort of drinking-straw shape.\"It's not obvious it would work,\" Gershenfeld says, \"but the laser turns the diamond into graphite and drives the carbon off, and you can incrementally do that to drill deep into the diamond.\"This shows the process of making a hollow cylinder out of a block of diamond. The diamond spins while a laser beam burns off its outer layers and its interior. Credit: Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyThe diamond emerges from the machining process with a black coating of pure graphite, but the MIT researchers found that this could be eliminated by heating the rotor overnight at about 600\u00b0C (about 1,100\u00b0F.) The result is a rotor that can already spin at 6 million revolutions per minute, the speed of the best zirconia rotors, and has other advantageous characteristics as well, including extremely high thermal conductivity and radio-frequency transparency.Fredin points out that all the parts needed to make this high-precision machining system \"were all designed and fabricated right here\" in a basement lab in the Center for Bits and Atoms. \"To be able to physically design and make everything and iterate it many times a day in-house was a crucial aspect of this project, as opposed to having to send things out to outside machine shops.\"Achieving much higher spinning frequencies should now be possible with these new rotors, the researchers say, but will require the development of new bearings and new systems based on helium rather than nitrogen to drive the rotation, in order to achieve the increased speeds and the corresponding leap in resolution. \"It was never worth it to develop these helium-compatible bearings for these small rotors until this technology was proven out, when the rotors previously used would not be able to withstand the spinning speeds,\" which could end up going as high as 20 million revolutions per minute, Golota says.Such high rotation rates are almost unheard of outside the NMR field. Preiss says that as a mechanical engineer, \"it's rare that you'd encounter something spinning above tens of thousands of rpm.\" When he first heard the 6 million rpm figure for these devices, he says, \"I kind of thought it was a joke.\"Because of these high speeds, Gershenfeld says, instabilities can easily arise from any imperfection: \"If there's even a slight asymmetry in the structure, at these frequencies, you're doomed.\"Golota says that in her experiments using current zirconia rotors, \"when the rotors fail, they explode, and you essentially just recover dust. But when the diamond rotors fail, we were able to recover them intact. So, you're saving the sample as well, which can be an invaluable resource to the user.\"                A microscope view of a tube-shaped diamond rotor seen from one end, showing the precise round shape and perfectly aligned central opening. Because the rotors spin at such high speeds, Neil Gershenfeld says, instabilities can easily arise from any imperfection. \"If there's even a slight asymmetry in the structure, at these frequencies, you're doomed.\" Credit: Massachusetts Institute of Technology             They have already used the new diamond rotor to produce the carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 spectra of a small peptide, clearly demonstrating the capabilities of the new diamond rotor material, which Griffin says is the first new material for such rotors to be developed in the last three decades. \"We've used spectra like these extensively,\" he says, \"to determine the structure of amyloid-beta 1-42, which is a toxic species in Alzheimer's disease.\"Samples of such material are hard to get and usually obtainable only in tiny quantities, he says. \"We now have a small rotor that's going to be hopefully very reliable where you can put in two or three milligrams of material and get spectral data like these,\" he says, pointing to the sample data they obtained. \"It's really exciting and it's going to open up a lot of new areas of research.\"This work \"is truly remarkable,\" says David Doty, president of Doty Scientific, a maker of NMR systems, who was not involved in this work. \"It would have been very hard to find anyone outside this group who would have thought it possible to laser machine diamond rotors with the precision needed for fast-MAS, prior to actually seeing it work,\" he says.Doty adds, \"What they have demonstrated thus far \u2026 is nothing short of amazing. If the additional needed progress can be made, hundreds of NMR researchers will want these to help them get better data for the projects they are working on, from improving our understanding of some diseases and developing better drugs to developing advanced battery materials.\"\"This new technology has the potential to be a game-changer in the way we will carry out solid-state NMR experiments in the future, opening unprecedented experimental opportunities in terms of resolution and sensitivity,\" says Anne Lesage, adjunct director of the institute of analytical sciences at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Lyon, France, who also was not associated with this work.

  "text": "Researchers in Japan have developed a machine learning process that simultaneously designs new molecules and suggests the chemical reactions needed to make them. The team at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM) in Tokyo published their results in the journal Science and Technology of Advanced Materials: Methods.          Many research groups are making significant progress in using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods to design feasible molecular structures with desired properties, but progress in putting the design concepts into practice has been slow. The greatest impediment has been the technical difficulties in finding chemical reactions that can make the designed molecules with efficiencies and costs that could be practicable for real-world uses.\"Our novel machine learning algorithm and associated software system can design molecules with any desired properties and suggest synthetic routes for making them from an extensive list of commercially available compounds,\" says statistical mathematician Ryo Yoshida, leader of the research group.The process uses a statistical approach called Bayesian inference, which works with a vast set of data about different options for starting materials and reaction pathways. The possible starting materials are all combinations of the millions of compounds that can be readily purchased. The computer algorithm assesses the huge range of feasible reactions and reaction networks to discover a synthetic route towards a compound with the properties it has been instructed to aim for. Expert chemists can then review the results to test and refine what the AI proposes. AI makes the suggestions while humans decide which is best.\"In a case study for designing drug-like molecules, the method showed overwhelming performance,\" says Yoshida. It also designed routes towards industrially useful lubricant molecules.\"We hope that our work will accelerate the process of data-driven discovery of a wide range of new materials,\" Yoshida concludes. In support of this aim, the ISM team has made the software implementing their machine learning system available to all researchers on the GitHub website.The current success focused only on the design of small molecules. The team now plan to investigate adapting the procedure to design polymers. Many of the most important industrial and biological compounds are polymers, but it has proved difficult to make new versions proposed by machine learning due to challenges in finding reactions to build the designs. The simultaneous design and reaction discovery options offered by this new technology might break through that barrier.

  "text": "A team of researchers at Duke University and their collaborators have uncovered the atomic mechanisms that make a class of compounds called argyrodites attractive candidates for both solid-state battery electrolytes and thermoelectric energy converters.          The discoveries\u2014and the machine learning approach used to make them\u2014could help usher in a new era of energy storage for applications such as household battery walls and fast-charging electric vehicles.The results appeared online May 18 in the journal Nature Materials.\"This is a puzzle that has not been cracked before because of how big and complex each building block of the material is,\" said Olivier Delaire, associate professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke. \"We've teased out the mechanisms at the atomic level that are causing this entire class of materials to be a hot topic in the field of solid-state battery innovation.\"As the world moves toward a future built on renewable energy, researchers must develop new technologies for storing and distributing energy to homes and electric vehicles. While the standard bearer to this point has been the lithium-ion battery containing liquid electrolytes, it is far from an ideal solution given its relatively low efficiency and the liquid electrolyte's affinity for occasionally catching fire and exploding.These limitations stem primarily from the chemically reactive liquid electrolytes inside Li-ion batteries that allow lithium ions to move relatively unencumbered between electrodes. While great for moving electric charges, the liquid component makes them sensitive to high temperatures that can cause degradation and, eventually, a runaway thermal catastrophe.Many public and private research labs are spending a lot of time and money to develop alternative solid-state batteries out of a variety of materials. If engineered correctly, this approach offers a much safer and more stable device with a higher energy density\u2014at least in theory.While nobody has yet discovered a commercially viable approach to solid-state batteries, one of the leading contenders relies on a class of compounds called argyrodites, named after a silver containing mineral. These compounds are built from specific, stable crystalline frameworks made of two elements with a third free to move about the chemical structure. While some recipes such as silver, germanium and sulfur are naturally occurring, the general framework is flexible enough for researchers to create a wide array of combinations.      \"Every electric vehicle manufacturer is trying to move to new solid-state battery designs, but none of them are disclosing which compositions they're betting on,\" Delaire said. \"Winning that race would be a game changer because cars could charge faster, last longer and be safer all at once.\"In the new paper, Delaire and his colleagues look at one promising candidate made of silver, tin and selenium (Ag8SnSe6). Using a combination of neutrons and X-rays, the researchers bounced these extremely fast-moving particles off atoms within samples of Ag8SnSe6 to reveal its molecular behavior in real-time. Team member Mayanak Gupta, a former postdoc in Delaire's lab who is now a researcher at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in India, also developed a machine learning approach to make sense of the data and created a computational model to match the observations using first-principles quantum mechanical simulations.The results showed that while the tin and selenium atoms created a relatively stable scaffolding, it was far from static. The crystalline structure constantly flexes to create windows and channels for the charged silver ions to move freely through the material. The system, Delaire said, is like the tin and selenium lattices remain solid while the silver is in an almost liquid-like state.\"It's sort of like the silver atoms are marbles rattling around about the bottom of a very shallow well, moving about like the crystalline scaffold isn't solid,\" Delaire said. \"That duality of a material living between both a liquid and solid state is what I found most surprising.\"The results and, perhaps more importantly, the approach combining advanced experimental spectroscopy with machine learning, should help researchers make faster progress toward replacing lithium-ion batteries in many crucial applications. According to Delaire, this study is just one of a suite of projects aimed at a variety of promising argyrodite compounds comprising different recipes. One combination that replaces the silver with lithium is of particular interest to the group, given its potential for EV batteries.\"Many of these materials offer very fast conduction for batteries while being good heat insulators for thermoelectric converters, so we're systematically looking at the entire family of compounds,\" Delaire said. \"This study serves to benchmark our machine learning approach that has enabled tremendous advances in our ability to simulate these materials in only a couple of years. I believe this will allow us to quickly simulate new compounds virtually to find the best recipes these compounds have to offer.\" More information:Qingyong Ren et al, Extreme phonon anharmonicity underpins superionic diffusion and ultralow thermal conductivity in argyrodite Ag8SnSe6, Nature Materials (2023).

  "text": "Scientists have long been challenged by the complex process of drug discovery and development, with investments that often go unrewarded. However, with the advancement of experimental technology and computer hardware, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a leading tool in analyzing abundant and high-dimensional data.          In a new academic paper published in the journal Engineering titled \"Artificial Intelligence in Pharmaceutical Sciences,\" researchers detail the advantages of AI technology in all aspects of new drug research and development (R&D).AI is capable of discovering new drugs more efficiently and at a lower cost. Through the explosive growth of biomedical data, AI has led to a revolution in drug R&D, from target discovery to preclinical research, automated drug synthesis, and influences on the pharmaceutical market. In the review, the authors provide a brief overview of common AI models in the field of drug discovery, then summarize and discuss in depth their specific applications in various stages of drug R&D.The paper concludes that AI is advantageous in all aspects of new drug R&D. It can be used in the discovery of drug targets, the design and development of new drugs, preclinical research, clinical trial design, and post-market surveillance to assist in the design of safe and effective drugs.AI greatly reduces the cycle time and cost of drug R&D. While some limitations still remain in the AI-based drug R&D process, the authors believe that AI is an indispensable technology in the drug R&D process. In the future, AI technologies will change the R&D paradigm of pharmaceutical sciences, providing personalized medicine to patients.The authors of the paper propose further research to inject new energy into this field and keep the momentum going. The emergence of AI is gradually helping scientists unravel the mystery of large and complex biological systems, making it a game-changer in the drug R&D process. As technology continues to advance, the potential of AI in the pharmaceutical industry is limitless.

  "answer_race": " To introduce a research on Lyme disease.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the bacteria that causes Lyme disease?",
  "answer_squad": " Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato",
  "text": "Approximately one in three ticks in Estonia and up to one in four in Tallinn carry bacteria that cause borreliosis. Scientists of TalTech are investigating whether medicinal plants growing in Estonia could be used to fight Lyme disease and destroy the bacteria causing it.          The arrival of warmer weather and more people spending time outdoors bring risks that should be addressed. A tick, likely to be carrying at least one pathogen, can attach itself to human skin in natural areas. The abundance of ticks in Estonia and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens have increased significantly in the last decade.The results of the recently published National Institute for Health Development project 'Mail a Tick!' show that, of the six main viruses/bacteria included in the study, at least one pathogen was detected in 62.3% of all ticks examined. The better-known tick-borne diseases include tick-borne encephalitis and borreliosis.More and more causes of Lyme diseaseIt is possible to be vaccinated against encephalitis as a viral disease; moreover, immunity develops as a result of contracting the disease. There is no preventive treatment for Lyme disease. Once infected, there is no immunity and the consequences can be severe. Lyme disease is caused by a group of bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which enter human bloodstream through tick bites.The first sign of infection is an enlarging reddish patch around the bite site, but this is absent in as many as a third of cases. According to scientific articles published in many scientific journals, such as Frontiers in Neurology, Pain, The Lancet, and Clinical Microbiology and Infection, symptoms in the later stages of the disease can include damage to joints, nervous system, skin, and heart.According to the National Institute of Health, approximately 28% of Estonian ticks are carriers of B. burgdorferi and more than 2,500 people are infected with Lyme disease each year. A comparison of the latest data with the results of surveys conducted in 2006\u20132009 and 2012\u20132014 shows that the prevalence of Lyme disease in ticks has increased two or three times in some places across Estonia.It is important to know that tick-borne diseases can also be contracted in the cities. The 2018 National Institute for Health Development survey of green areas in the capital city showed that an average 35% of ticks collected from urban areas carried at least one pathogen, with the prevalence of bacteria causing Lyme disease being as high as 25% of ticks in some places.      Innovative treatments are neededLyme disease is treated with antibiotics, which are generally effective in the acute stage of the disease. However, if the disease goes unnoticed and treatment is delayed, it can develop into a chronic condition.Persistent symptoms are caused by the more resistant forms of B. burgdorferi bacteria, namely round body forms and biofilm, which are not as sensitive to antibiotics as the bacteria in their original form\u2014corkscrew-shaped, or individual spirochetes.Novel treatments are needed to fight resistant forms of bacteria. There are many examples in research literature of the efficacy of various plant-derived compounds or phytochemicals against Lyme disease.The instrumental analysis research group of TalTech has been involved in the research of Estonian plants for a long time, and the main goal of the group in recent years has been identifying phytochemicals that are effective against B. burgdorferi and discovering new lead compounds suitable for the treatment of chronic Lyme disease.Although many Estonian plants are known as medicinal herbs with antibacterial properties, the alleged beneficial properties are often unconfirmed by scientific methods. The chemical study of Estonian plants allows identifying specific plant compounds responsible for different therapeutic properties.                Plantago lanceolata is one of the plants expected to contain phytochemicals with antibacterial properties. Credit: Pille-Riin Laanet and Merike Vaher             Which plants are studied by chemists?The instrumental analysis research group is working on a wide range of plants growing in Estonia that are more or less known as medicinal plants. As a result of the research, an overview of the chemical composition and beneficial properties of many local plant extracts will be available. The first part of the plant research focuses on the chemical characterization of the studied species, the identification of the main groups of compounds present in them, and the antioxidant properties of plant extracts.Antioxidant activity of an extract suggests its potential therapeutic uses both as an antibacterial agent and in the treatment of diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as cancers. With a suitable solvent and extraction protocol, it is possible to isolate compounds with antibacterial properties from plants, from which the researchers hope to identify the ones suitable for the treatment of Lyme disease.A detailed summary of this work can be found in a recent article published in the special issue of Molecules, which describes the identification and characterization of phytochemicals found in various Galium species growing in Estonia.Extracts of Galium verum, Galium aparine, and Galium mollugo were found to have significant antioxidant properties. The main compounds identified in the extracts belonged in the polyphenol and iridoid classes. Representatives of these classes of substances have shown a wide range of beneficial therapeutic properties in many previous scientific studies.Polyphenols are known both for the prevention and treatment of diseases related to oxidative stress and iridoids for their anti-inflammatory properties and as inhibitors of bacterial, viral, and fungal growth. An extract made from Galium verum flowers was found to have the strongest antioxidant properties. In addition, volatile compounds in Estonian Galium species were identified, of which phytochemicals found in all three plant species have been previously confirmed as inhibitors of bacterial and fungal growth.The beneficial properties of Dipsacus fullonum L. are confirmedThe research team has successfully confirmed the anti-Borrelia properties of another plant growing in Estonia, the Dipsakus fullonum L. The results of this research were published last year in a special issue of the journal Pharmaceuticals and were recognized for their importance in this field. Iridoid-glycoside fraction was isolated from the extract of the Dipsacus fullonum L. plant, which showed high activity against Borrelia and a low risk to mammalian cells.As compounds with activity against Borrelia account for about 15% of the total extract, the leaves of Dipsacus fullonum L. are an excellent natural source for extracting novel lead compounds for the treatment of Lyme disease.Plantagos and honey are also examinedScientists of the instrumental analysis research group of TalTech Merike Vaher, Piret Saar-Reismaa, Pille-Riin Laanet, Piia J\u00f5ul, and Olga Bragina will continue their work on the chemical characterization of Estonian plants and the development of suitable extraction methods for compounds with therapeutic potential.Among other things, the activity of various Plantagos and of various types of Estonian honeys and pollen against Borrelia is currently being investigated and ongoing trials have shown promising results in both cases. The researchers of TalTech hope that the results of the research could point to new treatment options for doctors and their patients, and pave the way for clinical trials to help people with chronic Lyme disease.

  "text": "A new paper published in Energy Material Advances explores Eu3+-Bi3+ codoping double perovskites for single-component white-light-emitting diodes.          \"With lead-halide perovskites reaching a mature research stage approaching product marketing, concerns remain about the materials' stability and the toxicity of lead-based salts,\" said paper author Hongwei Song, professor at College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Jilin University.Double perovskites with Cs2AgInCl6 composition, often doped with various elements, have been in the spotlight owing to their intriguing optical properties, namely, self-trapped exciton (STEs) emission and dopant-induced photoluminescence. This interest has sparked different synthesis approaches towards both crystals and nanocrystals, and the exploration of many alloy compositions with mono- and trivalent cations other than Ag+ and In3+.Song explained that, in the development of lead-free perovskite materials, people's first thought is to replace Pb element with a non-toxic element. In order to replace Pb in halide perovskite, researchers chose several low-toxic cations in the same period closest to it, such as Sn, Ge, Bi, Sb, In, etc., because they have a similar inactive shell s orbital.This is the key to the unique photoelectric properties of perovskite materials. Lead-based perovskite materials have attracted great attentions in solid-state lighting area due to their high efficiency, high color rendering and tunable luminescence performance. This is both an opportunity and a challenge for the overall development of the photoelectric industry.\"Since the pioneering work on Cs2AgInCl6 in 2017 reported by Giustino et al. and Zhou et al. nearly simultaneously, many efforts have been devoted to its synthesis, modification of its composition, study of its electronic structure, optoelectronic properties, and applications. Recently, a record of white light emission with 86 % PLQY was achieved by Luo et al. via simultaneous alloying of Ag+ with Na+ and Bi3+ doping, marking an important milestone in the development of Cs2AgInCl6 related materials,\" Song said.      \"Despite several advantages, major issues with these lead halide perovskites remain their poor stability and toxicity. In order to solve such problems, various attempts have been made to reduce the toxicity of perovskites while still maintaining their efficient optical properties.\"The existence of Bi3+ ions decrease the excitation (absorption) energy, provides a new absorption channel and increases the energy transfer rate to Eu3+ ions. Through adjusting the Bi3+ and Eu3+ concentrations, a maximum photoluminescence efficiency (PLQY) of 80.1% is obtained in 6% Eu3+ and 0.5% Bi3+ co-doped Cs2AgInCl6 DPs.\"The energy transfer efficiency can be fitted with the decay rates under different Bi3+ doping concentrations. It can be seen that the energy transfer rate improves as a whole with the increase of the doping concentration of Bi3+, and the optimum energy transfer rate corresponding to the Bi3+ concentration is 0.5%. Next, we conducted PLQY test on the materials. For the undoped Cs2AgInCl6 DPs, PLQY is only 0.5%, which dramatically increases to 20.1% after the addition of Bi3+. After [being] co-doped with Eu3+ and Bi3+ ions, PLQY continues to increase, and reaches the maximum of 80.1% when the Eu concentration reaches 6%,\" Song said.\"Here, we propose a possible mechanism to describe Eu3+ emission in Bi/Eu3+: Cs2AgInCl6. Cs2AgInCl6 DP is a direct bandgap semiconductor. Bi3+ doping provides a new absorption channel for the material, which may be caused by the contribution of the Bi3+ orbital in the band edge, breaking the STE-state compatibility ban transition, generating a new light absorption channel at a lower energy, and promoting the PLQY emitted by STE. For the Eu3+emission, we think there are two pathways. First, the energy transfer from STE to Eu3+ ions is possible as we have observed the Eu3+ emission in the Eu3+ doped Cs2AgInCl6 DPs. Second, the Eu3+ emission may mainly come from the energy transfer from Bi3+ ions to Eu3+ ions. The Bi3+ ions absorb the excitation light and transfer the energy from 1P1, 3P2, 3P1, 3P0 levels of Bi3+ ions to 5D3, 5D2, 5D1 and 5D0 levels of Eu3+ ions. The characteristic emission of Eu3+ ions is then formed through 5D0\u21927Fj(j=0,1,2,3) transitions.\"\"Finally, we prepared the white light emitting diodes based on Bi3+ and Eu3+ codoped Cs2AgInCl6 DPs were fabricated with the optimum color rendering index of 89, the optimal luminous efficiency of 88.1 lm/W and a half-lifetime of 1493 h. This strategy of imparting optical functions to metal halide DPs may lead to future applications, such as optical fiber communications, daily lighting, military industry, displays, and other fields,\" Song said.

  "text": "Most states in the U.S. allow people to use cannabis for medical or recreational purposes. Yet all states want their roadways to be safe. A breathalyzer that can accurately identify people who recently smoked cannabis might help them keep impaired drivers off the road\u2014if such a device existed.          But developing a breathalyzer for cannabis is far more difficult than for alcohol, which people exhale in large amounts when drinking. In contrast, the intoxicating component of cannabis, called THC, is thought to be carried inside aerosol particles that people exhale. The total volume of aerosols can be very small, making it difficult to accurately measure their THC content. Currently, there is no standard method for doing this.Now, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Colorado Boulder have conducted a study in which they collected breath samples from people both before and after they smoked high-THC cannabis, aka marijuana, and used laboratory instruments (not a handheld device) to measure the amount of THC in their breath.The goal of this study, published in the Journal of Breath Research, was to begin developing a protocol that yields reproducible results\u2014a necessary step toward a reliable, validated field-based method.The samples collected before people smoked were important because THC can persist in the bodies of people who frequently use cannabis for a month or more, long after the effects of the drug have worn off.\"One key question that we cannot yet answer is whether breath measurements can be used to distinguish between a person who uses cannabis regularly but hasn't done so lately, and someone who consumed an hour ago,\" said NIST supervisory chemical engineer and study author Tara Lovestead. \"Having a reproducible protocol for breath measurements will help us and other researchers answer that question.\"NIST scientists conduct foundational research on measuring THC and related compounds in the breath of people who have smoked cannabis. Their research shows that a lot of work remains before a reliable cannabis breathalyzer can be developed. Credit: National Institute of Standards and TechnologyThe breath samples were collected in a mobile lab\u2014a comfortably appointed white van that would park conveniently outside participants' homes. This mobile pharmacology lab was developed by researchers at University of Colorado Boulder, including Cinnamon Bidwell, an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience and a co-author of the study.      In addition, all participants purchased and used a consistent kind of high-THC cannabis prepared by a licensed dispensary in Boulder, Colorado. This study design allowed the authors to conduct their research without handling high-THC cannabis or otherwise running afoul of federal laws.At the appointed time, participants popped into the van, gave their pre-use breath sample and also provided a blood sample. They then went back into their residence, smoked cannabis according to their usual custom and returned immediately to the van to provide a second blood sample. Since THC concentrations in blood spike immediately after consuming the drug, researchers compared the before-and-after blood samples to confirm that the participants had in fact just used it. An hour later, the participants gave their second breath sample.Participants provided breath samples by blowing into a tube containing an \"impaction filter\" that captured aerosols from their breath. Later in the lab, the researchers extracted the material caught in the filter and measured the concentration of THC and other cannabis compounds using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, a laboratory technique that identifies compounds and measures their amount.Because this was a protocol development study that involved only 18 participants, the results of the analysis do not carry statistical weight. However, they do highlight the need for further study.\"We expected to see higher THC concentrations in the breath samples collected an hour after people used,\" Lovestead said. However, THC levels spanned a similar range across pre-use and post-use samples. \"In many cases, we would not have been able to tell whether the person smoked within the last hour based on the concentration of THC in their breath.\"\"A lot more research is needed to show that a cannabis breathalyzer can produce useful results,\" said NIST materials research engineer and co-author Kavita Jeerage. \"A breathalyzer test can have a huge impact on a person's life, so people should have confidence that the results are accurate.\" More information:Kavita M Jeerage et al, THC in breath aerosols collected with an impaction filter device before and after legal-market product inhalation\u2014a pilot study, Journal of Breath Research (2023).

  "text": "For pharmaceuticals, knowing the chemical composition is not enough\u2014molecular geometry and crystal structure also play an important role in a drug's activity. By using a method based on electron diffraction, it has now been possible for a research team to determine the structure of Levocetirizine, as reported in the journal Angewandte Chemie. The advantage of this technique is that, unlike for X-ray crystallography, nanoscale crystals are sufficient.          Despite being chemically identical, many pharmaceutical substances may adopt different crystal structures or form cocrystals with an additive. This can significantly influence the properties of a drug, such as bioavailability, solubility, stability, and tabletability. Structural determinations are correspondingly important in the development of advanced solid pharmaceuticals.Today, the standard and routine method for determining the three-dimensional structures of crystalline molecules and biological macromolecules with atomic resolution is single-crystal X-ray diffraction structure analysis (SCXRD). The atoms within the crystal diffract the X-ray radiation, forming a diffraction pattern from which the positions of the individual atoms in the structure of the crystal can be calculated. This requires sufficiently large, well-diffracting single crystals.However, many compounds are difficult or impossible to crystallize. An alternative method is powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), which can analyze a sample in the form of a powder. However, the data analysis is not straightforward and if the sample is a mixture of several phases of the same or different compounds, it is very difficult and often ambiguous.A more recent technique is 3D-electron diffraction/micro-crystal diffraction (3D ED/MicroED). Instead of X-rays, electron beams from an electron microscope are diffracted. Because the interaction of matter with electrons is significantly stronger than interactions with X-rays, sub-micro to nanometer-sized crystals produce diffraction patterns that can be evaluated and direct analysis of components in microcrystalline mixtures becomes possible.A team led by Durga Prasad Karothu and Pan\u010de Naumov has used 3D ED/MicroED to determine the structure of Levocetirizine dihydrochloride. Levocetirizine is an over-the-counter oral antihistamine used to treat allergy symptoms such as hay fever and hives. Although it has been in broad use, its crystal structure has remained unknown because no crystals good enough for X-ray crystallographic analysis could be grown. Recently, the structure of this medication was studied using powder X-ray diffraction and computer calculations\u2014but uncertainty and ambiguity remained.The team at New York University Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates), Rigaku Europe SE (Neu-Isenburg, Germany), and New York University (New York, U.S.) worked with crystals obtained by grinding commercially available tablets. In addition to determining the drug's crystal structure, they were able to use a special evaluation process (dynamical refinement) to unambiguously determine the absolute configuration (the exact spatial arrangement of all atoms within the molecule) of Levocetirizine.

  "text": "How short is one second? The duration of a second can be defined as one 86,400th of a 24-hour day. A bullet train traveling at 300 km per hour can cover a distance of 83 meters in one second. On average, an individual's blink lasts for 0.3 seconds, allowing for three blinks to occur within one second. A joint team of researchers from POSTECH has proposed a synthesis method for fluorine-based compound via a rapid mixing reaction between a gaseous component and liquid that takes less than a single second.          The research team led by Professor Dong-Pyo Kim and Jeong-Un Joo (Department of Chemical Engineering at POSTECH), and Professor Heejin Kim and Hyune-Jea Lee (currently, a researcher at Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology) from the Department of Chemistry at Korea University has successfully developed a new method for synthesizing trifluoromethyl intermediate (-CF3) from fluoroform (CHF3).It involves the use of a special reactor capable of achieving an ultra-fast mixing between gas and liquid. This method offers promising prospects for the synthesis of novel fluorine-based new drugs. The research was published in Nature Communications.Fluorine is not found in its pure form naturally, but instead exists solely in the form of various chemical compounds. Sodium fluoride, a compound containing fluorine, is used as an ingredient in toothpaste due to its ability to coat teeth and prevent cavities.Recent studies have highlighted the potential of synthetic drug molecules containing fluorine as they possess high permeability into cell membranes of diseased tissues and exhibit strong binding affinity against proteins. Consequently, there is growing interest in the development of drugs containing fluorine.There are several approaches to synthesizing trifluoromethyl, but the most cost-effective method involves substituting a hydrogen atom from fluoroform, a simple precursor, with another element or functional group. However, gaseous fluoroform is volatile, which makes it difficult to mix with liquids and exhibits low reactivity. Moreover, it decomposes instantly, requiring the addition of a substance that can react with it. Unfortunately, this process can result in unintended chemical reactions that lead to a low yield of trifluoromethyl.To address the challenge of synthesizing trifluoromethyl from fluoroform, the research team developed a novel gas-liquid reactor with a zigzag-shaped channel and highly permeable non-porous membranes sandwiched between upper and lower channels. This configuration allowed for the swirling and mixing of superbase, a liquid utilized for dehydrogenation, and gaseous fluoroform within the reactor.By breaking fluoroform bubbles into smaller pieces to increase the contact area between gas and liquid, the team was able to effectively produce trifluoromethyl anion (CF3-). Unlike traditional approaches, they produced a fluoride intermediate effectively without requiring stabilizers or additives.The research team synthesized a fluorine-based compound by immediately adding a compound that will react with the fluoride anion intermediate. The entire process, which involved the generation of a fluorine anion intermediate from fluoroform took place within a second. The team maximized the formation of a trifluoromethyl anion, which is known to be short-lived, and rapidly facilitated the subsequent reaction before the intermediate decomposed.This method allowed for improved yield of fluoride-based compounds and introduced a robust technique for the synthesis of fluorine-based drugs.The research findings have significant implications for industrial applications in the economically efficient synthesis of fluoride compounds, making them more practical as well contributing significantly to studies on several unstable intermediates.

  "answer_squad": " Collagen",
  "text": "Collagen is the protein that holds our body together. It is produced inside cells, from where it must be transported to its site of action in connective tissue. The protein domain that is responsible for the recognition of collagen has previously been mistaken for a subform of another.          Dr. Oliver Arnolds and Professor Raphael Stoll from the Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, have characterized and named this domain for the first time. They reported on the so-called MOTH domain of the TANGO1 protein family in the journal Nature Communications on April 20, 2023.How collagen reaches its site of actionAlmost all organisms that have more than one cell require collagen to hold their bodies together. In some mammals, it accounts for up to 30% of body weight. Collagen is a huge protein that is produced in the so-called endoplasmic reticulum, an organelle inside cells. It then has to be exported from the organelle and from the cell, because it is needed in the space between the cells in the connective tissue.A family of proteins known as TANGO1 is responsible for identifying and transporting the collagen. Made up of more than 1,000 amino acids, these proteins are very large indeed. TANGO1 proteins sometimes spread across various cell organelles and the cytoplasm. When the TANGO1 protein detects a maturating collagen, it supports the formation of a tunnel-like lipid connection that transports the collagen from its place of manufacture to its site of action.A distinct structureIn order to perform these mechanisms, TANGO1 has a specific domain, i.e., a functional area with a defined 3D structure. \"Up to now, we have assumed that this domain is similar to the so-called SH3 structure and regarded it as a substructure,\" says Raphael Stoll.In the current study, however, he and Oliver Arnolds demonstrated by means of NMR spectroscopy that there are structural differences between the collagen-recognition domain of TANGO1 and the canonical SH3 domain. These differences are so significant in terms of biochemistry that they warrant referring to this TANGO1 domain as a separate structure. Hence, they named this collagen-recognizing domain MOTH. \"The name is an acronym for the total of four proteins that adopt exactly this structure: MIA, Otoraplin, TALI/TANGO1 homology,\" explains Raphael Stoll.The discovery of the MOTH domain provides insights into evolution, because both vertebrates and invertebrates such as insects need collagen. \"The MOTH domain is very old in evolutionary terms, approximately several hundred million years,\" points out Raphael Stoll.However, as invertebrates separated from vertebrates, the domain changed during evolution. \"We assume that this process has coincided with the evolution of several different collagens. While insects have only one collagen, humans are found to have 28 different variations of it. These findings help improve our understanding of the collagen export process and could prove useful in future drug developments for fibrosis,\" concludes Stoll.

  "text": "Chemical engineers at Monash University have developed an industrial process to produce acetic acid that uses the excess carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and has a potential to create negative carbon emissions.          Acetic acid is an important chemical used in several industrial processes and is an ingredient in household vinegar, vinyl paints and some glues. Worldwide industrial demand for acetic acid is estimated to be 6.5 million tons per year.This world-first research, published in Nature Communications, shows that acetic acid can be made from captured CO2 using an economical solid catalyst to replace the liquid rhodium or iridium based catalysts currently used.Liquid catalysts require additional separation and purification processes. Using a solid catalyst made from a production method that doesn't require further processing also reduces emissions.Lead researcher Associate Professor Akshat Tanksale said the research could be a widely adopted practice for industry. \"CO2 is over abundant in the atmosphere, and the main cause of global warming and climate change. Even if we stopped all the industrial emissions today, we would continue to see negative impacts of global warming for at least a thousand years as nature slowly balances the excess CO2,\" Prof. Tanksale said.\"There is an urgent need to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere and convert it into products that do not release the captured CO2 back into the atmosphere. Our team is focused on creating a novel industrially relevant method, which can be applied at the large scale required to encourage negative emissions.\"The research team first created a class of material called the metal organic framework (MOF) which is a highly crystalline substance made of repeating units of iron atoms connected with organic bridges.They then heated the MOF in a controlled environment to break those bridges, allowing iron atoms to come together and form particles of a few nanometers in size.These iron nanoparticles are embedded in a porous carbon layer, making them highly active while remaining stable in the harsh reaction conditions. This is the first time an iron based catalyst has been reported for making acetic acid.From an industrial point of view, the new process will be more efficient and cost effective. From an environmental perspective, the research offers an opportunity to significantly improve current manufacturing processes that pollute the environment.This means a solution to slow down or potentially reverse climate change while providing economic benefits to the industry from the sales of acetic acid products.The researchers are currently in the process of developing the process for commercialization in collaboration with their industry partners as part of the Australian Research Council (ARC) Research Hub for Carbon Utilization and Recycling.

  "text": "The nucleobase molecules carrying the genetic codes are the most important ingredients for life, but they are also very vulnerable. When the ultraviolet component in the sunlight irradiates these molecules, the electrons in the molecules will be excited, and the excited nucleobase molecules may result in irreversible changes or even damages to the DNA and RNA chains, leading to the \"sunburn\" of organisms at molecular level.          It is widely believed that there is a \"sunscreen\" mechanism in these nucleobase molecules which can lead to rapid decay into the ground state. The ultrafast decay mechanism for most types of nucleobases has been confirmed. However, the research team of Professor Todd Martinez at Stanford University proposed that there may be a shallow potential barrier for the excited electronic state of uracil (U) nucleobase, which hinders the decay of excited molecules.This can be understood as a trick reserved by nature to promote biological variation and evolution.This novel point of view has caused wide controversy and discussion. There are many different kinds of theoretical models about whether there is indeed a hindrance to the decay of excited state uracil. In this article, using ultrashort electron pulses and X-ray free electron lasers, the research led by Professor Zheng Li and Professor Haitan Xu provides a detailed theoretical analysis of an experimental scheme that incorporates multiple signals of ultrafast electron and X-ray diffraction and X-ray spectroscopy, and opens a way to resolve this interesting controversy.There are currently three hypotheses about the decay time scale of photoexcited uracil nucleobase. In 2007, the group of Todd Martinez proposed that the decay time of photoexcited uracil may be much longer than other nucleobases, reaching more than 1 picosecond, because the shallow potential barrier for the uracil excited state hinders the decay process.In 2009, the research group of Zhenggang Lan from the Max Planck Institute proposed that the decay of the uracil base would not pass through the potential barrier. This theoretical model predicts short decay time of photoexcited uracil, which is about 70 femtoseconds.In 2011, the research group of Pavel Hobza from the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences proposed the intermediate trajectory hypothesis, in which the uracil may have another way of structural relaxation, and the decay time through this path takes about 0.7 ps. Because the predicted potential barrier in the uracil excited state is very shallow, and due to the precision limit of quantum chemical calculations, different theoretical hypotheses give contradictory predictions of electronic decay pathways.      The authors propose an approach which can uniquely identify the electronic decay mechanism of the photoexcited uracil with ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy (XPS), ultrafast X-ray diffraction (UXD), and ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) methods. Incorporating the signatures of multiple probing methods, the authors demonstrate an approach that can identify the geometric and electronic relaxation characteristic time scales of the photoexcited uracil molecule among several candidate models.The XPS signal provides the toolkit to map out the valence electron density variation in the chosen atomic sites of molecules. X-ray can ionize core electrons of molecules, and the shift of photoelectron energy in XPS in the molecule reflects the strength of electron screening effect of nuclear charge, which maps out the local density of valence electrons at the specific atom. Ultrafast diffraction imaging has been widely used to resolve the molecular structural dynamics.UED is capable of characterizing the correlation between electrons and can be used to monitor the electronic population transfer dynamics. Compared to UED, UXD can resolve the transient geometric structure with higher temporal precision, which is free of pulse length limitation of UED because of space charge effect of electron bunch compression.Combining the above signals of multiple experimental results, the characteristic time scales of geometric and electronic relaxation can be obtained, and the decay pathway of photoexcited uracil molecule can be identified.The authors have performed molecular dynamics simulations following the long trajectory hypothesis, and calculated the ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy and coherent diffraction imaging signals. In the long trajectory hypothesis, the uracil molecule first relaxes into minimum energy geometry in the S2 state and then decays to S1 state.The structural and electronic transition dynamics during the decay of uracil nucleobases can be reflected by XPS signal. Choosing the carbon K-edge for the X-ray probe, the variation of XPS signal in corresponding energy range is fitted, and two relaxation time scales (about 3.5 ps and 0.2 ps) are obtained.These two characteristic time scales are related to the molecular structural evolution and electronic state transition dynamics, but the exact determination of the time scales requires combining analysis of coherent diffraction imaging, because the information of structural and electronic evolutions are usually mixed in the XPS signal.UED is capable of characterizing the mean distance between electrons and can be used to detect the electronic population transfer dynamics. The calculated time-resolved electron diffraction signal based on molecular dynamics trajectories reflects 4.2 ps time scale of electronic state decay obtained by exponential fitting, which confirms that the 3.5 ps characteristic time scale of XPS is related to electronic transition dynamics.The pair distribution function reflecting the average distance between atoms is obtained by Fourier transformation of UXD signal, which shows that one of the C-C bond lengths in uracil molecule is elongated in about 0.2 ps after photoexcitation followed by relaxation into minimum energy geometry in the excited state.The time-frequency analysis of UXD signal by continuous wavelet transform reveals the frequencies of the dominant modes, and the 0.2 ps time scale of molecular structure evolution, which is consistent with the characteristic frequencies and 0.2 ps time scale of structural evolution obtained from XPS signal.It is shown that the characteristic time scales of geometric relaxation and electronic decay of uracil in the long trajectory model can be faithfully retrieved by incorporating time-resolved XPS, UED and UXD analyses.Incorporating the signatures of multiple probing methods, the authors demonstrate an approach to identify the decay pathway of photoexcited nucleobases among several candidate models. This study demonstrates the synergy of spectroscopic and coherent diffraction imaging with ultrafast time resolution, which can also serve as a general methodological toolkit for investigating electronic and structural dynamics in ultrafast photochemistry.The research is published in the journal Ultrafast Science.

  "text": "We know a lot about mosquito preferences up close, but how do mosquitoes find us from up to a hundred meters away? Using an ice-rink-sized outdoor testing arena in Zambia, researchers found that human body odor is critical for mosquito host-seeking behavior over long distances. The team also identified specific airborne body-odor components that might explain why some people are more attractive to mosquitoes than others. The work appears May 19 in the journal Current Biology.          Most studies of mosquito preference have been performed in confined laboratory settings that probably don't represent a mosquito's experience in the wild. To test how the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae locates and chooses human hosts over a large and more realistic spatial scale, researchers from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Malaria Research Institute and Macha Research Trust teamed up to build a 1,000 m3 testing arena in Choma District, Zambia.\"This is the largest system to assess olfactory preference for any mosquito in the world,\" says neuroscientist Diego Giraldo, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, one of the study's first authors. \"And it's a very busy sensory environment for the mosquitoes.\"The testing arena contained a ring of evenly spaced landing pads that were heated to human skin temperature (35\u00baC). Each night, the researchers released 200 hungry mosquitoes into the testing arena and monitored their activity using infrared motion cameras. Specifically, they took note of how often mosquitoes landed on each of the landing pads (which is a good sign that they're ready to bite).A video of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes landing on a heated pad that is baited with human body odor and illuminated by infrared LEDs. Credit: Diego GiraldoFirst, the team compared the relative importance of heat, CO2, and human body odor for attracting mosquitoes. They found that mosquitoes were not attracted to the heated landing pads unless they were also baited with CO2, but human body odor was a more attractive bait than CO2 alone.Next, the team tested the mosquitoes' choosiness. To do this, they had six people sleep in single-person tents surrounding the arena over six consecutive nights, and they used repurposed air conditioner ducting to pipe air from each tent\u2014containing the aromas of its sleeping occupant\u2014onto the heated landing pads. As well as recording the mosquitoes' preferences, the researchers collected nightly air samples from the tents to characterize and compare the airborne components of body odor.\"These mosquitoes typically hunt humans in the hours before and after midnight,\" says senior author and vector biologist Conor McMeniman, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute. \"They follow scent trails and convective currents emanating from humans, and typically they'll enter homes and bite between around 10 PM and 2 AM. We wanted to assess mosquito olfactory preferences during the peak period of activity when they're out and about and active and also assess the odor from sleeping humans during that same time window.\"      They found that, night after night, some people were more attractive to mosquitoes than others, and one of the volunteers, who had a strikingly different odor composition from the others, consistently attracted very few mosquitoes.The team identified 40 chemicals that were emitted by all of the humans, though at different rates. \"It's probably a ratio-specific blend that they're following,\" says analytical chemist Stephanie Rankin-Turner , a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the study's other first author. \"We don't really know yet exactly what aspect of skin secretions, microbial metabolites, or breath emissions are really driving this, but we're hoping we'll be able to figure that out in the coming years.\"Though each person's odor profile varied from night to night, the researchers found some stable patterns. People who were more attractive to mosquitoes consistently emitted more carboxylic acids, which are probably produced by skin microbes. In contrast, the person who was least attractive to mosquitoes emitted less carboxylic acids but approximately triple the amount of eucalyptol, a compound found in many plants; the researchers hypothesize that elevated levels of eucalyptol may be related to the person's diet.The researchers were surprised by how effectively the mosquitoes could locate and choose between potential human meals within the huge arena. \"When you see something moved from a tiny laboratory space where the odors are right there, and the mosquitoes are still finding them in this big open space out in a field in Zambia, it really drives home just how powerful these mosquitoes are as host seekers,\" says Rankin-Turner.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the iodide that can convert almost all absorbed energy into detectable light?",
  "answer_squad": " Cs3Cu2I5",
  "text": "Advanced electronic devices require high-quality materials such as metal halide phosphors that can effectively convert light into measurable signals. Toxic element-free copper-based iodides such as cesium copper iodide (Cs3Cu2I5: CCI) are particularly promising in this regard.          CCI is an efficient blue light-emitting material that can convert almost all the absorbed energy into detectable light, making them ideal for use in deep-UV photodetectors and \u03b3-ray scintillators for detecting ionizing radiation, such as gamma or X-rays. However, the thin films of CCI do not meet the required quality standards, hindering their performance improvement for advanced stacking applications.Now, a study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society has addressed this issue by proposing an innovative method for producing high-quality thin films of Cs3Cu2I5. The study was led by researchers from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), including Professor Hideo Hosono as the corresponding author and Specially Appointed Assistant Professor Masatake Tsuji as the first author.In an earlier experimental finding, the team had discovered that cesium iodide (CsI) and copper iodide (CuI) powders can react even at room temperature to form Cs3Cu2I5. Building on this insight, they deposited thin films of CuI and CsI onto a silica substrate by evaporating them in a vacuum chamber. The two films were then allowed to react at room temperature to form transparent and highly smooth films with a high optical transmittance (T) of 92%.Interestingly, the researchers found that the order in which the layers were deposited affected the formed crystalline phases. They noticed that the deposition of CsI layer over CuI resulted in the formation of a blue light-emitting thin film of Cs3Cu2I5, which is the equilibrium phase under this thickness ratio condition.In contrast, depositing CuI over CsI resulted in a yellow light-emitting thin film of CsCu2I3. The formation of these different phases was attributed to an interdiffusion of the Cs and Cu atoms between the two layers. Based on these observations, the researchers found that the formation of each phase could be controlled by simply adjusting the thickness of each film to reach a specific ratio of CsI to CuI.The researchers thus argued that the interdiffusion process leads to the formation of distinct local structures containing point defects that decay through nonradiative channels upon photoexcitation, resulting in highly efficient emissions.\"We propose that this formation originates from the rapid diffusion of Cu+ and I\u2212 ions into CsI crystals along with the formation of I\u2212 at the Cs+ site and interstitial Cu+ in the CsI lattice,\" explains Prof. Hosono. The photoluminescent properties of Cs3Cu2I5 originate from the unique local structure around the luminescent center, the asymmetric [Cu2I5]3\u2212polyhedron iodocuprate anion, consisting of the edge-shared CuI3 triangle and the CuI4 tetrahedron dimer that is isolated by Cs+ ions.Using this approach, the researchers were able to fabricate patterned thin films by selectively depositing a CsI layer through a shadow mask. This allowed them to control the deposition of CsI and pattern only the desired area of the substrate.By carefully adjusting for the thickness of the CuI and CsI layers, they were able to successfully fabricate a film with a central blue light-emitting Cs3Cu2I5 region bordered by a yellow light-emitting CsCu2I3 region. In addition, they demonstrated that the same thin films can be obtained by using solution-processed CuI and patterned CsI thin films for anticipation of future applications.\"Our study explains the mechanism underlying the formation of the rare local structures in Cs3Cu2I5 and its association with photoluminescence in these materials. These results can ultimately pave the way for the development of high-quality thin film devices with ideal optical properties for advanced stacking applications,\" concludes Prof. Hosono.

  "text": "The never-ending demand for carbon-rich fuels to drive the economy keeps adding more and more carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. While efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions, that alone cannot counter the adverse effects of the gas already present in the atmosphere.          So, scientists have come up with innovative ways to use existing atmospheric CO2 by transforming it into useful chemicals such as formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol. A popular method for carrying out such conversions is to use visible light for driving the photoreduction of CO2 via photocatalysts.In a recent breakthrough published in Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, a team of researchers led by Prof. Kazuhiko Maeda of Tokyo Institute of Technology developed a tin-based metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) that can enable selective photoreduction of CO2. They reported a novel tin (Sn)-based MOF called KGF-10, with the formula [SnII2(H3ttc)2.MeOH]n (H3ttc: trithiocyanuric acid and MeOH: methanol).It successfully reduced CO2 into HCOOH in the presence of visible light. \"Most high-performance CO2 reduction photocatalysts driven by visible light rely on rare, precious metals as principal components. Furthermore, integrating the functions of light absorption and catalysis into a single molecular unit made up of abundant metals has remained a long-standing challenge. Hence, Sn was the ideal candidate as it can overcome both challenges,\" explains Prof. Maeda.MOFs, which bring the best of both metals and organic materials, are being explored as the more sustainable alternative to conventional rare-earth metal-based photocatalysts. Sn, known for its ability to act as both a catalyst and absorber during a photocatalytic reaction, could be a promising candidate for MOF-based photocatalysts. While MOFs composed of zirconium, iron, and lead have been widely explored, not much is known about Sn-based MOFs.For synthesizing the Sn-based MOF KGF-10, the researchers used H3ttc, MeOH, and tin chloride as the starting materials and chose 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole as the electron donor and the hydrogen source. The prepared KGF-10 was then subjected to several analysis techniques. They revealed that the material showed moderate CO2 adsorption ability, had a bandgap of 2.5 eV, and absorbed visible light wavelengths.Once aware of the physical and chemical properties of the new material, scientists used it for catalyzing the reduction of CO2 in the presence of visible light. They found that KGF-10 successfully reduced CO2 into formate (HCOO-) with 99% selectivity without needing any additional photosensitizer or catalyst. It also exhibited a record-high apparent quantum yield\u2014 the ratio of the number of electrons involved in the reaction to the total number of incident photons\u2014of 9.8% at 400 nm. Furthermore, structural analysis carried out during the reactions revealed that KGF-10 underwent structural changes while facilitating photocatalytic reduction.This study presented for the first time a tin-based high-performance, precious-metal free, and single-component photocatalyst for visible-light-driven reduction of CO2 to formate. The excellent properties of KGF-10 demonstrated by the team could open new avenues for its application as a photocatalyst in reactions such as solar energy-driven CO2 reduction.\"The results of our study are a testimony to the fact that MOFs can be a platform for creating outstanding photocatalytic functions, usually unattainable with molecular metal complexes, using non-toxic, inexpensive, and Earth-abundant metals,\" concludes Prof. Maeda.

  "text": "Chemistry researchers at Flinders University have 'struck gold' by discovering a new way to make 'green' polymers from low-cost building blocks with just a small amount of electricity.          The reaction is fast and occurs at room temperature. No hazardous chemical initiators are required\u2014just electricity, with many potential uses including in gold mining and recycling e-waste, an interdisciplinary team reveal in an article just published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.While hundreds of millions of tons of plastic is produced every year, with up to half used for single purposes, the Flinders University research group is working on more sustainable options. The power used in production is a contributor to pollution and global warming.\"The use of electricity to produce new materials is an emerging field of research that opens many doors to new chemicals and polymers that can be produced in a more sustainable way,\" says co-author Dr. Thomas Nicholls, an expert in using electrochemistry to make valuable molecules.The process begins by adding an electron to the basic building block or monomer. After 'electrocuting' the monomer, it reacts with another building block in a chain reaction which leads to the formation of a polymer.First-author and Ph.D. candidate Jasmine Pople says, \"Our method to electrochemically produce polymers provides new materials that are highly functional and environmentally friendly.\"\"The use of electricity to make valuable molecules is expanding rapidly due to its versatility. Additionally, it may generate less waste than traditional chemical syntheses and it can be powered with renewable energy.\"The key polymer made by the team has sulfur-sulfur bonds in its backbone. These sulfur groups can do useful things like bind precious metals such as gold. The team demonstrated that the key polymer could remove 97% of gold from solutions of relevance to mining and e-waste recycling.The sulfur-sulfur bonds can also be broken and reformed. This interesting property enabled the team to discover conditions to convert the polymer back to its original building block. This is an important advance in recycling.Typically, when common plastics are recycled, they are simply heated and reshaped into a new product. This process can cause degradation and down-cycling (conversion to a less valuable material), leading to eventual disposal in landfill.In contrast, the polymers made in the latest research from Flinders University scientists can be chemically converted back into its constituent building blocks in high yield\u2014meaning that building block can be used again to make new polymers.The team also carried out quantum mechanical calculations to understand the details of how the reaction works. The findings were surprising and fortuitous.\"The polymerization has a clever self-correcting mechanism: whenever the wrong reaction occurs, it reverses until the correct reaction proceeds, ensuring a uniform polymer,\" says Research Associate in computational and physical chemistry Dr. Le Nhan PhamFuture applications of this class of materials include environmental remediation, gold mining, and use of the polymer as an anti-microbial agent.

A GAN is trained until the discriminator cannot distinguish the generated data from the real data.In this paper, researchers explored the quantum advantage in small molecule drug discovery by substituting each part of MolGAN, an implicit GAN for small molecular graphs, with a variational quantum circuit (VQC), step by step, including as the noise generator, generator with the patch method, and quantum discriminator, comparing its performance with the classical counterpart.The study not only demonstrated that the trained quantum GANs can generate training-set-like molecules by using the VQC as the noise generator, but that the quantum generator outperforms the classical GAN in the drug properties of generated compounds and the goal-directed benchmark.In addition, the study showed that the quantum discriminator of GAN with only tens of learnable parameters can generate valid molecules and outperforms the classical counterpart with tens of thousands parameters in terms of generated molecule properties and KL-divergence score.\"Quantum computing is recognized as the next technology breakthrough which will make a great impact, and the pharmaceutical industry is believed to be among the first wave of industries benefiting from the advancement,\" said Jimmy Yen-Chu Lin, Ph.D., GM of Insilico Medicine Taiwan and corresponding author of the paper. \"This paper demonstrates Insilico's first footprint in quantum computing with AI in molecular generation, underscoring our vision in the field.\"Building on these findings, Insilico scientists plan to integrate the hybrid quantum GAN model into Chemistry42, the Company's proprietary small molecule generation engine, to further accelerate and improve its AI-driven drug discovery and development process.Insilico was one of the first to use GANs in de novo molecular design, and published the first paper in this field in 2016. The Company has delivered 11 preclinical candidates by GAN-based generative AI models and its lead program has been validated in Phase I clinical trials.\"I am proud of the positive results our quantum computing team has achieved through their efforts and innovation,\" said Alex Zhavoronkov, Ph.D., founder and CEO of Insilico Medicine. \"I believe this is the first small step in our journey.

  "text": "To be able to exploit the advantages of elements and their molecular compounds in a targeted manner, chemists have to develop a fundamental understanding of their properties. In the case of the element bismuth, a team from the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung has now taken an important step.          Chemists at the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung strive for the rational design of chemical processes that lead to more efficient and sustainable chemistry for academia as well as industry. A fundamental understanding of the properties of elements such as bismuth and their molecular compounds is necessary in order to be able to take advantage of their potential for catalysis.A team led by Josep Cornell\u00e0 and Frank Neese, group leader and director at the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung, has now found that there are still some \"white spots\" in the chemical landscape that need to be tapped. The researchers have now published their work on an intriguing property of new bismuth complexes in the journal Science.Why bismuth? Research group leader Josep Cornell\u00e0's team has been interested in this particular metal for quite a while. \"Bismuth can offer some advantages\u2014compared to other metals. For example, it is more readily available and less toxic than other elements. In addition, special properties of bismuth that other 'classical' catalysis candidates do not have could play a role in future reaction designs,\" Cornell\u00e0 explains.What is it that makes the M\u00fclheim Bismuth molecule so special? Atoms consist of the atomic nucleus as well as an atomic shell formed by electrons. When molecules are synthesized from atoms or fragments, usually pairs of electrons from different atoms come together to for chemical bonds. However, chemists are often interested in situation that deviate from this situation, which is the case when the molecules have unpaired electrons. Such systems tend to be highly reactive and will readily interact with other molecules.\"Normally, molecules with unpaired electrons are always magnetic,\" explains Frank Neese. But now the researchers of the Kohlenforschung have developed a molecule containing bismuth that has unpaired electrons and yet, strangely enough, shows no magnetism at all. The solution to this riddle has to do with, among other things, the special position of bismuth in the periodic table of the elements.Bismuth is the heaviest of the stable elements\u2014all subsequent elements are radioactive. Due to the particularly heavy atomic nucleus, the electrons show a special behavior, which can only be understood with the help of Einstein's theory of relativity. These properties lead to the initially perplexing experimental finding.\"Our molecule is not really 'non-magnetic',\" the researchers explain, \"but there is no magnetic field on Earth strong enough to detect magnetism in our system.\" The fact that the researchers were able to calculate the fascinating properties of this molecule from first principles of physics is due to the quantum chemistry program package ORCA, developed in M\u00fclheim and widely used throughout all chemical disciplines by tens of thousands of chemists worldwide.With their work, the scientists from M\u00fclheim have added an important point to the \"chemical profile\" of bismuth. This may be of importance in the future when designing new types of catalysts.

  "text": "Pharmaceutical drugs can save lives, but taking these medications as prescribed\u2014especially among those with chronic conditions\u2014can be challenging, for a variety of different reasons. Improving medication adherence could reduce unfavorable health outcomes, hospitalizations, and preventable deaths, while simultaneously reducing health care costs by up to $300B annually in the United States alone.          One potential way to increase adherence is to reduce how often a person needs to take their medication. This can be achieved through a controlled-release system, where a single injection contains a drug that is continually released in the body over an extended period of time. Unfortunately, many controlled-release systems deliver a substantial portion of their cargo right after injection, which can result in inconsistent drug dosing\u2014more drug is released initially (potentially resulting in toxicity) and less drug is released over time (potentially at too small a dose to be effective). A system that could release discrete doses at specific time points could revolutionize the way drugs are delivered, from multi-dose vaccinations to daily medications.Responding to this challenge, researchers from Rice University have developed PULSED (for Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs). Their method, recently reported in Advanced Materials, creates drug-filled microparticles that can be engineered to degrade and release their therapeutic cargo days or weeks after injection. By combining multiple microparticles with different degradation times into a single injection, the researchers could develop a drug formulation that delivers many doses over time.\"As a field, we are continually aiming to develop effective and efficient drug delivery systems that maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize side effects, which can ultimately improve medication adherence,\" said Luisa Russell, Ph.D., a program director in the Division of Discovery Science & Technology at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB). \"With several doses combined into a single treatment, the controlled-release system described here could transform the therapeutic landscape, potentially negating the need for frequent drug administration, both at home and at the clinic.\"The PULSED microparticles are composed of PLGA, or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), a commonly used polymer in a number of FDA-approved devices. PLGA is made up of repeating units of lactic acid and glycolic acid, two molecules that occur naturally in our bodies. By extending the overall length of the polymer, modifying the ratio of lactic acid to glycolic acid, and \"capping\" the end of the polymer with different molecules, researchers can dictate how long it takes PLGA to disintegrate (and thereby release its therapeutic payload).      \"In our case, we can combine populations of microparticles with different PLGA compositions that each release their entire contents at one distinct time point,\" explained senior study author Kevin McHugh, Ph.D., an assistant professor at Rice University. \"This allows us to achieve multiple release events at specific, predetermined times.\"Here's how the drug-loaded microparticles are made: Heated, semiliquid PLGA is pressed into a mold and then cooled, solidifying in the shape of hollow cylinders with an opening at the top. The core of each microparticle is filled with therapeutic cargo, and then the top of the microparticles are heated, causing the PLGA to melt and flow over the opening to seal the drug inside. The initial particles that the researchers developed were 400 micrometers in diameter (for reference, the thickness of a dime is about 1350 micrometers).As a first step, the researchers filled four different PLGA microparticle shells with dextran (a type of sugar) that was tagged with a fluorescent molecule, allowing them to easily visualize and measure cargo release. They incubated the microparticles in a body-temperature buffer to mimic real-life conditions and found that the microparticles released their contents at staggered intervals, ranging from roughly eight to 31 days, depending on the PLGA formulation. Importantly, the researchers found that each microparticle formulation released its cargo rapidly, emptying 75% of the dextran over a period of approximately one to three days. They had similar results when they repeated the experiments in mice.\"While we extended the microparticle degradation time to roughly five weeks in this study, we have only begun to tinker with PLGA compositions to further extend their degradation times and subsequent drug release,\" said McHugh. \"Based on our previous work with other systems, we are confident that by changing PLGA length and component ratios, we could extend release to six months and likely much longer.\"After the researchers optimized their microparticle fabrication process, they needed to ensure that a pharmaceutical drug was still viable once encased inside. Many drugs\u2014especially biologic agents, which are developed using living components\u2014are sensitive to heat, which the researchers use to seal their microparticles.What's more, the researchers wanted to be certain that long-term storage inside the human body\u2014conditions that heat and acidify the microparticles\u2014wouldn't adversely affect the drug. They encapsulated bevacizumab (an FDA-approved antibody that is used to treat several types of cancer) into their microparticles along with different kinds of excipients (inactive drug stabilizers) and evaluated the drug's activity. With the right combination of excipients, the microparticles released bioactive and viable bevacizumab, even after weeks under simulated body conditions.Finally, the researchers wanted to push the envelope and further miniaturize their microparticles. While the original particles could easily flow through an 18-gauge needle, which is routinely used for things like blood collection, smaller needles are preferred for pediatric vaccinations and insulin administration, which typically range from 22 to 31 gauge. Using a smaller mold and the same fabrication method, the researchers were able to shrink the microparticles down to a diameter of 100 micrometers. The loading capacity of these tiny microparticles is 50-fold lower than the original microparticles, but they could potentially be used with even the smallest of commonly used needles, said McHugh. Future work will include evaluating the disintegration time and cargo release of these miniaturized particles.\"Routes of drug administration are often underappreciated in the field of pharmaceutical medicine,\" McHugh said. \"Our study, while still early in development, could reshape how routine vaccinations and recurring medications are delivered, ultimately improving medication adherence and human health.\" More information:Tyler P.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the process that was developed six years ago?",
  "answer_squad": " OXZEO",
  "text": "Researchers have reported a strategy to disentangle the activity-selectivity tradeoff for direct conversion of syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, into desirable ethylene, propylene, and butylene. These hydrocarbons are known as light olefins and are the most-used building blocks for plastics.          \"Activity and selectivity are two primary indexes of a successful catalyst for chemical reactions. A higher activity means higher efficiency in converting feedstock to products, thereby reducing energy consumption,\" said Jiao Feng, an associate professor at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Dalian, China. \"Selectivity reflects the percentage of the desired products; for example, ethylene, propylene and butylene in this case, which determines the economy of the technology.\"For almost a century, a process called the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) was used for direct syngas conversion with iron or cobalt-based catalysts for synthesis of chemicals. However, selectivity for light olefins remained a challenge. An alternative process, named OXZEO and developed six years ago by the same research team using metal oxide-zeolite catalyst, improved light-olefin selectivity far beyond the theoretical limit of FTS. Despite the significant progress over the years, the activity is still limited by the activity-selectivity tradeoff.For example, when FTS is used to convert syngas to light olefins, the yield amounts to around 26%. Using traditional silicon containing zeotypes within the OXZEO catalyst concept, the light-olefins yield has so far maxed out at 27%. These limits originate from activity-selectivity tradeoff, a long-standing challenge in catalysis. This can be traced to the catalytic sites for both the target and side reactions, which are usually entangled on technical catalysts.Now, in a paper published in the journal Science on May, 18, 2023, a team led by Dr. Jiao, Prof. Pan and Prof. Bao has shown that incorporating germanium-substituted aluminophosphates within the OXZEO catalyst concept can disentangle the desired target reaction from the undesired secondary reactions. It enhances the conversion of the intermediates to produce olefins by creating more active sites and in turn generation of intermediates but without degrading the selectivity of light olefins. With this new strategy, researchers simultaneously achieved high CO conversion and light-olefins selectivity and the yield reached an unprecedented 48% under optimized conditions.To validate the mechanism, researchers also studied silicon-substitute and magnesium-substitute aluminophosphates and tested them in similar scenarios. The active sites of these two zeotypes cannot efficiently shield the side reaction of hydrogenation and oligomerization, thereby the activity-selectivity tradeoff cannot be overcome, despite optimizing the acid site density or reaction conditions.\"Separating the active sites of the two key steps of syngas conversion via OXZEO catalysts, and increasing the active site density and modulating its properties for kinetics of intermediate transport and reactions within the zeotype confined pores provides one effective solution for syngas conversion to light olefins,\" said Pan Xiulian, professor at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Dalian, China. \"We expect that this can be applicable to analogous bifunctional catalysis in other reactions and will be of interest for further development of zeolite catalysis.\"\"If it can be incorporated with green hydrogen energy technology in the future, it will make significant contribution to the goal of carbon neutrality,\" said Bao Xinhe, professor at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Dalian and the President of the University of Science and Technology of China.

  "answer_squad": " chlorine",
  "text": "A team of chemists from Tsinghua University and Guangxi Normal University, both in China, has found an organic catalyst that can be used to make chlorine more energy efficiently. In their paper published in the journal Nature, the group describes how they searched for and found an organocatalyst with an amide functional group that could be used to enable a chlorine evolution reaction.          Thomas Turek, with Clausthal University of Technology, has published a News and Views piece in the same journal issue outlining the work done by the team in China.Chlorine (a yellowish-green gas at room temperature) is widely used to disinfect water, such as in swimming pools. But it is also used in a wide variety of other applications such as making plastics and bleaching paper. Unfortunately, the process for producing chlorine uses a lot of energy and also emits a lot of carbon dioxide\u2014it involves electrolysis of sodium chloride solutions that generate both chlorine and sodium hydroxide\u2014both of which are used in manufacturing applications.For that reason, scientists have been looking for more efficient and cleaner ways to make the material. One such approach has involved the use of organic (instead of metal) catalysts because they tend to be less expensive, less toxic and they are generally easier to obtain.After searching for possibilities, the team found an organic molecule in the amide group RCON-H that enabled the creation of chlorine by helping chloride ions in salt water combine in ways that led to the production of chlorine on a positive electrode. They also found that adding CO2 gave rise to the intermediate, carbamic acid, which enhanced efficiency of the catalyst exponentially; this was because it binds to the amide nitrogen and in so doing created a radical species.They also found that after the reaction, it was relatively easy to separate the CO2 from the chlorine because of the differences in physical properties. Testing showed that the process was able to achieve a density of 10 kA m\u207b\u00b2 and had a selectivity of 99.6% with an overpotential of just 89 mV.The team concludes by noting that future processes using the new catalyst would use far less energy than the conventional approach and they would be much cleaner\u2014many would not release any harmful by-products at all. They also suggest that their new approach could pave the way in general for a cleaner approach to producing chlorine.

  "text": "At least 2 billion people worldwide routinely drink water contaminated with disease-causing microbes.          Now Stanford University scientists have invented a low-cost, recyclable powder that kills thousands of waterborne bacteria per second when exposed to ordinary sunlight. The discovery of this ultrafast disinfectant could be a significant advance for nearly 30% of the world's population with no access to safe drinking water, according to the Stanford team. Their results are published in Nature Wateron May 18.\"Waterborne diseases are responsible for 2 million deaths annually, the majority in children under the age of 5,\" said study co-lead author Tong Wu, a former postdoctoral scholar of materials science and engineering (MSE) in the Stanford School of Engineering. \"We believe that our novel technology will facilitate revolutionary changes in water disinfection and inspire more innovations in this exciting interdisciplinary field.\"Conventional water-treatment technologies include chemicals, which can produce toxic byproducts, and ultraviolet light, which takes a relatively long time to disinfect and requires a source of electricity.The new disinfectant developed at Stanford is a harmless metallic powder that works by absorbing both UV and high-energy visible light from the sun. The powder consists of nano-sized flakes of aluminum oxide, molybdenum sulfide, copper, and iron oxide.\"We only used a tiny amount of these materials,\" said senior author Yi Cui, the Fortinet Founders Professor of MSE and of Energy Science & Engineering in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. \"The materials are low cost and fairly abundant. The key innovation is that, when immersed in water, they all function together.\"Fast, nontoxic, and recyclableAfter absorbing photons from the sun, the molybdenum sulfide/copper catalyst performs like a semiconductor/metal junction, enabling the photons to dislodge electrons. The freed electrons then react with the surrounding water, generating hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals\u2014one of the most biologically destructive forms of oxygen. The newly formed chemicals quickly kill the bacteria by seriously damaging their cell membranes.      For the study, the Stanford team used a 200 milliliter [6.8 ounce] beaker of room-temperature water contaminated with about 1 million E. coli bacteria per mL [.03 oz.].\"We stirred the powder into the contaminated water,\" said co-lead author Bofei Liu, a former MSE postdoc. \"Then we carried out the disinfection test on the Stanford campus in real sunlight, and within 60 seconds, no live bacteria were detected.\"The powdery nanoflakes can move around quickly, make physical contact with a lot of bacteria and kill them fast, he added.The chemical byproducts generated by sunlight also dissipate quickly.\"The lifetime of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxy radicals is very short,\" Cui said. \"If they don't immediately find bacteria to oxidize, the chemicals break down into water and oxygen and are discarded within seconds. So you can drink the water right away.\"The nontoxic powder is also recyclable. Iron oxide enables the nanoflakes to be removed from water with an ordinary magnet. In the study, the researchers used magnetism to collect the same powder 30 times to treat 30 different samples of contaminated water.\"For hikers and backpackers, I could envision carrying a tiny amount of powder and a small magnet,\" Cui said. \"During the day you put the powder in water, shake it up a little bit under sunlight and within a minute you have drinkable water. You use the magnet to take out the particles for later use.\"The powder might also be useful in wastewater treatment plants that currently use UV lamps to disinfect treated water, he added.\"During the day the plant can use visible sunlight, which would work much faster than UV and would probably save energy,\" Cui said. \"The nanoflakes are fairly easy to make and can be rapidly scaled up by the ton.\"The study focused on E. coli, which can cause severe gastrointestinal illness and can even be life-threatening. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has set the maximum contaminant-level goal for E. coli in drinking water at zero. The Stanford team plans to test the new powder on other waterborne pathogens, including viruses, protozoa, and parasites that also cause serious diseases and death.

  "text": "The University of Alicante Applied Biochemistry research group\u2060\u2014in collaboration with researchers from the Alicante University Hospital Dr. Balmis (HGUDB) and the Alicante Health and Biomedical Research Institute (ISABIAL)\u2060\u2014has identified the anti-cancer capacity of a pigment present in the Santa Pola salt flats. This pigment is produced by certain microorganisms, the \"halophilic archaea,\" in order to protect themselves from the sun, and its anti-tumor capacity has been tested in several types of breast cancer.          Professor in Biology and director of the group Rosa Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez explains that this important finding, which has been published in the journal Scientific Reports, began with the development of Micaela Giani's Ph.D. thesis. There, she demonstrated\u2014through in vitro tests\u2014the antioxidant activity of the pigment and its effect on enzymes (biocatalysts) that are involved in pathologies such as diabetes or metabolic syndrome such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome.After these results were made public, it was then that they wondered what would happen if they added the pigment to the cancer cells, based on the hypothesis that, being a pigment with an antioxidant activity almost 300 times higher than that of other antioxidants, it could limit the ability of these cells to grow and reproduce, as explained by the researcher.In this second phase, the research group has worked in collaboration with Dr. Gloria Peir\u00f3, pathologist at the HGUDB and lecturer in the UA Department of Biotechnology, and Yoel Genaro Montoyo-Pujol, Ph.D. in Experimental and Biosanitary Sciences and researcher also at the UA, both belonging to the breast cancer and immunology research group at ISABIAL.                Credit: Asociacion RUVID             Thanks to this collaboration, the effect of this pigment could be tested in vitro in cell lines representing different intrinsic phenotypes of breast cancer and a line of healthy breast tissue. According to Mart\u00ednez, they have reached the conclusion that, in certain doses, the pigment does not cause any harmful effect on healthy cells, but it does limit the growth capacity of neoplastic cells. She also stressed that this finding opens a door to biomedicine, to the design of new strategies to fight cancer based on the use of natural compounds, which are not harmful to the body.Halophilic archaea are extremophilic microorganisms that require a hypersaline environment to thrive, so they are mainly found in coastal salt marshes, inland salt marshes or hypersaline lakes. These microorganisms synthesize rare C50 carotenoid pigments called bacteriorruberin (BR) and its derivatives monoanhydrobacterioruberin (MABR) and bisanhydrobacterioruberin (BABR).Based on this discovery, as the researcher pointed out, there are several phases to be developed, starting with extending the study with different cell lines of other types of tumors, to continue with tests on tissue samples from biopsies or surgical specimens, in order to design possible treatment protocols using this pigment, and then move on to animal studies before reaching clinical use in patients.

  "text": "Food allergies pose a significant health risk, resulting in numerous hospitalizations every year, as even trace amounts of allergens can trigger severe reactions. Cross-contamination of food products can happen easily in the production process, so it's important to have reliable methods of testing for allergens.          A new study conducted at the University of Illinois explores the application of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to detect three types of allergens in quinoa flour. The researchers say the method is fast, easy, non-invasive, inexpensive, and highly accurate.\"Detecting adulterated allergenic components in food could benefit millions of people around the world who suffer from food allergies,\" said Qianyi (Lisa) Wu, an undergraduate student in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U of l, and lead author on the paper. The project was supported by a grant from the Office of Undergraduate Research at U of I.\"We use an NIR device to measure spectral information through the reflectance of light in the samples. We tested models with different wavelengths to determine the best NIR system for allergen detection,\" she added.The researchers used NIR spectroscopy to identify three common allergens\u2014peanut, sesame, and wheat\u2014in quinoa flour, a gluten-free grain that is often used as a wheat substitute. Adulterated or contaminated quinoa could be dangerous for people with allergies, so it is crucial to find any presence of allergens.Traditional laboratory methods for allergen detection typically involve complex DNA analyses that require costly equipment and specialized personnel. These methods are time-consuming, involve the use of chemicals, and often result in destruction of the sample, so industry scientists are seeking better approaches to detect allergens.\"NIR spectroscopy offers numerous advantages. It is non-destructive, non-invasive, and doesn't use chemicals. It provides results in real time, and with a short training period, anyone can perform the analysis,\" said Mohammed Kamruzzaman, assistant professor in ABE and Wu's faculty advisor. Kamruzzaman is corresponding author on the paper.      NIR spectroscopy uses near-infrared light to measure the absorbance of different wavelengths, Kamruzzaman explained.\"Each material has a unique 'fingerprint' of light absorbance. When allergens are present in the quinoa flour, the NIR instrument can detect them. Then we use machine learning to analyze the gathered information, allowing us to identify the allergens and quantify their concentration,\" he said.NIR spectroscopy is an indirect method of analysis, so it is not 100% accurate but comes very close. Even if it doesn't capture the exact amount of contaminants present in the food, it will identify whether the allergen is there or not, and that is what the consumer needs to know, Kamruzzaman stated.Other techniques usually focus on detecting a single allergen, but this method can detect multiple allergens simultaneously. It can easily be modified to detect additional allergens and to test other products than quinoa.The researchers said it will not be difficult to develop low-cost miniature sensors based on their methodology. These sensors can be used in various settings, including industry facilities, restaurants, and even homes. Eventually it may even be possible to have a mobile phone app that can detect food allergens on the spot.Wu said the opportunity to conduct research as an undergraduate student has been instrumental in deciding her future plans.\"During my sophomore year, I attended an American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) meeting and Dr. Kamruzzaman gave a speech introducing his research topic. I thought it sounded really interesting, so I contacted him, and that's how I got involved,\" Wu stated. \"I was thinking about going to graduate school, but I wasn't entirely certain. After being engaged in research for several years, I have discovered my passion for it.\"Wu received a U of I Graduate College Illinois Distinguished Fellowship, and upon graduating with her bachelor's degree in May 2023, she will continue directly into a doctoral program in ABE with Kamruzzaman.\"Lisa has done outstanding work with a small grant from the Office of Undergraduate Research. It is truly inspiring for undergraduate students to realize they can do meaningful research and publish their findings. This can serve as motivation for other students to engage with faculty and actively pursue research opportunities. I'm always open to students reaching out to me for potential involvement in research projects,\" Kamruzzaman added.The paper, \"Reagent-free detection of multiple allergens in gluten-free flour using NIR spectroscopy and multivariate analysis,\" is published in the Journal of Food Composition and Analysis.

  "text": "A new study conducted by a team of scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (MPIC) reveals that the adverse health effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are attributable to the conversion of peroxides into more reactive species such as the hydroxyl radical (OH) rather than the direct chemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as previously thought.          In the scientific literature, the total production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2 is commonly used as proxy for the toxicity of air pollutants and their ability to induce oxidative stress and inflammation. The research team led by Thomas Berkemeier from the MPIC in Mainz found that ROS concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the human respiratory tract may be primarily determined by the release of endogenous H2O2 and the inhalation of ambient gas-phase H2O2, while the chemical production of H2O2 through inhaled PM2.5 is less important.\"Based on our simulations, we think that the overall concentrations of these reactive species in the lungs are large anyway, and not directly dependent on levels of air pollution,\" says Dr. Thomas Berkemeier, head of the Chemical Kinetics & Reaction Mechanisms group at the MPIC. They used a computer model to understand the relevant physical, chemical, and biological processes, and quantify the health effects of different types of air pollutants.\"Our new model simulates the chemical reactions that happen in the respiratory tract. For the first time, we included production, diffusion, and removal of hydrogen peroxide from cells and the blood stream into our computer model. This was quite challenging, because it is not so easy to put these processes in biological tissues into equations,\" explains Thomas Berkemeier.New research directions\"The findings of this study suggest that the current paradigms for assessing the differential toxicity of individual PM2.5 components need to be critically reassessed,\" says Prof. Dr. Ulrich P\u00f6schl, Head of the Multiphase Chemistry Department at the MPIC. The study proposed that the chemical production of superoxide and H2O2 in a cell-free assay may not be a suitable metric for assessing the differential toxicity of individual PM2.5 components, and some acellular oxidative potential assays may not capture the actual deleterious effects of PM2.5.Fine particulates might act through Fenton chemistryHowever, the production of hydroxyl radicals (OH) was strongly correlated with Fenton chemistry of PM2.5 in the model calculations. \"The model simulations suggest that PM2.5 mostly acts by conversion of peroxides into highly reactive OH radicals. Thus, PM2.5 is not so much the fuel, but rather the catalyst of the chemical reactions that cause damage to cells and tissues,\" says Berkemeier explaining the role of inhaled particles in the model.Additionally, PM2.5 may stimulate the production of superoxide from endogenous sources, which further contributes to the adverse health effects of air pollution.The study underscores the importance of continued research to better understand the chemical mechanisms underlying the health effects of air pollution and to develop effective strategies to mitigate these effects. The authors believe that this study will contribute significantly to this important research effort. Their findings are published in Environmental Science: Atmospheres.Air pollution is a major health risk that affects millions of people worldwide, but the underlying chemical mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) typically contains chemical components that can trigger oxidation reactions. When inhaled and deposited in the human respiratory tract, they can induce and sustain radical reaction cycles that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) that covers the airways and alveoli in human lungs.Numerous studies have shown that excess concentrations of ROS like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) can cause oxidative stress injuring cells and tissues in the respiratory tract.

  "answer_squad": " CBD",
  "text": "Soon, you'll be able to get a box of freshly picked, sweet strawberries from the grocery store or local farm stand. But it's disappointing when you get them home and find that the ones at the bottom have started to rot. To increase the berries' shelf life, researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces have incorporated cannabidiol\u2014a non-hallucinogenic compound from cannabis known as CBD\u2014and sodium alginate into an edible antimicrobial coating.          CBD is popular because of its potential therapeutic effects. But this cannabinoid has also been shown to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. In previous studies, CBD limited the growth of some bacteria and pathogenic fungi, such as the ones that cause fresh fruits and vegetables to rot.However, the oily compound needs to be evenly distributed in water before it can be widely incorporated into foods or used for food preservation. One possible way to do this is to encapsulate the CBD molecules in edible polymers. So, Pongpat Sukhavattanakul, Sarute Ummartyotin and colleagues wanted to see if a food coating made using CBD-filled nanoparticles could promote antimicrobial activity and extend the freshness of strawberries.The researchers encapsulated CBD in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), a biodegradable polymer used in drug delivery, producing 400-nm-wide particles. They mixed the most stable nanoparticles, containing 20% by weight CBD, with sodium alginate in water. Strawberries were then submerged into solutions containing different amounts of nanoparticles before a second dip into a mixture of ascorbic acid and calcium chloride to turn the colorless coating into a gel.Untreated and treated strawberries were then placed in open plastic containers at refrigerator temperatures. After 15 days, CBD-treated samples ripened and decayed much more slowly than untreated ones, possibly because of reduced microbial growth. The coating with the most CBD-loaded nanoparticles preserved the berries' dark red appearance, enhanced their antioxidant activity the most and exhibited the largest antimicrobial protection over the storage period, suggesting that this version would lead to the longest shelf life.The researchers say that their results demonstrate how encapsulated CBD could be used to create a colorless antimicrobial coating for active food packaging.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the natural substance found in the cannabis plant?",
  "answer_squad": " cis-THC",
  "text": "A group of researchers at Leipzig University has developed a new method for synthesizing cis-tetrahydrocannabinol (cis-THC)\u2014a natural substance found in the cannabis plant that produces the characteristic psychoactive effect and has many potential applications, including in the pharmaceutical industry.          \"Our strategy makes it possible to produce cis-tetrahydrocannabinoids and test them for their biological activity,\" explains researcher Caroline Dorsch, who, together with Professor Christoph Schneider from the Institute of Organic Chemistry, has published her findings in the journal Angewandte Chemie.She points out that until now there has been no way of synthesizing this structural class in a consistent way. With their simple, inexpensive and nature-based synthesis, the Leipzig researchers have for the first time made the substance class of cis-tetrahydrocannabinoids accessible for a broad range of applications. The researcher notes that because previous methods required many steps and large amounts of chemicals and solvents, their approach is clearly superior. The substance can be synthesized with high overall yields and excellent optical purities using the new method.Tetrahydrocannabinol is one of the phytocannabinoids produced in the cannabis plant. These compounds accumulate mainly in the inflorescences of the female plants. It has been known since the 1960s that this also produces the characteristic psychotropic effect in the body.Research into this natural substance led to the elucidation of the underlying mechanism of its action\u2014the endocannabinoid system. This is the term used to describe the signaling pathway in the body that is affected by tetrahydrocannabinol and causes the characteristic effects of smoking marijuana, for example.\"Manipulating this pathway is of pharmaceutical relevance. Cannabinoids can have a variety of effects in the body, for example functioning as painkillers, antipsychotics or anti-epileptics. However, only a few cannabinoids are currently available on the pharmaceutical market. The prescription of natural cannabis products is occasionally viewed as an exception,\" says Dorsch.The possession, cultivation and distribution of narcotic cannabis products is prohibited in Germany under the Narcotics Act (BtMG). Samples containing trans-configured cannabinoids are classified as narcotic. Recent studies have shown that cis-THC accumulates mainly in parts of the cannabis plant where the related trans-compounds are absent. This has so far led to the classification of such samples as textile or non-narcotic hemp. However, cis-THC does have a mild psychotropic effect.THC is a chiral compound. Chirality describes a spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule which cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. The image and mirror image of such compounds are called enantiomers and often have different effects in the human body. While nature can easily control the targeted synthesis of these compounds, this is a major challenge under laboratory conditions\u2014which this work successfully overcomes.The newly developed process also requires very small amounts of catalyst, which is highly attractive from an environmental perspective in terms of saving energy and resources and minimizing by-products.cis-THC has received less research attention than the more potent trans-THC. Nevertheless, other natural substances not derived from cannabis also share a basic structure with cis-THC. These are valuable compounds with promising pharmacological profiles that have yet to be fully explored.The new strategy now presented has laid an important foundation for the more detailed investigation of this family of substances. In addition to cis-THC, a number of other natural and non-natural representatives of this structural class have been produced using this method.

The research was the brainchild of Brendan Chapman, a Senior Lecturer in Forensic Science at Murdoch who has spent more than a decade working with law enforcement at crime scenes and in the laboratory.The pair have coined the bacterial DNA makeup of the sex organs, the \"sexome.\"Identifying the perpetrator of a sexual assault is complex and often requires the analysis of human DNA to catch the offender.But traces of DNA are not always found, such as when semen is not present, making the task all the more difficult for investigators.\"Current techniques for investigating sexual assault work well, however if there aren't enough male cells then there may not be enough to link it to a person using conventional DNA analysis,\" Dixon said.\"This research shows that we can detect that a heterosexual couple has had intercourse based on the bacteria we find after sex.\"Some 'male bacteria' stays on the female and some 'female bacteria' stays on the male.\"The end goal is that we'll be able to take a swab, analyze the bacteria, and link it back to an individual, or at the very least eliminate suspects.\"Dixon explained that even if the bacteria wasn't completely unique to an individual, it would likely be distinct enough to eliminate assault suspects.\"It's like when you buy a packet of M&M's, you know that there are six colors in every packet, so you might say they're identical from the outside,\" she said.\"However, each packet has a different number of each color\u2014one might have five blue, while another only three\u2014and it goes the same for each color.\"It's similar when it comes to bacteria, although male bacteria may look relatively similar at a glance, we found the composition of each person's bacterial makeup is probably different enough to use for identification.\"Chapman said the findings could have a significant real-world impact on investigations.\"This research is a big step forward for forensic science and has the potential to lead to breakthroughs in cases that involve sexual assault,\" he said.\"We've demonstrated the concept, and the plan is to further investigate uniqueness of individual bacterial fingerprints and the effect of things like contraception and non-heterosexual couples.\"The fact is, we have now demonstrated that bacteria may be just as powerful as conventional forensic DNA but with the added benefit of being available even when male human DNA is undetectable.\"Dixon said the next stage of the research will further assess how the new technique can be implemented on a national scale.

  "answer_squad": " waixenicin A",
  "text": "Chemists led by Thomas Magauer at the University of Innsbruck succeeded in synthesizing the natural product waixenicin A for the first time. This molecule is found in soft corals and is of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry due to its potential medical applications. The study is published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.          Soft corals are a rich source of bioactive natural products. The genus Xenia produces the so-called Xenia diterpenoids, which are characterized by their structural complexity and diverse biological activities. Due to their promising activities, pharmaceutical companies are also showing increasing interest in them\u2014some Xenia diterpenoids feature anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, for instance. The first representatives of these substances were isolated as early as 1977, however, they have only been studied to a limited extent.The biggest challenge is the low availability of natural sources. Many marine organisms, including corals, are largely impossible to cultivate. Large-scale extraction of Xenia diterpenoids from corals in nature would represent an enormous impairment of their sensitive ecosystem. Several attempts to produce the complex molecular structures in the laboratory have failed, and to date only a handful syntheses of structurally simplified modifications have been described in the literature.Inhibition of ion channelIn 2014, the group of Thomas Magauer started their research on the synthesis of waixenicin A. The goal was to develop a flexible synthetic strategy to this natural product and to explore its mode of action as well as potential for drug development.Waixenicin A is a unique member of the Xenia diterpenoids and was first isolated from the Hawaiian octocoral Anthelia edmondsoni at Harvard Medical School in 1984. Initial testing in 2011 revealed that waixenicin A is a selective and highly potent inhibitor of the TRPM7 ion channel. Ion channels play an essential role in various biological processes, including neural signaling and the perception of a wide variety of sensations such as heat, taste, and pain.Earlier work on herbicides leads to successMagauer's group finally succeeded in synthesizing waixenicin A in the laboratory in April 2023. The synthesis was very challenging due to the special properties of the natural product but was finally accomplished with the help of an efficient synthetic strategy that Magauer's group had established during previous work in the area of herbicides.Despite early progress and a significant breakthrough in 2017, the desired bicyclic scaffold was not accessible in the laboratory. The presence of several labile functional groups as well as a strained nine-membered ring prevented the successful synthesis for several years.Eventually, a solution based on an earlier study on the synthesis of the herbicide Cornexistin was developed. The use of an intramolecular ring closure enabled efficient assembly of the desired molecular scaffold. Sequential functionalization of a key bicyclic intermediate allowed selective incorporation of the side chain and completed the first synthesis of waixenicin A. Further diversification of the key intermediate provided access to two additional Xenia diterpenoids: 9-Deacetoxy-14,15-deepoxyxeniculine and Xeniafaraunol A. Particularly intriguing was the conversion to Xeniafaraunol A, which could be performed in only one step. The significance of this step for the biosynthesis and the biological activity is yet unexplored, so exciting research questions are guaranteed.The Magauer group is currently optimizing the developed route and is working on the synthesis of a unique substance library. In collaboration with Susanna Zierler's group, the latter will be investigated for its inhibitory effect on the TRPM ion channel. Additional binding studies will provide important insights into the mode of action of this fascinating family of natural products.

  "text": "A research group has developed a neural device that detects specific neurotransmitters in the brain with high sensitivity and selectivity by combining multifunctional fibers and DNA molecular probes. Details of the research were published in the journal Analytical Chemistry on April 24, 2023.          It is estimated that more than a billion people suffer from brain disorders worldwide. Current therapeutic techniques use electrical modalities to establish an interface with the brain. This typically involves electrodes being used to read electrical potential or deliver electrical currents to specific tissues in the body.However, cells inside the brain communicate with one another via chemical signals, and thus researchers have been looking for ways to measure and manipulate both the electrical and chemical signals.One such breakthrough in this regard has been microscopic, thermally-drawn microelectronic fiber-based neural probes that can act as an interface with the brain across electrical, chemical, optical, and mechanical modalities. Still, the capabilities of this technology for studying intrinsic in-brain chemistry have yet to be explored, and few attempts have studied how it could be integrated with multi-modal and multi-level brain studies.\"We expanded the capabilities of the fibers to include neurochemical sensing,\" says Dr. Yuanyuan Guo, associate professor at Tohoku University's Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences (FRIS), and leader of the research group. \"We coupled aptamers, a new type of biosensor comprising a single strand of synthetic DNA with customizable sequences, on the microelectronic fibers. These defined aptamers sense neurochemicals with high sensitivity and high selectivity.\"Aptamers can be thought of as keys that specifically unlock the locks of certain target molecules. Like a key fits into a specific lock and opens it, an aptamer can bind to a specific molecule and interact with it in a selective manner.In the study, the defined aptamer sequences bound to specific molecules with a high affinity, inducing a reversible three-dimensional conformational change from a relatively simple chain structure into a complex structure wrapping around targets. Aptamers were tagged with ferrocene as an electrochemical readout for target molecule and aptamer binding.The research group focused on dopamine due to its physiological significance in mediating learning behavior and motivation. But Guo points out that this sensing mechanism is applicable to other molecules regardless of their charge or electrochemical profile. \"Our discovery provides a universal method for fiber surface modification, to monitor wide-range molecules of interest.\"Ultimately, the breakthrough will hopefully enable the development of new brain research and methods for the prevention and treatment of diseases of the brain and organs that have not been elucidated to date.

  "answer_squad": " Organic chemistry",
  "text": "Organic chemistry, the study of carbon-based molecules, underlies not only the science of living organisms, but is critical for many current and future technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays. Understanding the electronic structure of a material's molecules is key to predicting the material's chemical properties.          In a study recently published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry by researchers at the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, a machine-learning algorithm was developed to predict the density of states within an organic molecule, i.e., the number of energy levels that electrons can occupy in the ground state within a material's molecules. These predictions, based on spectral data, can be of great help to organic chemists and materials scientists when analyzing carbon-based molecules.The experimental techniques often used to find the density of states can be difficult to interpret. This is particularly true for the method known as core-loss spectroscopy, which combines energy loss near-edge spectroscopy (ELNES) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). These methods irradiate a beam of electrons or X-rays at a sample of material; the resulting scatter of electrons and measurements of energy emitted by the material's molecules allow the density of states the molecule of interest to be measured. However, information the spectrum has is only at the electron absent (unoccupied) states of the excited molecules.To address this issue, the team at the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, trained a neural network machine-learning model to analyze the core-loss spectroscopy data and predict the density of electronic states. First, a database was constructed by calculating the densities of states and corresponding core-loss spectra for over 22,000 molecules. They also added some simulated noise. Then, the algorithm was trained on core-loss spectra and optimized to predict the correct density of states of both occupied and unoccupied states at the ground state.\"We attempted to extrapolate predictions for larger molecules using a model trained by smaller molecules. We discovered that the accuracy can be improved by excluding tiny molecules,\" explains lead author Po-Yen Chen.The team also found that by using smoothing preprocessing and adding specific noise to the data, the predictions of density of state can be improved, which can accelerate adoption of the prediction model for use on real data.\"Our work can help researchers understand the material properties of molecules and accelerate the design of functional molecules,\" senior author Teruyasu Mizoguchi says. This can include pharmaceuticals and other exciting compounds. More information:Machine Learning Lets Researchers See Beyond the Spectrum, The Journal of Physical Chemistry (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the cutting edge instrument at Argonne?",
  "answer_squad": " Bionanoprobe",
  "text": "The discovery that zinc is involved in the fertilization process earlier than initially thought was made with the help of the Bionanoprobe, a cutting-edge instrument at Argonne.          To make a baby, first you need an egg. To have an egg, there needs to be a follicle. And in the very beginning of follicle development, there needs to be zinc.The last of those statements represents the new findings reported recently by a team of researchers from Michigan State University, Northwestern University and the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory. The research builds upon earlier work looking at the role of zinc in fertilization and uncovers the importance of the metal earlier in the process of ovulation.The results were reported in a paper in the Journal of Biological Chemistry that looked at the role of zinc in follicle development. The researchers, led by Teresa Woodruff and Tom O'Halloran of Michigan State University, used the Bionanoprobe at Argonne's Advanced Photon Source (APS) to examine zinc and other trace elements in the egg cell itself as well as surrounding somatic cells.The researchers observed that the concentration of zinc in mouse follicles more than triples as they go through their development, while concentrations of other trace elements such as iron and copper increased to a lesser extent. The researchers also noticed that growing follicles acquired zinc at a rate 70 times faster than undeveloped follicles, suggesting a key role for zinc in the maturation of ovarian follicles.\"We had known from earlier research that zinc played an important role in fertilization, but this new research shows that it's involved way before egg meets sperm,\" said Argonne staff scientist Si Chen, an author of the study.\"This study is a beautiful example of how synchrotron-based science can open new fundamental understandings of biology, of reproduction, and of metabolism of disease,\" said Michigan State microbiology professor Tom O'Halloran. \"When you're working with photons and X-ray beams, you might not always initially understand the connection to actual physiology\u2014but this is really at the cutting edge of bringing new tools to the biology community.\"      The Bionanoprobe is one of a few facilities in the world where researchers can measure the concentration of different elements within a cell's organelles in cryogenic conditions, Chen said. \"Being able to resolve subcellular compartments is important for understanding what's going on behind the scenes as the follicle develops,\" she said.The importance of zinc for follicle development is related to the fact that there are zinc-activated proteins that control the process, according to Chen. \"Transient fluctuations in the amount of zinc in a cell can provide important signaling pathways for the next steps in development,\" she said.The researchers also observed that the egg has ways of regulating how much zinc is allocated to specific subcellular locations. \"The zinc levels need to be kept in a certain range for the follicle to develop normally,\" Chen said. \"Just like in the rest of our bodies, there are certain optimal conditions, or homeostasis, that needs to be achieved.\"At the Bionanoprobe, the researchers used X-ray fluorescence microscopy to measure the zinc concentrations.The results may have implications for future studies on human fertility. \"The production of follicles is essential to human reproduction,\" Chen said. \"Gaining a better understanding of how they develop could potentially lead to better reproductive medicine.\"\"There are a lot of mysteries about what the signals are that tell which follicle to mature and be ovulated,\" O'Halloran said. \"This process is rooted in a deeper biological story about which we are just beginning to uncover the foundations.\"According to O'Halloran, the upcoming upgrade of the APS will give scientists access to a more intense beam that will produce a 100 times greater sensitivity to zinc, allowing for an even faster and more precise structural determination of chemical signatures.\"Because there's so much biological variability between cells as they go through differentiation and developmental processes, you need to image a large number of sections to get a statistically representative sample,\" he said. \"With the upgraded APS, we'll have more samples being measured per minute of beam time, with higher sensitivity and better spatial resolution.\" More information:Yu-Ying Chen et al, Zinc dynamics regulate early ovarian follicle development, Journal of Biological Chemistry (2022).

  "text": "Common inflammatory disorders such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease can be diagnosed or monitored by measuring the protein calprotectin in stool samples, while serum levels of calprotectin could be used to monitor the inflammation status in rheumatoid arthritis. Calprotectin concentrations in patient samples are typically determined using antibodies that bind and detect the protein, for example, in lateral flow assays like the now all-too-familiar home COVID-19 test kits.       But there is a problem with antibody-based calprotectin assays: The results can vary depending on the type of antibody and assay used. This happens because antibodies may bind to different sites on the protein, or might not have a uniform composition. The antibodies can also become inactivated over time due to unfolding or precipitation.One possible solution is to use peptides instead of antibodies to detect and measure disease markers like calprotectin. Peptides are sequences of up to 50 amino acids that can bind to proteins with high affinity and selectivity, but unlike antibodies, they can be chemically produced with high purity and homogeneity. In addition, peptides are stable over time, are cheaper to produce than antibodies and with lower inter-batch variability, and they can be attached to a specific location on a surface, significantly simplifying diagnostic assay development because it allows for a more accurate and controlled way of detecting biomarkers.A lateral flow assay for calprotectin. Credit: Christian Heinis (EPFL)/Jo\u00eblle Jourdan (B\u00dcHLMANN AG)With this idea, Christian Gerhold, CTO of the diagnostics company B\u00dcHLMANN, worked with the group of Professor Christian Heinis at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) to develop human calprotectin ligands based on peptides. From a library of more than 500 billion different peptides, Cristina Diaz-Perlas, a postdoc in Heinis's group, isolated several binders of calprotectin, and showed that the peptides are suited for calprotectin quantification in simplified lateral flow assays. The best peptide had a dissociation constant of 26 nM\u2014a measure of how tightly it binds calprotectin, making it a good candidate for diagnostic tests.The peptide not only binds to a large surface region of calprotectin but also to a specific form of calprotectin that is the relevant species in patient samples. Under the guidance of Benjamin Ricken at B\u00dcHLMANN, the peptide was finally tested in professionally assembled lateral flow cassettes and found that it was suited for accurate detection and quantification of calprotectin. In a proof-of-concept study, this setup was used to quantify the concentration of calprotectin in serum obtained from patient blood samples.The peptide developed is the first synthetic affinity reagent that could be generated against the biomarker calprotectin. \"The EPFL and B\u00dcHLMANN teams are currently performing more tests with the calprotectin-specific peptide to translate the assay into a product that can bring the diagnostic power of this increasingly important biomarker to a new level to help patients suffering from inflammatory diseases,\" says Christian Heinis.Christian Gerhold adds, \"This collaboration greatly benefited from B\u00dcHLMANN's knowhow to produce and handle the biomarker, and expertise of the EPFL team to generate and screen large combinatorial libraries of peptides by phage display.\" More information:Cristina D\u00edaz-Perlas, High-affinity peptides developed against calprotectin and their application as synthetic ligands in diagnostic assays., Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "Research has shown that a thin cellulose film can inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus within minutes, inhibit the growth of bacteria including E. coli, and mitigate contact transfer of pathogens.          The coating consists of a thin film of cellulose fiber that is invisible to the naked eye, and is abrasion-resistant under dry conditions, making it suitable for use on high traffic objects such as door handles and handrails.The coating was developed by scientific teams from the University of Birmingham, Cambridge University, and FiberLean Technologies, who worked on a project to formulate treatments for glass, metal or laminate surfaces that would deliver long-lasting protection against the COVID-19 virus.While conventional chemical disinfectants and antiviral surface designs target either the structural proteins or nucleic acids, the researchers, led by Professor Zhenyu Jason Zhang, from Birmingham's School of Chemical Engineering, focused on drying out the respiratory droplets that contain the viruses by the capillary force introduced by the porous structure.The COVID-19 virus is known to remain active for several days on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel, but for only a few hours on newspaper. The team, which has expertise in surface chemistry and formulation engineering, investigated the structure and performance of a coating made from micro-fibrillated cellulose (MFC) provided by FiberLean Technologies, the leading global producer of MFC for the paper and packaging industry.The researchers found that the porous nature of the film plays a significant role: it accelerates the evaporation rate of liquid droplets, and introduces an imbalanced osmotic pressure across bacteria membrane.They then tested whether the coating could inhibit surface transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Here they found a three-fold reduction of infectivity when droplets containing the virus were left on the coating for 5 minutes, and, after 10 minutes, the infectivity fell to zero.By contrast when droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 were left on a glass surface, their initial infectivity was still maintained after 10 minutes. The antimicrobial tests were repeated with droplets containing bacteria (E. coli and S. epidermidis), and here again, the researchers saw substantial reductions in infectivity at 1 hour and 24 hours.The experiments were repeated with aerosolized artificial saliva, and here the analysis suggested that the cellulose thin film is also effective in suppressing the contact transfer of respiratory aerosols.Professor Zhang commented, \"The risk of surface transmission, as opposed to aerosol transmission, comes from large droplets which remain infective if they land on hard surfaces, where they can be transferred by touch. This surface coating technology uses sustainable materials and could potentially be used in conjunction with other antimicrobial actives to deliver a long-lasting and slow-release antimicrobial effect.\"The researchers confirmed the stability of the coating by mechanical scraping tests, where the coating showed no noticeable damage when dry, but easy removal from the surface when wetted, making it convenient and suitable for daily cleaning and disinfection practice.The paper is published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the ligand used to synthesize VT coordination polymers?",
  "answer_squad": " photoisomerizable",
  "text": "In a study published in the journal National Science Review and led by Dr. Zhao-Yang Li (School of Material Science and Engineering, Nankai University) and Prof. Masahiro Yamashita (Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University), a photoisomerizable ligand was used to synthesize two VT coordination polymers, which display VT and photoconversion behavior.          Two crystallographically independent SQ\u00b7\u2013 radicals arranged along the 1D chain were observed in the open-form complex using SC-XRD. Therefore, two clearly distinct radical signals were observed in the high-field/-frequency single-crystal EPR spectra of a VT complex for the first time.In their strategy, a pyridyl derivative of a diarylethene (DAE) ligand was used as the linker along with the Co-dioxolene unit, which is a classical VT building block, to form a VT CP with a chain structure. Light may promote the rearrangement of the crystal structure and further influence magnetic properties through modification of the ligand field (isomers differ substantially in shape and conjugation), leading to photocontrol and deep insight into organic radicals on a 1D chain.An open-form and a closed-form complex were synthesized. Photoconversion between the open- and closed-form species (ligands and complexes) due to the effect of DAE ligand photoisomerization was explored through UV/vis absorption spectroscopy.Notably, the 1D chains in the two types of complexes differ due to the open and closed forms of the 6F-DAE-py2 ligand. The open-form complex exhibits a zigzag 1D structure, while the closed-form complex displays quasi-linear characteristics. In the study of SC-XRD, two types of crystallographically distinct SQ\u00b7\u2013 radicals, referred to as Radical 1 and Radical 2, are observed in the chains of the open-form complex due to their zigzag configurations.They used high-field (~13.3 T) and -frequency (~360 GHz) single-crystal EPR spectroscopy to significantly enhance the resolution of Zeeman splitting in the open-form complex, which led to the observation of a remarkable phenomenon. Dual SQ\u00b7\u2013 radical signals were directly visualized when the c-axis was aligned with the static field.Furthermore, angle-dependent EPR spectroscopy was carried out. The directional variations of these dual radicals, as well as their 180\u00b0 periods, were confirmed. To conveniently investigate the two directional radicals, they determined the face index of a single crystal of the open-form complex. In this way, they confirmed the gz value of Radical 1 and distinguished the g1 and g2 values obtained in high-field and high-frequency EPR spectroscopy.Interestingly, a synergistic effect between valence tautomerism and semi-conductivity was found in magnetic and electronic studies. Electrical conductivity increased with increasing temperature below the transition temperature, which is a characteristic semiconductor behavior. However, electrical conductivity was observed to decrease with increasing temperature above 330 K, which is ascribable to electron transfer during valence tautomerism.Such behavior was observed for the first time in a single-crystal VT complex. The Arrhenius analysis determined the origin of the semiconductive behavior before 330 K, while DFT calculations helped illustrate the mechanism of the unusual change in electrical conductivity during the VT transition process.This study presents the first example of dual-radical-based molecular anisotropy and charge-transfer-induced conductive anisotropy in a photoswitchable coordination polymer. It is of considerable significance with regard to the anisotropy and synthesis of multifunctional bistable magnetic materials in the molecular magnetism field.

  "text": "Don't be surprised to see pills with unusual shapes in the future. At first sight they may look funny, but they can release pharmaceuticals inside the body in a controlled manner. Using a combination of advanced computational methods and 3D printing, objects can be produced that dissolve in liquids in a predetermined format.          A group of Computer Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany, and the University of California at Davis, have invented a process that relies solely on the shape of the object for a time-controlled release. This will have important implications for the pharmaceutical industry, which has recently begun focusing sharply on 3D printing.Funny looking pills are not a design gimmick, they can release medication in a desired time regime. Controlling pharmaceutical drug levels in patients is an important part of medication. In the case of intravenous infusion, the concentration in the blood is determined by the drip rate multiplied with the proportion of the drug in the IV solution. A constant drug level might be achieved by initially administrating a large dose and maintaining it from then on by smaller doses. With oral administration, this regime is much more difficult to ensure.One idea would be to use multi-component, multi-material structures with different drug concentrations at different locations, which is difficult to manufacture. On the other hand, great advances in 3D printing and its insurmountable capabilities for creating complex shapes, making free-form drugs with a constant distribution of the biochemical in the carrier material is currently a viable option. For such drugs, the release depends solely on the geometric shape, which is easier to ensure and control.The project, led by Dr. Vahid Babaei (MPI for Informatics) and Prof. Julian Panetta (UC Davis), produces 3D objects that dissolve in a desired function of time, hence releasing their content in a controlled way. By cleverly combining mathematical modeling, experimental setup and 3D printing, the team can print 3D shapes that deliver a timed amount of drug as they dissolve. This can be used to set predetermined drug concentrations through oral delivery.Since no external influence is possible after ingestion in the digestive tract, the desired time-dependent drug release must be generated by the shape (active surface that dissolves) of the specimen. With some effort, the time-dependent dissolution can be calculated from a given geometric shape. For a sphere, for example, it is strictly proportional to the decreasing spherical surface.      The research team proposes a forward simulation, based on a geometric intuition that objects are dissolved one layer at a time. Practitioners are, however, mostly interested in defining a desired release first and then finding a shape that dissolves according to that release profile. Even with this efficient forward simulation, the reverse engineering to find the appropriate three-dimensional shape for a desired drug regime has significant difficulties.This is where topology optimization (TO) finds application: forward simulations are inverted to find a shape that exhibits a certain property. Originally developed for mechanical components, TO has meanwhile gained a wide range of applications. The team is the first to propose an inverse design strategy to find the shape from release behavior based on topology optimization. The dissolution is validated by means of experiments: the measured release curves are very close to the desired values.In the experimental setup, the objects are printed using a filament based 3D printer. The dissolution is then evaluated by a camera system, i.e., actually measured, not just calculated by a mathematical model. For this purpose, the optical transmittance of the solvent is optically recorded. In contrast to the measurement methods commonly used to date, which directly determine the active ingredient concentration (e.g., by titrating), this method is much faster and simpler to set up. Optical methods for measuring the density of active ingredients have, by the way, been in use for quite some time: when grapes are mashed for making wine, the sugar content (\u00d6chsle) of the grape juice is determined by refractometry.The inverse design method can also incorporate different fabricability constraints of different manufacturing systems. For example, it can be modified to generate extruded shapes and thus does not stand in the way of mass production. Beyond the discussed application in pharmaceutics, further possibilities include the production of catalytic bodies or even coarse granular fertilizers.

  "text": "In the face of increasing global scarcity of freshwater resources, desalination is considered one of the most effective ways to alleviate this problem. However, it does come with a catch\u2014efficient and low-cost evaporation materials are key to achieving large-scale applications.          Hydrogels present a promising opportunity, yet conventional uses of these in interfacial solar evaporators still lack the ability to satisfy the trade-off for high evaporation rate, salt resistance and durable mechanical properties.Therefore, most traditional hydrogel materials are only suitable for low-salinity brine, far from the requirements of long-term evaporation and treatment of industrial high-salinity wastewater. It has been demonstrated that the salt resistance of hydrogels can be enhanced by constructing interpenetrating 3D macropore structure.Nonetheless, rapid water transport and high water content can lead to increased conductive heat loss. This problem can be solved by further designing the Janus structure. Furthermore, although various methods for creating such structures exist, they are often complex and lack surface stability.To that end, a team of researchers from the School of Chemical Engineering and Technology at Hebei University of Technology in Tianjin, China, introduced hydrophobic fumed nano-silica aerogel (SA) into the hydrogel production process. The ultra-lightweight and super-hydrophobic properties of SA enable it to spontaneously migrate and aggregate to the upper region of the hydrogel during the gelation process, forming a Janus structure.\"We know that the regulation of pore structure can also balance the problem of increased heat loss caused by the high salt resistance of the sponge-like hydrogel,\" explained Aqiang Chu, lead author of the study published in Green Energy & Environment. \"Consequently, we incorporated agar (AG) to enhance the comprehensive performance of hydrogel evaporators.\"Notably, AG has a thickening function, which in this case stabilizes the bubble structure formed during the foaming process, and thus help regulate the pore structure of the hydrogel.\"The large number of hydroxyl groups on the AG chain can at once reduce the enthalpy of water evaporation by interacting with water and forming ether bonds with polyvinyl alcohol to form a robust cross-linked network, contributing to improved mechanical properties,\" Chu explained further.\"Coupled with the low cost and environmental friendliness of these preparation materials, our Janus dual-network sponge-like hydrogel solar evaporator shows great potential for practical applications in the field of interfacial solar evaporation,\" added corresponding author Hao Li.

The China-led team said the dye, which has yet to be tested as an antidote on humans but has already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for other uses, has the potential to \"save many lives\".Amanita phalloides, commonly known as death caps, are estimated to cause more than 90 percent of all deaths from mushroom poisoning worldwide.They often resemble other species of mushrooms that people like to pick in the wild\u2014but eating just half of one can cause deadly failure of the liver or kidneys.While originally native to Europe, death caps have spread across the world, causing more than 38,000 illnesses and nearly 800 deaths in China alone between 2010 and 2020.For a new study published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers sought to target alpha-amanitin, the main toxin produced by the mushrooms.They used genome-wide CRISPR screening, a relatively new technique that has helped researchers understand the role specific genes play in infections and poisonings.The team had previously used the technology to find a potential antidote for the box jellyfish, one of the world's most venomous animals.The CRISPR screening identified that the protein STT3B was a key culprit in the toxic effects of death cap poisoning.The team searched through a database of drugs already approved by the US FDA and found one that could potentially block the protein.'Unexpected connection'It is a fluorescent dye called indocyanine green, which is administered intravenously. It has been widely used for decades in the US, Europe and elsewhere for diagnostic imaging, allowing doctors to measure liver and heart function.Qiaoping Wang, a researcher at China's Sun Yat-sen University and senior author of the study, told AFP that \"upon discovering this unexpected connection, the research team was understandably taken aback\".The team tested the antidote first on liver cells in a petri dish, then on mice.In both cases, it \"demonstrated significant potential in mitigating the toxic impact\" of mushroom poisoning, Wang said.\"This molecule holds immense potential for treating cases of human mushroom poisoning and could mark the first-ever specific antidote with a targeted protein,\" he said.\"It could save many lives if it is as effective in humans as in mice.\"The team now intends to conduct trials on humans using the dye as a death cap antidote.An extract from milk thistle seeds called silibinin has previously been used to treat death cap poisoning, but exactly how it works has remained unclear.

  "text": "While many materials melt when heated, researchers from Japan recently discovered a novel material in which melting can be induced by ultraviolet light instead of heat. Even more intriguing, this material exhibits changes in its luminescent properties while it melts. This material is the first organic crystalline material found to show changes in luminescent color and intensity upon ultraviolet light-induced melting.          Investigators from Osaka University reported their discovery of this new class of photo-responsive crystal compounds, \"heteroaromatic 1,2-diketones,\" in Chemical Science on April 20. Light irradiation causes the crystals in these materials to melt, a phenomenon termed photo-induced crystal-to-liquid transition (PCLT).This phenomenon can dramatically change a material's properties and makes possible a broad range of applications, for example, photo-responsive, reversible adhesives that could be controlled by light. Few materials have been shown to have this crystal-melting property; hence, the discovery of a new class of PCLT materials is a great step forward in this field.In characterizing their newly discovered class of PCLT materials, the researchers found that one member of this class, the diketone SO, shows changes in luminescence during the irradiation-induced melting process. \"This is the first organic crystal we know of that exhibits a luminescent evolution during crystal melting, showing changes in intensity and color, from green to yellow,\" says lead author Mao Komura.Real-time observation of crystal melting with luminescence evolution. Credit: Osaka UniversityThese changes in luminescence, i.e., changes in the way the material absorbs and emits light, indicated that SO was undergoing molecular-level changes in shape during the PCLT process. Building upon past research on luminescent molecules, the research team realized they could further investigate these molecular-level changes underlying PCLT to better understand the crystal-melting phenomenon.\"We found that the changes in luminescence arise from sequential processes of crystal loosening and conformational changes prior to melting,\" explains senior author Yosuke Tani. \"These visual indications of the steps of the PCLT process enabled us to advance the current understanding of crystal melting at the molecular level.\"By applying single-crystal X-ray analysis, thermodynamic property analysis, and theoretical calculations to probe the mechanisms governing the behavior of this new PCLT material, the researchers demonstrated that a disordered layer in the crystal is a key factor for PCLT in this class of materials.

This is important for understanding how healthy cells work and how infections or cancer can affect them.\"We're really excited about this because it will help us better understand how cells communicate with each other, and this knowledge could lead to new ways to fight diseases.\"SEISMIC enables single-cell and sub-cellular analysis, which will help scientists understand what happens under defined conditions and how cells signal to each other.Dr. Dany Beste, Senior Lecturer in Microbial Metabolism at the University of Surrey, said, \"The new facility is free for academics working in BBSRC-funded areas and also available to scientists in industry. We are confident SEISMIC will enhance scientific training in single-cell work and overcome some of the challenges in this area.\"SEISMIC is the University of Surrey's third national research facility with the Ion Beam Center and the Environmental Flow Laboratory.Prof. Bailey said, \"The combination of SEISMIC, the proton beam facility and the Ion Beam Center are a boon to Surrey's scientific and business communities and could allow us to understand the interaction between cancer cells and radiation in more detail.

  "text": "Researchers at Kanazawa University report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences high-speed atomic force microscopy experiments that show how ligands associated with stimulating and suppressing activation of the TRPV1 protein increase and decrease the molecule's structural variations. The observations provide insights into how these heat- and chili-sensing proteins function.          The skin senses heat\u2014both from increased temperature and molecules like capsaicin in chilies\u2014through the activation of protein receptors called Transient receptor potential vanilloid member 1 (TRPV1). However, the mechanisms behind the function of TRPV1 have not been clear. Now Ayumi Sumino at Kanazawa University in Japan and Motoyuki Hattori at the Fudan University in China and their colleagues provide important insights into this mechanism.Using high-speed atomic force microscopy to compare the protein with and without stimulating or suppressing molecules\u2014ligands\u2014bound to it, they obtain what they describe as \"the first experimental evidence showing the correlation between molecular fluctuation and the gating state (ligand binding).\"Once activated, the TRPV1 channel opens, allowing ions to permeate and signaling to the nervous system that a noxious stimulant is present. In 2011 researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the U.S. put forward a theoretical basis for the activation of the receptor derived from thermodynamics, a theoretical framework that has since been corroborated by experiment.The idea was that the molecule would respond to heat with a change in heat capacity, which is related to the fluctuations in the molecule's conformation. Structures for the TRPV1 protein were known from previous cryo electron microscopy studies but these did not clarify how the fluctuations in protein conformation might change with stimulating or suppressing molecules, or even whether temperature and chili sensing shared the same molecular mechanism.Atomic force microscopy (AFM) senses the topology of surfaces through the effect of distance on the forces on a nanosized tip positioned directly above the surface. The microscope was first invented in 1986 but was revived through work at Kanazawa University that enabled it to capture topologies at high speed thereby providing a window into the dynamics of structures.Sumino, Hattori and colleagues used high-speed AFM to image the TRPV1 receptor both in its unbound state and when bound to ligand molecules that either stimulate (agonist) or suppress (antagonist) the protein's activity. They used the molecule resiniferatoxin, which is 1,000 times hotter than capsaicin, as the agonist and for the antagonist they used capsazepine, which blocks the pain of capsaicin.From the structures captured the researchers were able to observe fluctuations in the conformation of both the bound and unbound states of TRPV1. They found that resiniferatoxin increases conformational fluctuations, while capsazepine suppresses them.Although the conformational fluctuations were very small\u2014at around an Angstrom\u2014the researchers highlight evidence in the literature of conformational changes at this scale being sufficient to affect the ion permeability of a channel. In their report of the work, the researchers conclude, \"Overall, this study suggests the importance of structural fluctuation, which would be a key factor for the heat-sensing of TRPV1.\" More information:Ayumi Sumino et al, Antithetic effects of agonists and antagonists on the structural fluctuations of TRPV1 channel, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the catalyst that was discovered to be able to split water molecules?",
  "answer_squad": " pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rhodium complex",
  "text": "Hydrogen, the simplest element on Earth, is a clean fuel that could revolutionize the energy industry. Accessing hydrogen, however, is not a simple or clean process at all. Pure hydrogen is extremely rare in nature, and practical methods to produce it currently rely on fossil fuels. But if scientists find the right chemical catalyst, one that can split the hydrogen and oxygen in water molecules apart, pure hydrogen could be produced from renewable energy sources such as solar power.          Now, scientists are one step closer to finding that catalyst. Chemists at the University of Kansas and the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory have unraveled the entire reaction mechanism for a key class of water-splitting catalysts. Their work was published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\"It's very rare that you can get a complete understanding of a full catalytic cycle,\" said Brookhaven chemist Dmitry Polyansky, a co-author of the paper. \"These reactions go through many steps, some of which are very fast and cannot be easily observed.\"Rapid intermediate steps make it difficult for scientists to decipher exactly where, when, and how the most important parts of a catalytic reaction occur\u2014and therefore, if the catalyst is suitable for large-scale applications.At the University of Kansas, associate professor James Blakemore was researching possible candidates when he noticed something unusual about one catalyst in particular. This catalyst, called a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rhodium complex, or Cp*Rh complex, was demonstrating reactivity in an area where molecules are usually stable.\"Metal complexes\u2014molecules that contain a metal center surrounded by an organic scaffold\u2014are important for their ability to catalyze otherwise difficult reactions,\" said Blakemore, who is also a co-author of the paper. \"Typically, reactivity happens directly at the metal center, but in our system of interest, the ligand scaffold appeared to directly take part in the chemistry.\"So, what exactly was reacting with the ligand? Was the team really observing an active step in the reaction mechanism or just an undesirable side reaction? How stable were the intermediate products that were produced? To answer questions like these, Blakemore collaborated with chemists at Brookhaven Lab to use a specialized research technique called pulse radiolysis.Pulse radiolysis harnesses the power of particle accelerators to isolate rapid, hard-to-observe steps within a catalytic cycle. Brookhaven's Accelerator Center for Energy Research (ACER) is one of only two locations in the United States where this technique can be conducted, thanks to the Lab's advanced particle accelerator complex.      \"We accelerate electrons, which carry significant energy, to very high velocities,\" said Brookhaven chemist David Grills, another co-author of the paper. \"When these electrons pass through the chemical solution we're studying, they ionize the solvent molecules, generating charged species that are intercepted by the catalyst molecules, which rapidly alter in structure. We then use time-resolved spectroscopy tools to monitor the chemical reactivity after this rapid change occurs.\"Spectroscopic studies provide spectral data, which can be thought of as the fingerprints of a molecule's structure. By comparing these signatures to known structures, scientists can decipher physical and electronic changes within the short-lived intermediate products of catalytic reactions.\"Pulse radiolysis allows us to single out one step and look at it on a very short timescale,\" Polyansky said. \"The instrumentation we used can resolve events at one millionth to one billionth of a second.\"By combining pulse radiolysis and time-resolved spectroscopy with more common electrochemistry and stopped-flow techniques, the team was able to decipher every step of the complex catalytic cycle, including the details of the unusual reactivity occurring at the ligand scaffold.\"One of the most remarkable features of this catalytic cycle was direct involvement of the ligands,\" Grills said. \"Often, this area of the molecule is just a spectator, but we observed reactivity within the ligands that had not yet been proven for this class of compounds. We were able to show that a hydride group, an intermediate product of the reaction, jumped onto the Cp* ligand. This proved that the Cp* ligand was an active part of the reaction mechanism.\"Capturing these precise chemical details will make it significantly easier for scientists to design more efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for producing pure hydrogen.The researchers also hope their findings will provide clues for deciphering reaction mechanisms for other classes of catalysts.\"In chemistry, findings like ours can often be generalized and applied to optimize other systems, but obtaining critical details on rapid reactivity, like we have done here, is a key step,\" Blakemore said. \"We hope other research groups will take our insights and build on them, perhaps by using ligand-promoted reactivity to build better catalysts.\"This study is just one set of experiments among a large body of clean energy work that scientists at the University of Kansas and Brookhaven Lab are conducting.\"We're building the fundamental chemical knowledge that will, one day, help scientists design the optimal catalyst for producing pure hydrogen,\" Polyansky said.

  "answer_race": " EMIS--a new kind of isotope separator",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the lab that produces the components for EMIS-3?",
  "answer_squad": " ORNL",
  "text": "Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)'s electromagnetic isotope separator, or EMIS, made history in 2018 when it produced 500 milligrams of the rare isotope ruthenium-96, unavailable anywhere else in the world.          And EMIS technology just keeps getting better, said Brian Egle, who heads the Enrichment Science and Engineering Division's Stable Isotope Research, Development and Production Section.\"It's capable of, essentially, separating the whole periodic table,\" he said.In an EMIS, elements are put into gas form and positively electrically charged, then put through a magnetic field, which separates them by mass. Each isotope, having a different weight, travels through the field at a slightly different radius, allowing the different isotopes to be collected separately.The technology was developed to fill a gap left by the 1998 closure of the Manhattan Project-era calutron facility at Y-12, which produced the now-dwindling U.S. stockpile of stable isotopes. EMIS development is intended to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign suppliers for rare, hard-to-produce stable isotopes. EMIS now can match or exceed the quality of isotopes produced at the calutrons.Egle came to ORNL in 2010 to work on the first-generation of EMIS, still in use at the lab. He's since worked on second- and third-generation EMIS\u2014each better than the last, he said.While the original EMIS could separate isotopes of any element at decent resolution, the third-generation machine is optimized for separating elements at the heavier end of the periodic table, such as ytterbium, whose isotope Yb-176 is used in nuclear medicine and radiography.Moreover, it can separate all the isotopes of ytterbium simultaneously, whereas the calutrons went through a series of separations and were able to capture only every other isotope\u2014even or odd numbers.Other isotopes of ytterbium, for example, are used in quantum memory, Egle said. EMIS-3 can produce them all. That's important because particular isotopes with no previously known use may be crucial in the future.\"Things that were not the target isotope 40 years ago that we have in inventory can all of a sudden become the enabler for future science,\" Egle said. \"We absolutely never throw any isotopes away if we can help it.\"                In 2018, ORNL's EMIS produced 500 milligrams of the rare isotope ruthenium-96, unavailable anywhere else in the world. Credit: ORNL/U.S. Dept. of Energy             Unlike the calutrons, EMIS are automated, so the associated labor cost is expected to be lower. And while the calutrons were linked together, each EMIS can run independently, so multiple isotopes can be produced at the same time\u2014for example, a medical isotope alongside a national security isotope such as nickel-63, used for detecting explosives at airports.\"At DOE's discretion, we could have three machines running ytterbium, three running nickel, and one running a small amount of a rare isotope needed for research,\" Egle said. \"They're all independent machines that can be doing independent missions in the same facility simultaneously.\"EMIS features prominently in plans for the Stable Isotope Production and Research Center, or SIPRC, a new facility under construction now and expected to be operational by 2030. Its flexibility makes it a perfect complement to the gaseous centrifuge isotope separators, or GCIS, the lab is developing for multiple isotopes. Self-sufficient GCIS, which also will be used in SIPRC, can produce high volumes of isotopes at a low cost. But changing GCIS from one isotope to another is a process that can take years, whereas EMIS can switch from producing one isotope to another in a matter of weeks.\"The EMIS fills a boutique, niche market: milligrams-to-grams scale at very high enrichments, with high flexibility where we can switch across the whole periodic table relatively rapidly,\" Egle said.Development of EMIS-3 went smoothly, Egle said, because of adequate funding\u2014including the renovation of a facility specifically for its production\u2014and because of the expertise and skilled workforce ORNL grew while developing the first two generations.\"We didn't just copy this out of a book,\" he said. \"This is knowledge that we've built and a knowledge base that can be taken to the next level, whatever the next level is.\"The lab also has established relationships with vendors to produce the ORNL-designed components for EMIS-3. Egle said parts for the technology come from as near as a small, family-owned electronics company in nearby Blount County, and as far away as an electromagnet facility in New Zealand. Vendors send fully integrated modules to ORNL to be assembled into the complete machine.\"The nice thing about EMIS-3 is that it's a very solid platform for further development,\" Egle said. \"It's extremely modular, and that gives the design a lot of flexibility. When you're looking at the whole periodic table, flexibility is very important. If we need to add additional safety engineering controls for different toxicities or hazards, that's easily done.\"Egle is excited about the potential for future generations of EMIS\u2014and for that matter, about ORNL's stable isotope program in general.\"The stable isotope program is absolutely fascinating; it enables so many different things,\" he said. \"You get to come to work and say, 'Do I want to work on curing cancer, basic science, national security\u2026?' You can pretty much touch it all during the course of a day in the stable isotope program. You can see that in our staff. People say, 'Wow, you guys are very excited about what you do.' It's easy to get excited about a mission space like that.\" Provided byOak Ridge National LaboratoryCitation:An electromagnetic isotope separator that continues to improve (2023, May 15)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-electromagnetic-isotope.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs) are a family of enigmatic proteins involved in cell growth and metabolism present in various species. From humans to fruit flies, they play a unique role in the growth of cancerous tumors and the spread of cancer throughout the body. New research emerging from McGill University is contributing to what is known about PRLs, which could potentially become an important tool in the development of cancer-fighting treatments.       Led by Kalle Gehring, a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and founding director of the McGill Centre for Structural Biology, the researchers focused on unraveling the mystery around PRLs. \"It's important for us to study PRLs because they are so important in cancer,\" said Gehring, \"In some cancers such as metastatic colorectal cancer, the proteins are overexpressed up to 300-fold.\"Published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Prof. Gehring and his colleagues (with data collected at the Canadian Light Source (CLS) at the University of Saskatchewan) confirmed that not only PRLs exist in all kinds of single- and multi-cell animals, but that the role of PRLs in binding magnesium transporters is common among all studied species.This overexpression of PRLs makes cancer cells more metastatic and drives the spread to other organs. This data could help to further the understanding of how these proteins influence human disease.\"What we learned is that they all bind the magnesium transporters in the same way,\" says Gehring. \"We're excited because it helps us understand this pathway, and that will reveal new targets for drugs to prevent cancer progression.\" More information:Rayan Fakih et al, Burst kinetics and CNNM binding are evolutionarily conserved properties of phosphatases of regenerating liver, Journal of Biological Chemistry (2023).

  "answer_race": " CDs can be used to stabilize drug supersaturation.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the enclosing cavity in a CD?",
  "answer_squad": " hydrophobic cavity",
  "text": "In the medicine market, most newly introduced drugs and drug candidates show poor water solubility, which prevents their absorption in the body. This, in turn, limits their therapeutic efficiency. Solubilizing agents such as cyclodextrins (CDs) are commonly employed to enhance their solubility.          CDs have a cyclic structure featuring a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic cavity inside that can enclose drug molecules to form inclusion complexes. However, solubilization does not necessarily enhance drug adsorption in the body, since the solubilized drugs cannot readily pass through biological membranes.One way to improve the permeability of drugs through biological membranes is by increasing their concentration in the solution to form a supersaturated state. However, supersaturated states are unstable as the drug tends to precipitate and form crystals, limiting its effectiveness.To prevent this, the addition of effective crystallization inhibitors is necessary to stabilize drug supersaturation over a long period. CD derivatives are particularly advantageous as they can solubilize drugs as well as inhibit their crystallization. However, the mechanism underlying their crystallization inhibition effect remains poorly understood.In this light, a study led by researchers from Chiba University, Japan, recently investigated the impact of 12 different CD derivatives with varying hydrophobic cavity sizes on crystallization inhibition of two poorly water-soluble drugs\u2014carvedilol (CVD) and chlorthalidone (CLT).Their work was published in the International Journal of Pharmaceutics. It involved contributions from Professor Kunikazu Moribe, Associate Professor Kenjirou Higashi, and Assistant Professor Keisuke Ueda.\"Different solubilization abilities of CD derivatives lead to different drug supersaturation levels, resulting in a misestimation of their crystallization inhibition strength. Thus, a systematic analysis of the drug crystallization inhibition effect while considering the solubilization effect of CD derivatives is essential,\" explains lead author Mengyao Liu, a Ph.D. student at the Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology at the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Chiba University.The researchers evaluated the solubilization and crystal inhibition effect of each CD derivative on the two drugs by performing phase solubility tests and measuring the crystallization induction time\u2014the time taken for a supersaturated solution to form crystals. In a phase solubility test, they dissolved the drugs in CD derivative solutions of different concentrations and examined their solubility.For measuring the crystallization induction time, the researchers added the drugs in drops to form supersaturated solutions and then analyzed their concentrations at different time intervals after removing the precipitated crystals.The phase solubility tests revealed that the addition of \u03b2-CD and \u03b3-CD derivatives improved the solubility of CVD. However, CLT's solubility was enhanced only by the \u03b2-CD derivative. \"Notably, the degree of solubility improvement depends on the ability to form stable inclusion complexes that, in turn, depends on the size fitness between the drug molecule and the CD cavity,\" explains Prof. Moribe.However, there was no correlation between the solubilization effect of the different CD derivations and their crystallization inhibition abilities. Moreover, methylated CD derivatives were more effective than their unmethylated counterparts in maintaining the supersaturated state. The researchers attributed the crystallization inhibition ability of the methylated CD derivatives to their highly hydrophobic outer surfaces, which sterically hinder the nucleation and crystal growth processes, and thus maintain the supersaturated state.\"We have discovered a novel function of methylated CD derivatives as effective stabilizers for supersaturated drugs, an effect that is independent of their inclusion complex formation ability,\" says Prof. Moribe.In conclusion, these findings shed light on the potential application of CD derivatives in drug-supersaturated formulations, which, in turn, could facilitate the clinical use of poorly water-soluble drug candidates.

  "answer_squad": " monomers",
  "text": "A program to advance the discovery of new polymers has been developed by a team of interdisciplinary researchers across King's Faculty of Natural, Mathematical and Engineering Sciences. The software, called PySoftK, uses AI to identify new polymer materials, which could be used across a wide range of applications including in medical technology, pharmaceuticals, energy storage and more. The software is described in a paper available on the chemRxiv pre-print server, and PySoftK is available on GitHub.          Professor Chris Lorenz from the Department of Physics and lead researcher on the technology said, \"PySoftK will allow us to accelerate the development of novel polymers for a whole range of applications, from using polymers with embedded nanoparticles to stitch human tissue together, to improving energy storage methods. These materials will help form a building block to tackle large scale challenges that we face in health care, in developing biodegradable home and personal care products and in creating more environmentally friendly energy storage systems.\"Polymers are large molecules made up of smaller repeating molecules called monomers, which bond together in a chain-like fashion to form a long polymer molecule. Polymers can be naturally occurring, such as proteins and DNA, or they can be synthetic, such as plastics and synthetic fibers. This new software development could change the way we investigate the relationship between the chemical structure and function of new polymeric materials, by providing a robust dataset for researchers to train artificial intelligence (AI) to identify desirable polymer properties.Synthetic polymers can be designed to interact with changes in their environment or make use of certain properties. For example, Gore-Tex, a polymer used in clothing was developed as an improvement to nylon, a traditional polymer. While both materials are waterproof, Gore-Tex is also be breathable, because it has been designed with a particular chemical property to perform a specific function. This is known as a designer polymer.Other areas where designer polymers are used, include medical ointments, paints, coatings, food packaging, biomedical imaging and energy storage. Designer polymers have the potential to have a wide range of different functions due to their underlying physical and chemical properties, which originate from the type and arrangement of monomers that build the polymer.To advance our discovery of these types of materials, high-performance computers (HPCs) are used to simulate and predict the behavior of polymers, which then informs researchers how best to build polymers with the desired properties for fulfilling certain tasks.      Over the past several decades, molecular scale simulations, computer simulations representing 3D structures of molecules, have improved our understanding of the relationship between chemical structure and function in increasingly complex polymers. However, more recent advances in computing power and computational algorithms have enabled scientists to investigate more complex systems and provide more accurate predictions using molecular-scale simulations at speed. This can lead to faster and more cost-effective design of materials, as less time is devoted to rounds of experimentation.Lorenz suggests, \"Normally, maintaining a large, diverse and accurate molecular database can be a hugely costly and time intensive process, as researchers race to label and categorize models correctly.\"By offering a set of tools and programming modules to automate the process of curating, modeling and creating libraries of polymers, PySoftK facilitates the generation of large databases on which to train future machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. This allows researchers to move their focus away from exhaustive library maintenance and onto discovering new materials.\"Dr. Alejandro Santana Bonilla, research software engineer within the Faculty of Natural, Mathematical and Engineering Sciences, and one of the lead researchers on the project said, \"The software package is versatile, flexible, and easy to install. It can generate a wide range of polymer topologies and perform library generation in a fully parallelized manner, making it highly efficient,\"Researchers hope that these models will be the driving force of new designer polymer development. PySoftK could also play a significant role for researchers in nano- and bio-technology, who are searching for new functional materials. But without reliable data to train the AI, they risk making inaccurate predictions.\"Ultimately, the integration of molecular scale simulations and machine learning into the rational design process for designer polymers will be vital to furthering our understanding between the chemical structure and function of complex materials,\" says Lorenz.

  "text": "Plants are impressive in their diversity, but especially in the variety of metabolites they produce. Many plant natural products are highly complex molecules, such as the alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, which are produced by the Madagascar periwinkle Catharanthus roseus. These two substances are already indispensable in cancer therapy.          Researchers are very interested in finding out which individual biosynthetic steps are required to form the complex molecules. \"Currently, these compounds are still obtained in very small quantities from the plant's leaf extract. We can learn from the plant how this compound is produced and use this knowledge to develop production systems that are more cost-effective, scalable and sustainable,\" said first author Chenxin Li of the University of Georgia's Center for Applied Genetic Technologies, describing the research goal. The study is published in the journal Nature Chemical Biology.Assigning genetic and metabolic information to individual cells of plant organsThe scientists know that gene activity is not the same in all cells of a plant and that the chemistry can differ drastically from cell to cell. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to use a new set of methods collectively termed single-cell omics to investigate specialized and rare cell types that play a central role in the biosynthesis of plant natural products, and whose signals are often obscured by more abundant cell types in plant organs.\"With single-cell omics, we have a method that allows researchers to assign genetic and metabolic information to individual cells. The term omics refers to the fact that an entire collection of genes or metabolites is quantified and analyzed,\" says Lorenzo Caputi, head of the Alkaloid Biosynthesis Project Group in the Department of Natural Product Biosynthesis in Jena and one of the lead authors.Biosynthetic pathway of vinblastine is organized in three distinct cell typesAs the analyses showed, the entire biosynthetic pathway for the alkaloid vinblastine is organized in three stages and three discrete cell types. \"The first stage is expressed exclusively in specialized cells associated with vascular bundles in the leaf, called IPAP. The second stage of the biosynthetic pathway is expressed only in cells of the epidermis, the layer of cells that cover the leaves, and the last known steps of the biosynthetic pathway are expressed exclusively in idioblasts, a rare cell type of the leaf,\" says Chenxin Li.      The researchers measured the concentrations of several intermediates in the metabolic pathway for vinblastine in single cells and were surprised. \"Two important precursors of vinblastine, catharanthine and vindoline, occur in the idioblast cells at millimolar concentrations, about three orders of magnitude higher than vinblastine itself. The concentration of the two precursors in these cells was much higher than we expected and even exceeded their concentrations in whole organ extracts. However, this observation makes sense in that catharanthine and vindoline were found only in the rare idioblast cells. The abundant other cells in the leaf dilute the high concentration when whole leaves are crushed,\" says Sarah O'Connor, head of the Department of Natural Product Biosynthesis.The research team is confident that the organization of biosynthetic pathways for medicinally relevant alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus is not an isolated phenomenon. \"We are just beginning to understand how and why such a cell type-specific organization exists. In addition, analysis of genes expressed simultaneously in a particular cell type has helped us identify new players in this metabolic pathway. The same technique can be used to study the biosynthesis of many other natural products.\"Finally, the exact sites of accumulation of plant compounds, such as the epidermis, the vascular system, or latex duct, can help us hypothesize the ecological roles of natural products. For example, depending on the pattern of accumulation, the compounds may be more effective against biting insects than they are against sap-sucking insects,\" says Robin Buell, Professor at Georgia University.A better understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of the anti-cancer drugs vincristine and vinblastine may also help to produce or harvest these compounds more effectively in the long term. The use of methods described is also promising for the study of many other interesting and medically important natural products from the plant kingdom. The approach described here will help to narrow down these rare and specialized cells and uncover the gene activities and chemistry that are exclusive to them.

  "text": "Researchers from Stockholm University have developed porous crystals made from pomegranate extract to capture and degrade pharmaceutical molecules found in local municipal wastewater. The research is published in the scientific journal Nature Water.          Pharmaceutical compounds affect the human body to improve our health, but they can also have unintentional adverse effects for the well-being of wildlife. Hence wastewater treatment plants are facing the challenge of removing emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) such as active pharmaceutical ingredients, and therefore new materials and technologies are required.One strategy for removing pollutants from water is by using porous materials that behave like sponges. Metal-organic frameworks, so called MOFs, are a type of nanoporous material that are made of metal ions and organic molecules. Most MOFs are made using synthetic organic molecules. But now researchers from the Department of Materials and Environmental Chemistry, Stockholm University, have managed to develop new porous MOFs using a naturally occurring molecule found in plants\u2014ellagic acid.\"Ellagic acid is one of the main building units of naturally occurring polyphenols known as tannins, which are common in fruits, berries, nuts, and tree bark. By combining ellagic acid, which was extracted from either pomegranate peel or tree bark, with zirconium ions, we developed a new highly porous MOF which we named SU-102,\" says Erik Svensson Grape, Ph.D. student at the Department of Materials and Environmental Chemistry.

Credit: Lisa Munthe             In order to test the performance of SU-102, water that had already been purified at a local wastewater treatment facility was further treated with the new MOF. The results showed that SU-102 removed many of the pharmaceutical pollutants that were not fully removed by the wastewater treatment facility. In addition to capturing the pharmaceutical pollutants, SU-102 was also used to break down pollutants using light in a process known as photodegradation.\"This has been a very exciting project as we got the opportunity to work directly with water samples from the treatment plant, thereby finding an application where our material could be put to use towards a very pressing environmental issue. We hope one day that SU-102 will be used on a bigger scale and also for other environmental applications,\" says Erik Svensson Grape at Stockholm University.

  "text": "Quick assessment of trace blood components in untreated blood samples is possible with fluorescence tests but, in practice, blood's strong autofluorescence interferes with the analysis. In the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition, a research team has now introduced a novel fluorescence probe that quenches this autofluorescence and precisely quantifies traces of hydrogen sulfide, which is an important signal molecule.          Some blood components are present in extremely low concentrations but are anything but unimportant. For example, the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide H2S, which smells of rotten eggs, is an important messenger molecule in the body. It is, among other things, involved in regulating circulation.Patients with cardiovascular diseases usually have a reduced H2S concentration in their blood, whereas patients with colon cancer often have elevated levels. The quantification of this and other trace components are correspondingly helpful in forming a diagnosis, and for the investigation of physiological and pathological relationships.Fluorescence tests are especially powerful in the analysis of biomolecules. They are inexpensive, uncomplicated, highly sensitive, and can be used for real-time measurements. The problem is that trace components cannot be detected in whole blood samples because blood itself strongly fluoresces, overwhelming weaker signals. Whole blood is therefore centrifuged and only the plasma is analyzed. However, this reduces the concentrations of unstable components and gas molecules, yielding inaccurate results.A team led by Hongwen Liu and Ronghua Yang at Hunan Normal University (Changsha, China) has now developed a novel technique for fluorescence tests that can successfully quantify H2S in whole blood. The trick is that the fluorescence probe itself almost completely quenches the interfering autofluorescence of the blood. The fluorescence dye very strongly absorbs the light that is given off by the autofluorescence of blood components.The fluorescence dye used is based on borodipyrromethene (BODIPY) that has been modified by the addition of two molecular fragments that \"recognize\" H2S. The presence of H2S activates the probe and it begins to fluoresce. Because the autofluorescence of the blood remains quenched, the background fluorescence remains very low and does not interfere.Fluorescence tests using the new probe on whole blood samples from patients with cardiovascular diseases verified their reduced H2S levels. Tests on mice with colon cancer showed, also as expected, elevated blood H2S concentrations.In addition, red blood cells from mice were treated with allicin. Allicin is the fragrant compound in garlic that is also responsible for its positive medicinal effects, such as reducing blood pressure. The team was able to use their new probe to demonstrate that allicin triggers the formation of H2S in red blood cells.The researchers hope to use this strategy to develop additional probes for other trace analytes in whole blood.

  "text": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major greenhouse gas emitted through various types of human activities. In an effort to decrease humanity's carbon footprint, scientists and policymakers across the globe are continuously trying to explore new methods for reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions and converting them into useful forms. In this regard, the electrochemical method of reducing CO2 to other carbonaceous forms like carbon monoxide, alcohols and hydrocarbon has gained considerable attention.          Against this backdrop, environmental researchers from Doshisha University, Japan led by Prof. Takuya Goto recently published a study in Electrochimica Acta that demonstrated one such method for converting CO2 into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) using molten salts through sustainable electrochemistry. Their study was made available online, and included contributions from Dr. Yuta Suzuki from the Harris Science Research Institute and Mr. Tsubasa Takeda from the Department of Science of Environment and Mathematical Modeling.Using a sustainable electrochemical technique, the research team facilitated the conversion of CO2 into MWCNT using LiCl-KCl melt. The molten salts were saturated with CO2 gas and semi-immersed nickel (Ni) substrate was used as electrode. The supplied CO2 was electrochemically converted to solid carbon at the end of the procedure. This green conversion occurred via a reduction reaction at the Ni electrode/LiCl-KCl melt/CO2 interface.\"The electrochemical reduction of CO2 on a Ni electrode in LiCl-KCl melt at 723K was studied. Under high polarization, a super meniscus was formed at the three-phase interface of the Ni electrode/LiCl-KCl melt/CO2 gas, where the direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 to solid carbon progressed. Solid carbon was obtained in the wetted area of the Ni electrode as well as in the bulk molten salt via the electrochemical technique,\" says Prof. Goto.Subsequent characterization of the electrode-deposited carbon using electron microscopy techniques and elemental analysis revealed that the obtained carbonaceous material consisted of MWCNTs, commercially viable nanostructures, that were 30\u201350 nm in diameter. The team then varied the applied voltage and extended the reaction time, recording noticeable changes in the MWCNTs. The height of the generated MWCNTs increased after the electrolysis time was increased from 10 min to 180 min.\"We studied the dependence of applied potential and electrolytic time on the morphology and crystallinity of the electrodeposited carbon. Based on our experimental results, we proposed a model for the formation of the MWCNTs on the Ni electrode,\" says Prof. Goto.The proposed model for the generation of MWCNTs from CO2 is described in three stages. The first stage involves the reduction of CO2 to carbon atoms at the Ni/LiCl-KCl melt/CO2 interface. During the second stage, the electrodeposited carbon atoms form Ni-C compounds (like NiC) on the surface of Ni electrode. Finally, when solubility limit of carbon in Ni-C compounds is reached, the cylindrical-shaped MWCNTs grow from the edge of the Ni-C compounds generated during the second stage.In summary, the study identifies a novel process for sustainably converting CO2 into commercially useful carbonaceous materials. Moreover, the employed electrochemical process is environment friendly owing to the non-usage of fossil fuel. In addition, the use of high-temperature molten salts is unique because it enables the direct conversion of CO2 gas into MWCNTs.\"Our results indicate that CO2 can be converted into carbonaceous functional materials. By combining non-consumable oxygen-evolving anodes, this technique can contribute to the development of a carbon recycling technology that will not only solve global environmental problems but also play an important in carbon pricing economies. The material production process, which does not use fossil fuels, will help realize a sustainable society in the near future,\" says Prof. Goto.

  "text": "Synthetic organic polymers are typically insoluble polycrystalline or amorphous products rather than single crystals. The direct synthesis of single-crystal porous polymers remains a challenge in polymer science and crystal engineering.          However, many biomacromolecules found in nature can achieve single-crystal form assisted with multiple supramolecular interactions, implying that reversible supramolecular interactions can be used to modulate the crystallinity of porous polymer materials.In a study published in Nature Synthesis, the research groups led by Prof. Liu Tianfu and Prof. Cao Rong from Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter of the Chinese Academy of Sciences proposed a strategy to achieve single crystals of a porous polymer.In the hierarchical structures of natural protein crystals and some nucleic acids, 1D covalent chains generate highly crystalline or even single-crystal products through a synergistic combination of non-covalent supramolecular interactions, and further fold into specific spatial conformations as secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. Inspired by this, the researchers envisioned that the judicious choice of 1D chains with tunable dynamic covalent bonds and supramolecular interactions might yield direct synthesis of a single-crystal porous polymer with desired cavities, ion channels and functionalities.They designed and synthesized a single-crystal porous polymer-based hydrogen-bonded organic framework (PHOF-1) through a one-pot route and confirmed its structure by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies.The researchers found that 1,4-phenylenebisboronic acid monomers polymerize into a tetramer to afford a nine-membered B4O52- cluster (primary structure), which further extends into 1D covalent chains (secondary structure) that are non\u2013covalently cross-linked by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions (tertiary structure), ultimately evolving to afford a hydrogen-bonded organic framework (quaternary structure).Compared with insoluble 2D or 3D crosslinked porous polymers, the 1D polymer chains show excellent solubility and solution processability. The dissolved PHOF-1 maintains the consecutive 1D chain structure with a very narrow molecular weight distribution and can regenerate reversibly in single-crystal or amorphous states depending on the solvent evaporation rate.Taking advantage of the solution processibility, the researchers continuously coated PHOF-1 onto a non-woven fabric to afford a functional composite textile capable of capturing NH3.This design strategy may open a new avenue for the exploration of single-crystal porous polymer materials with precise structural information, confined pore spaces, and straightforward solution processibility.

  "text": "During his Ph.D. with TUoS, ISIS facility development student Innes McClelland developed a cell for testing battery materials during their operation using muon spectroscopy and used it to study an increasingly vital cathode material.          Understanding what is happening inside a battery material while it is charging and discharging is crucial to improving the performance of existing batteries and developing new materials for use in the batteries of the future.One cathode material that is proving increasingly vital for future batteries is LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2, known as NMC811. This material has a high capacity, but often suffers an irreversible capacity loss between the first charge and discharge. It's thought that this loss of capacity may be due to kinetic barriers to diffusion of the lithium ions in the material. Understanding this issue could lead to insights that inform the design of new and improved alternatives.Muon spectroscopy is an excellent tool for studying these materials because it can probe the diffusion of ions such as lithium and sodium on a local scale, largely avoiding interfacial or grain boundary effects. Previous muon experiments on battery materials have studied the components individually, outside a battery. Although these are useful for understanding the fundamental properties, they lack an insight into the behavior of the materials during operation.Professor Serena Cussen, who co-supervised Innes through his PhD, spoke as part of an ISIS-organized session at the AAAS conference in March. In this video, she gives an overview of the work of her research group, and how they use neutrons and muons to learn more about materials of interest for clean energy storage research. Credit: University of SheffieldAs part of his ISIS facility development studentship, Dr. Innes McClelland designed a cell that would be able to do just that. Working in collaboration with his co-supervisor beamline scientist Peter Baker and engineers from ISIS, his supervisor Professor Serena Cussen at the University of Sheffield and colleagues from the Faraday Institution next-generation cathode project FutureCat, he was able to design a cell for doing operando muon spectroscopy measurements.As explained in their recent paper, published in Chemistry of Materials, the group were able to use this cell to study NMC811 to investigate what might be causing its lack of repeat cyclability. Using the new setup, they could measure the lithium diffusion characteristics within the material at over 70 points during the first cycle. They found that the lithium diffusion was, as expected, faster at a higher state of charge, but that it never restored to the same value as in the pristine sample.Interestingly, by combining the differing measurement properties of muon spectroscopy with electrochemical methods, they were able to see that this slow diffusion was more prevalent on the surface of the cathode, rather than in the bulk material. This suggests that processes that focus on stabilizing the surface of the material are likely to be more successful at improving its properties.\"The exciting development of operando muon spectroscopy opens up a wide range of opportunities for researchers working on energy storage materials, allowing a unique perspective of ionic diffusion from inside the materials themselves whilst in operation,\" Innes explains.He adds, \"I look forward to seeing future studies which can develop the field towards a variety of battery chemistries.\" More information:Innes McClelland et al, Direct Observation of Dynamic Lithium Diffusion Behavior in Nickel-Rich, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) Cathodes Using Operando Muon Spectroscopy, Chemistry of Materials (2023).

  "text": "The rigidity, transparency and hardness of PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) make it one of the most valuable plastics for the manufacture of plastic bottles, packaging and other single-use products. However, these characteristics make it highly persistent in the environment, to the point that a plastic PET bottle may take several hundred years to degrade in the ocean.          At the molecular level, PET, and all plastics, have a polymeric structure made up of tens of thousands of repetitions of small subunits called monomers. In the last decades, the degradation of PET by a kind of bacterial enzymes called polyester hydrolases (or PETases) has been regarded with much hope, as it is considered as a potential eco-friendly method for recycling plastic waste and recover the original monomers, thus enabling an effective circular-material economy loop.Now, a new study led by the Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies del Mar (ICM-CSIC) and the University of Leipzig (Germany) has revealed the details, at the molecular level, of the PET degradation process by these enzymes.\"The results of our work can be very useful for the industry, as this is the first time we can 'see' the motion picture of the process. Also, they pave the way to design new enzymes capable of breaking down the plastic into its original soluble components with high efficiency,\" explains Francesco Colizzi, a leading author of the study.From her side, Ania Di Pede-Mattatelli, one of the work co-authors, adds that \"these enzymes could also be applied to treat PET microplastics from washing of microfleece textiles that end up in sewage treatment plants, thus contributing to the preservation of the marine environment.\"Experiments and 3D simulationsTo unravel the inherent mechanism of biocatalytic degradation of PET at the atomic level, the authors of the work, recently published in the journal ACS Catalysis, designed a glass matrix that stabilized the enzymatic reaction intermediates and allowed their detection in real time by specific experiments of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Then, using molecular calculations on a supercomputer, they were able to interpret the spectroscopic data and generate a detailed 3D molecular model of the enzymatic process of PET degradation.Until now, how PET could bind and interact with these enzymes have been the subject of intense research, and controversial hypotheses have been put forward. For example, the simultaneous binding of a large portion of PET to the enzyme was thought to be necessary for the enzyme to break down the plastic polymer into its original components.Instead, this work shows that the interaction of only 2 PET subunits is enough for the enzyme to cut the polymer. Lastly, the study reveals that the enzyme can \"walk\" or slide on the PET chain to move from one cut to the other.\"Understanding how PET interacts with the enzyme is important to guide the design of new improved systems for recycling. In the end, nature itself provides us with the starting material to reduce plastic pollution, but we must use them appropriately,\" concludes Colizzi.

  "text": "New synthetic metabolic pathways for fixation of carbon dioxide could not only help to reduce the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, but also replace conventional chemical manufacturing processes for pharmaceuticals and active ingredients with carbon-neutral, biological processes. A new study published in Nature Communications demonstrates a process that can turn carbon dioxide into a valuable material for the biochemical industry via formic acid.          In view of rising greenhouse gas emissions, carbon capture, the sequestration of carbon dioxide from large emission sources, is an urgent issue. In nature, carbon dioxide assimilation has been taking place for millions of years, but its capacity is far from sufficient to compensate man-made emissions.Researchers led by Tobias Erb at the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology are using nature's toolbox to develop new ways of carbon dioxide fixation. They have now succeeded in developing an artificial metabolic pathway that produces the highly reactive formaldehyde from formic acid, a possible intermediate product of artificial photosynthesis. Formaldehyde could be fed directly into several metabolic pathways to form other valuable substances without any toxic effects. As in the natural process, two primary components are required: Energy and carbon. The former can be provided not only by direct sunlight but also by electricity\u2014for example from solar modules.Formic acid is a C1 building blockWithin the added-value chain, the carbon source is variable. carbon dioxide is not the only option here, all monocarbons (C1 building blocks) come into question: carbon monoxide, formic acid, formaldehyde, methanol and methane. However, almost all of these substances are highly toxic\u2014either to living organisms (carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol) or to the planet (methane as a greenhouse gas). Only formic acid, when neutralized to its base formate, is tolerated by many microorganisms in high concentrations.\"Formic acid is a very promising carbon source,\" says Maren Nattermann, first author of the study. \"But converting it to formaldehyde in the test tube is quite energy-intensive.\" This is because the salt of formic acid, formate, cannot be converted easily into formaldehyde. \"There's a serious chemical barrier between the two molecules that we have to bridge with biochemical energy\u2014ATP\u2014before we can perform the actual reaction.\"The researcher's goal was to find a more economical way. After all, the less energy it takes to feed carbon into metabolism, the more energy remains to drive growth or production. But such a path does not exist in nature. \"It takes some creativity to discover so-called promiscuous enzymes with multiple functions,\" says Tobias Erb. \"However, the discovery of candidate enzymes is only the beginning. We're talking about reactions that you can count along with since they're so slow\u2014in some cases, less than one reaction per second per enzyme. Natural reactions can happen a thousand times faster.\"This is where synthetic biochemistry comes in, says Maren Nattermann. \"If you know an enzyme's structure and mechanism, you know where to intervene. Here, we benefit significantly from the preliminary work of our colleagues in basic research.\"      High-throughput technology speeds up enzyme optimizationThe optimization of the enzymes included several approaches: building blocks were specifically exchanged, and random mutations were generated and selected for capability. \"Formate and formaldehyde are both wonderfully suited because they penetrate cell walls. We can put formate into the culture medium of cells that produce our enzymes, and after a few hours convert the formaldehyde produced into a non-toxic yellow dye,\" explains Maren Nattermann.The result would not have been possible in such a short time without the use of high-throughput methods. To achieve this, the researchers cooperated with their industrial partner Festo, based in Esslingen, Germany. \"After about 4,000 variants, we achieved a fourfold improvement in production,\" says Maren Nattermann. \"We have thus created the basis for the model mikrobe Escherichia coli, the microbial workhorse of biotechnology, to grow on formic acid. For now, however, our cells can only produce formaldehyde, not convert it further.\"With collaboration partner Sebastian Wenk at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, the researchers are currently developing a strain that can take up the intermediates and introduce them into the central metabolism. In parallel, the team is conducting research with a working group at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion headed by Walter Leitner on the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to formic acid. The long-term goal is an \"all-in-one platform\"\u2014from carbon dioxide via an electrobiochemical process to products like insulin or biodiesel.

  "text": "Plastic is cheap and light, and conceivably recyclable, which makes it an easy choice for packaging when it comes to food and cosmetics. But it's also potentially toxic and biologically harmful, making it a non-starter for many environmentally responsible and socially conscious companies in Canada and around the world.          Western chemistry professor Elizabeth Gillies, mechanical and materials engineering professor Aaron Price and their research teams worked with industry partner CTK Bio Canada to develop a new biodegradable, hemp-based material that could serve as a sustainable substitute for packaging needs for a wide variety of products.\"When it comes to packaging, plastic replaces things like metal and glass. Those are heavy and expensive,\" said Gillies, who is also the Canada Research Chair in polymeric biomaterials. \"Glass recycling is not a very profitable business and while many plastics are potentially recyclable, it often doesn't happen in practice.\"This lack of recycling, compounded by a global microplastics pollution crisis, led Gillies and her team to find a degradable 'plastic' to solve the problem, or in this case, a hemp-based product.Hemp is a sustainable agricultural crop that requires minimal resources to grow. It's also a waste product of Canada's ever-growing cannabis industry, making it a free resource that would otherwise be destined for a compost heap or the landfill. These reasons alone make hemp a suitable candidate, but its structural makeup makes it a clear winner.\"Depending on the form, hemp can have a fibrous structure, which acts perfectly as a reinforcement for materials,\" said Gillies. \"Basically, hemp is stronger and more malleable than many other biomaterials.\"The goal of the project with CTK Bio was to find a proxy for widely used industrial plastics such as high-density polyethylene pellets, which could be fed directly into the same manufacturing process currently used to produce plastic packaging. Gillies and her collaborators used ground hemp stalk powder to serve as filler during production of packaging.While mechanical properties like strength and malleability are not quite the same as the current packaging plastics, the new biomaterial approaches the necessary qualities, depending on the application, and they do exhibit degradability, which is key.In terms of cost, biomaterials are currently more expensive to produce than plastic, but companies are working to optimize and reduce pricing, so it is expected costs will fall in the coming years as these technologies improve.Results of the study validate the new hemp-based biomaterial's potential as a plastic alternative and open the door for future industry collaborations and partnerships.

  "text": "An international research team led by Bert Weckhuysen (Utrecht University) and Sara Bals (University of Antwerp) has shown that a promising catalyst for clearing CO2 becomes significantly more active and selective if its pretreatment is modified. The scientists have visualized the mechanism underlying this concept with unparalleled precision. The results of the study are published in Science on May 11. Matteo Monai, Kellie Jenkinson and Angela Melcherts are the first authors.          Cleaning up carbon dioxide or converting it into something useful is becoming increasingly common, for example in the energy and transportation sectors, where huge amounts of the greenhouse gas are emitted. Catalysts are necessary for such a cleanup process to proceed properly and quickly. In the case of CO2 hydrogenation, which is a widely used chemical reaction to clean up CO2, a nickel-supported titanium dioxide catalyst is used.In this study, the scientists show that the catalyst's performance is highly dependent on the temperature at which it is prepared. The selectivity and activity of the catalyst were much better during CO2 hydrogenation at a pretreatment temperature of 600\u00b0C than at 400\u00b0C. Better selectivity is desirable because the catalyst provides fewer unwanted by-products. Improved activity results in a faster progression of the catalytic reaction. The researchers expect the same principle to apply to catalysts with metal oxides other than titanium oxide.The team of scientists made the principle visible using advanced electron microscopy. And they did so with unparalleled precision: at the atomic level. They inserted a special nanoreactor, in which the catalytic process took place, into the microscope and were able to see exactly what happened to the catalyst.\"During the process, you see the titanium atoms crawling onto the nickel like layers and coming off again,\" Bert Weckhuysen says. \"At a high pretreatment temperature, some titanium atoms remained on the nickel. At a low temperature, the layers of titanium atoms disappeared completely.\"Two chemical elements, such as nickel and titanium, interacting and forming a catalyst, is an old concept known as strong metal support interaction (SMSI). This study reveals for the first time what happens at the atomic level during this interaction. The sliding layers of titanium have never been seen before. \"The new technique has made it possible for us to observe this with our own eyes,\" says Weckhuysen. \"With, moreover, a very high resolution. We can count the titanium atoms on the nickel.\"The international research team that worked on the study is extremely interdisciplinary. According to Sara Bals, this was critical to achieving the results obtained. \"We used electron microscopy techniques that are generally difficult to combine with experiments in a nanoreactor,\" she says. \"Researchers with different backgrounds and access to a variety of advanced techniques each laid out small pieces of a larger puzzle. Ultimately, these pieces combined led to the complete picture.\" More information:Matteo Monai et al, Restructuring of titanium oxide overlayers over nickel nanoparticles during catalysis, Science (2023).

  "text": "Scripps Research chemists have solved a long-standing problem in the field of pharmaceutical chemistry with a relatively simple and controllable method for making benzocyclobutenes (BCBs)\u2014a class of reactive compounds that are highly valued as building blocks for drug molecules, but have been relatively hard to access.          The new method, described in a paper in Science, uses designer ligand molecules with palladium-atom catalysts to break pairs of adjacent methylene-type C-H bonds in relatively cheap and abundant carboxylic acids. Breaking these bonds enables the making of BCBs with unprecedented ease through a process called a formal [2+2] cycloaddition.The researchers demonstrated the new method with relatively easy syntheses of several BCBs found in traditional medicines and in experimental and approved drug molecules. The paper, \"Regio-controllable [2+2] benzannulation with two adjacent C(sp3)\u2013H bonds,\" was co-authored by Ji-Min Yang, Yu-Kun Lin, Tao Sheng, Liang Hu, Xin-Pei Cai and Jin-Quan Yu, all of Scripps Research.\"Our new method requires only a saturated aliphatic chain and aryl halides as coupling partners for a formal cycloaddition yielding a four-membered ring,\" says study senior author Jin-Quan Yu, Ph.D., the Bristol Myers Squibb Endowed Chair in Chemistry and Frank and Bertha Hupp Professor in the Department of Chemistry at Scripps Research. \"By contrast, the traditional method for making BCBs requires more steps and yields a mix of products that are hard to separate.\"BCBs have a unique core structure consisting of a relatively rigid, strained and reactive ring of four carbon atoms fused to a benzene ring. They are present in some natural medicinal compounds and in the heart-failure drug ivabradine. In general, their propensity for biological activity makes them potentially very useful building blocks for drugs. They are also key ingredients in photosensitive polymers, polymer dielectrics and other advanced materials.The synthesis of BCBs has been challenging, however. The limitations of the various methods that have been published include an inability to control the order in which individual reactions occur, so that the reaction products include not only the desired product but also unwanted ones. Yu's new method for the first time enables this control\u2014a property called regioselectivity.Last year, the Yu lab developed a method for the palladium-catalyzed, \u03b2- and \u03b3-methylene C-H functionalization of free aliphatic acids, to make structurally diverse \u03b3- and \u03b4-lactones\u2014also highly valued as potential pharmaceutical building blocks. Inspired by that method and using it as a starting point, they pursued a similar approach to surmount the challenge of BCB regioselective synthesis.For the new method, they employed bidentate amide-pyridone ligands bearing palladium catalysts to activate the C-H bonds of two adjacent methylene units in a carboxylic acid.\"In the presence of a dihaloheteroarene, two C\u2013H bonds and two aryl\u2013halogen bonds are stitched together almost miraculously to form a bicyclic BCB scaffold,\" Yu says. \"Regioselectivity is achieved through the differentiation between the aryl iodide and bromide sites.\"The chemists showed that the method can be used with a wide range of cyclic and acyclic aliphatic acids to generate diverse BCBs and hetero-BCBs\u2014a dream come true for many pharmaceutical chemists.\"The ability to make direct use of abundant and structurally varied acyclic and cyclic acids as substrates, without pre-functionalization, substantially expands chemists' access to diverse BCB scaffolds\u2014including heterocyclic BCBs that can be very useful in drug molecules,\" Yu says.

  "text": "Smashed on toast, creamed in guacamole or blended into salad dressing, avocados always seem to be popular. However, the fruits are notoriously finicky, going from pale green and firm to brown and mushy in the blink of an eye. Now, researchers in ACS Food Science & Technology report a chitosan-based coating that preserves them for longer periods. The team also developed an imaging technique to quickly predict their shelf life.          To tell if avocados are ripe, most people gently squeeze them, and a little sponginess indicates that they're mature. Producers conduct similar assessments to determine which avocados can withstand transportation to grocery stores. Despite these tests, some of them spoil prematurely.Therefore, researchers have developed techniques to delay ripening, using compounds such as 1-methyl-cyclopropene (1-MCP). And more recently, studies have shown that naturally-derived chitosan\u2014a biomaterial derived from shellfish exoskeletons\u2014imparts antimicrobial activity when applied as a coating to fruits, including avocados. So, Angie Homez-Jara, Angelica Sandoval-Aldana and colleagues wanted to compare the effectiveness of the two preservation methods on avocados' quality and shelf life.The researchers treated commercially mature Hass avocados with either gaseous 1-MCP or water-based solutions that contained different concentrations of chitosan. Mimicking realistic transportation conditions, treated and untreated avocados were chilled at 41 degrees Fahrenheit for 21 days and then moved to room temperature to simulate a grocery store environment, until they were rotten.Untreated samples and those treated with either 1-MCP or 1% chitosan-based coating were at optimal ripeness for 6 days. Fruits treated with a 1.5% chitosan-based coating were best for 12 days. However, these samples also had uneven firmness once they were ripe, as well as green and purplish spots in the peel, which the researchers say shows that the chitosan coating could be improved in the future.Throughout the study, the researchers also imaged the entire surface of the fruits with hyperspectral cameras in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. Then the reflectance data from the images were compared to the avocados' firmness, peel color, oxygen consumption and weight loss, using a number of computer models.Two machine learning models best explained the changes that occurred during the avocados' ripening and could predict their remaining shelf life. The researchers say that their chitosan-based coating and prediction technique could help improve the shelf life and quality of avocados for sale.

  "answer_squad": " Lanthanides",
  "text": "Bacteria that feed on methanol are able to grow on certain rare earth elements as well as their radioactive relatives. These findings suggest a possible role for such bacteria in the decontamination of areas where actinides are spilled, or in the separation of lanthanides and actinides for analytical or preparative purposes, according to a study published in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition.          Lanthanides belong to the rare earth elements widely used in electronics and energy technologies. With one exception, they are not radioactive, they are abundant in the Earth's crust, and some lanthanides such as lanthanum and neodymium even play a crucial role in bacterial metabolism. Actinides, which include uranium and plutonium, are their heavy, radioactive counterparts, most of which are not found naturally on Earth. Now, Lena Daumann from Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Germany, and her international interdisciplinary team have discovered that some actinides can replace essential lanthanides in the metabolism of methylotrophic bacteria.Methylotrophic bacteria, so-called as they use methanol as their energy source, contain lanthanides in their methanol-oxidizing enzyme. The researchers observed that these bacteria could also take up actinide ions into this enzyme, using them for methanol metabolism in the same way as they would use lanthanides. This observation was particularly valid when the actinide ions were the same size and had the same stable +III oxidation states as the corresponding lanthanides. The bacteria even preferred americium and curium as actinides over some lanthanides when presented with a mixture of lanthanides and actinides, the researchers reported.Americium and curium showed a stable +III oxidation state, which appeared to be particularly important. \"When we used plutonium, which is known to have higher oxidation states, our bacteria did not grow, nor did the isolated enzymes work with it either,\" Daumann says. This knowledge will be useful for future applications. The team plans to explore the ability of the bacteria to extract actinides from radioactive waste or to separate out specific elements from mixtures.Actinides such as plutonium, americium, and curium can be generated in nuclear reactors and are used in research, the nuclear industry, and many other technologies. Americium is even a source of ionizing radiation in commercial smoke detectors. However, actinides are highly radioactive and hazardous elements, which have to be handled with great care at special facilities. Spillages of radioactive substances are always of great concern. Dauman proposes \"putting these bacteria to use to help clean up radioactive spills,\" as a possible future application.

  "answer_squad": " methane",
  "text": "Extensive research has been conducted on the oxidation of methane to obtain methanol for the production of useful compounds, such as formaldehyde, dimethyl ether, etc. However, methane is the most difficult hydrocarbon to be oxidized, and to date, to the best of our knowledge, no method has been developed to efficiently and selectively convert methane to methanol under mild conditions.       Inspired by the structure and reaction mechanism of naturally occurring metalloenzymes that oxidize methane, researchers have developed a mononuclear iron complex with a hydrophobic environment near the active iron center. Using this iron complex as a catalyst and a cheap and safe oxidant, they have accomplished the direct conversion of methane to methanol with high efficiency and selectivity.In this reaction, the oxidation of methane proceeds under mild conditions of 50 \u00b0C temperature and ~10 atm pressure in an aqueous solution. The catalytic turnover number exceeds 500 in 3 h and methanol can be produced with a high selectivity of 83%.The achievement of such high efficiency and selectivity is owing to the presence of a hydrophobic environment near the iron center, i.e., the active site of the catalyst. The hydrophobic cavity traps methane (hydrophobic substance) and releases the generated methanol (hydrophilic substance) into the aqueous solution while preventing the excessive oxidation of methanol by suppressing its approach to the active iron center.Such a \"catch-and-release\" mechanism is expected to be an effective model that can be applied to the conversion of methane to methanol as well as to the efficient chemical conversion of various hydrophobic organic compounds.The study is published in the journal Nature.

  "text": "A common chemical reaction that most people have seen first-hand is the inspiration for a new way to make a flexible gel film that could lead to innovations in sensors, batteries, robotics and more.          A research team led by Texas Engineers developed what they call a \"dip-and-peel\" strategy for simple and rapid fabrication of two-dimensional ionogel membranes. By dipping sustainable biomass materials in certain solvents, molecules naturally respond by arranging themselves into functional thin films at the edge of the material that can easily be removed using nothing more than a simple set of tweezers.This strategy, the researchers said, was inspired by what happens to milk at elevated temperatures\u2014a reaction we often observe in daily life.\"In the milk-skin effect, a film forms at the outer layer of milk when it is heated,\" said Guihua Yu, a professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering's Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering and Texas Materials Institute, who focuses on materials science. \"We were inspired by this phenomena and explored it in different materials to produce multifunctional gel membranes that are easy to separate.\"The research was published in Nature Synthesis.                Credit: The University of Texas at Austin/Cockrell School of Engineering             These gels are made up of a polymer network surrounded by ionic liquid. They are similar to hydrogels in structure, where water is the liquid element. But, ionogels feature a less rigid structure, giving ions more room to move around.Because of this, they are highly conductive and very sensitive. They have high potential as sensors, possibly as part of wearable electronics that could more accurately track motion, heartbeat and other aspects of health monitoring. They could even serve as the electrolyte in solid-state batteries, a part of the safer battery that shuttles ions back and forth to facilitate charging and discharging.The major innovation in the research is in the novel fabrication process, and it works on many different materials. The process can be reproduced hundreds or thousands of times at high speed and low cost. And the films can be easily manipulated to be as thick or thin as needed and shaped or coated to other materials.\"This simple yet effective solvent-induced self-assembly method really allows rapid, and scalable production of 2D functional polymer films from different sustainable biomass materials, including cellulose, chitosan, silk fibroin, guar gum and more,\" said Nancy (Youhong) Guo, one of the lead authors on the paper, a former graduate student in Yu's lab and now a postdoctoral researcher at MIT.Yu said he hopes other researchers will pick up this technique and run with it for various technologies. Going forward, the research team will work to further optimize the mechanical properties for more applications and advanced functionalities for next-generation technologies such as wearable electronics, smart robotics and artificial intelligence.This research also involves other collaborators from Northeast Forestry University and Shenyang University of Chemical Technology in China.

  "text": "Much of what is now considered modern medicine originated as folk remedies or traditional, Indigenous practices. These customs are still alive today, and they could help address a variety of conditions. Now reporting in ACS Omega, a team of researchers have identified compounds in the leaves of a particular medicinal Labrador tea plant used throughout the First Nations of Nunavik, Canada, and demonstrated that one of them has activity against the parasite responsible for malaria.          \"Labrador tea\" refers to multiple, closely related plants\u2014all members of the genus Rhododendron. These are small, evergreen shrubs with fuzzy leaves that, as their name suggests, are steeped to make herbal teas commonly used by the Inuit and Indigenous nations in the U.S. and Canada. Reportedly, drinks made from the leaves or roots can aid in treating colds or the flu, headaches or stomach aches, nasal congestion and many other ailments.Past studies have shown that essential oils extracted from the plants have antimicrobial properties, which could help fight antibiotic-resistant microbes. Dwarf Labrador tea, or Rhododendron subarcticum, produces a particularly aromatic brew and grows in the harsher conditions of the subarctic, found from Alaska to Siberia just south of the Arctic Circle.Despite its common use as a traditional medicine, its chemical composition and potential antimicrobial applications remain relatively unstudied. So, Normand Voyer and colleagues wanted to characterize the makeup of R. subarcticum for the first time and test its antiparasitic activity.The team gathered R. subarcticum leaves from Nunavik, a region in northern Quebec. The researchers extracted the essential oil from the leaves and analyzed it with gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and flame ionization detection, to identify 53 compounds. It turns out that 64.7% of the oil was comprised of ascaridole, followed by p-cymene at 21.1%. This combination of compounds has not previously been reported in closely related North American Labrador tea varieties, though it has been found in subspecies originating in Europe and Asia.To see whether this essential oil had antimalarial properties, the team exposed two strains of Plasmodium falciparum, a malaria-causing parasite, to the oil or to just ascaridole. In the experiment, one of the strains was resistant to known antimalaria drugs. The data showed that ascaridole was the primarily component that acted against both strains of the parasite, which is consistent with other, antiparasitic traditional medicines also rich in the compound.The researchers say that this work bolsters the importance of investigating and protecting plants used in traditional medicines, especially those from harsher climates impacted by climate change.

A team of scientists at Tohoku University have recently found a potential environment for the reaction that produced catalytic organic polymers. To do so, they dried amino acid solutions containing boric acid and found that boric acid catalyzes polypeptide synthesis under neutral and acidic conditions. The longest peptides formed in the experiments were 39 monomer-long glycine polypeptides under a neutral condition.Details of their research were published in the journal Communications Chemistry on May 11, 2023.Previous studies have suggested that highly alkaline evaporative environments served as the place for ancient protein synthesis, yielding up to 20 monomer-long glycine peptides. Neutral conditions were thought to be the worst-case in regards to peptide synthesis.Boron-containing minerals have been discovered abundantly in some of the oldest sedimentary-origin rocks found on Earth, dating back 3.8 billion years. These findings suggest that coastal areas of ancient small continents and islands rich in boric acid spontaneously assembled amino acids, forming polypeptides and proto-proteins.\"The formation of polypeptides in neutral environments have important meanings in the chemical evolution of the origin of life,\" says lead author Yoshihiro Furukawa, an associate professor at Tohoku University.While RNAs are rather stable under neutral conditions, they are extremely unstable under alkaline conditions. Boron has been known to help many steps in abiotic ribonucleotide synthesis.\"Boron-rich neutral evaporative environments serve as an ideal place for the formations and interactions between the two essential polymers on prebiotic Earth,\" Furukawa says.This research group is now investigating which amino acids are incorporated in the proto-peptides in this environment.

  "text": "Spring means snowstorms for much of the country, which can bring inches of heavy, wet snow. Tree branches sag, and a few snap\u2014but most bounce back quickly with the warming spring sun.          Plant cells contain high amounts of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, which are the primary building blocks of plant stems and trunks. Much less is known, however, about a crucial fourth polymer: pectin, thought to provide strength and flexibility by interconnecting with the other three components.What has particularly puzzled scientists is exactly how plants build the pectin components of the cell wall.Now, researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the University of Georgia, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have discovered the biological mechanism involved in making one specific component of pectin. Published in Nature Plants, the article details the structure and biochemical activity of the enzyme Galactan Synthase 1 (GalS1), an enzyme involved in turning the sugar galactose into its polymeric form, called galactan\u2014an important pectin component.\"If you ask most people in the biofuels industry about the major components of plant cell walls, they will tell you cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin,\" said Yannick Bomble, an NREL biophysicist. \"Pectin is often overlooked unless you talk to a plant scientist, but it's a very essential component of any plant.\"The study complements the team's other recent work that details different processes in plant biopolymer synthesis. Together, they provide a picture on how plant enzymes work together to build complex polymers\u2014polymers that scientists might someday modify to more easily extract useful cell wall components from biomass or manufacture sustainable bioproducts.GalS1 decorates pectin with sidechains of arabinose and galactose sugarsTo create flexible limbs, deep roots, and sturdy trunks, plant enzymes work in tandem to reconfigure raw resources like sugars into polymers they can later use as building materials for their cell walls. Among the many enzymes involved in these processes, GalS1 performs a specific role: It links galactose sugar molecules together onto a long pectin chain at specific locations, almost like fastening tree branches to a central trunk.The result is a structurally complex molecular component of pectin. According to Vivek Bharadwaj, an NREL computational scientist, researchers have struggled to understand plant enzymes, such as GalS1, involved in making polymers like pectin.\"We wanted to understand, at the atomistic level, how the substrates bind at the active site and the mechanisms by which the sugar gets attached to increase the chain length of the galactan branch,\" he said. \"That's really traditionally been tough to do experimentally, which is where NREL came in.\"Using computational tools, Bharadwaj and Bomble provided an unprecedentedly detailed look at both the structure of the enzyme and its biochemistry. That effort revealed specifics on how and where the substrates bind, as well as what biological machinery GalS1 uses to complete such specific biochemical tasks.They found that GalS1 is unique, containing a special module that lets it bind to a pectin backbone laid down by other enzymes. Once attached, GalS1 positions its catalytic domain to start stacking sugars, one on top of another. The resulting branches\u2014comprised of galactan chains that are terminated with arabinose\u2014provide unique structure and function to the resulting pectin. Large quantities of galactose are observed in tension wood, for example\u2014a form of wood especially adept at weathering the elements.      Could bendy trees make better biofuels?So why all that trouble to understand a single enzyme with a very specific role? According to Bomble, the long-term goal is being able to tweak the concentrations of sugars in plant cell walls generally and in pectin and hemicelluloses more precisely.\"We want to be able to control the ratio of all the different components to give lignocellulosic materials the properties that we want,\" Bomble explained.Overexpressing or modifying enzymes like GalS1 could influence the properties of cell walls, changing the chemical composition of pectin and other key polymers. For example, GalS1 might be one of the enzymes involved in imparting extra flexibility in key areas of a plant, such as in tree limbs susceptible to a spring snowstorm.Bomble said that scientists in the future might be able to modify GalS1 to add even more galactose, or even glucose, favored in processes for making biofuels.\"Microbes usually have an easier time converting C6 sugars, like galactose, than C5 sugars, like arabinose,\" he said. \"It would be better to have higher concentrations of C6 sugars in the plant cell wall to upgrade them into useful products.\"Of course, Bomble and Bharadwaj caution that effectively modifying enzymes will require many more focused, peer-reviewed scientific studies. As Bharadwaj said, \"What will happen to the strength of these plant cell walls when you shift that C5 to C6 ratio? We don't know enough about it.\"For now, next time you see branches rocking in the wind or flexing under the snow, think about GalS1 and the numerous other enzymes needed to achieve the feat. Those same enzymes could hold the keys to more efficient, cost-effective routes to sustainable biofuels and bioproducts.

  "text": "A new method for analyzing protein crystals\u2014developed by Cornell University researchers and given a funky two-part name\u2014could open up applications for new drug discovery and other areas of biotechnology and biochemistry.          The development, outlined in a paper published March 3 in Nature Communications, provides researchers with the tools to interpret the once-discarded data from X-ray crystallography experiments\u2014an essential method used to study the structures of proteins. This work, which builds on a study released in 2020, could lead to a better understanding of a protein's movement, structure and overall function.Protein crystallography produces bright spots, known as Bragg peaks, from the crystals, providing high-resolution information about the shape and structure of a protein. This process also captures blurry images\u2014patterns and clouds related to the movement and vibrations of the proteins\u2014hidden in the background of the Bragg peaks.These background images are typically discarded, with priority given to the bright Bragg peak imagery that is more easily analyzed.\"We know that this pattern is related to the motion of the atoms of the protein, but we haven't been able to use that information,\" said lead author Steve Meisburger, a former postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Nozomi Ando, associate professor of chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences. \"The information is there, but we didn't know how to use it. Now we do.\"Meisburger worked closely with Ando to develop the robust workflow to decode the weak background signals from crystallography experiments called diffuse scattering. This allows researchers to analyze the total scattering from crystals, which depends on both the protein's structure and the subtle blur of its movements.Their two-part method\u2014which the team dubbed GOODVIBES and DISCOBALL\u2014simultaneously provides a high-resolution structure of the protein and information on its correlated atomic movements.GOODVIBES analyzes the X-ray data by separating the movements\u2014subtle vibrations\u2014of the protein from other proteins that might be moving around it. DISCOBALL independently validates these movements for certain proteins directly from the data, allowing researchers to trust the results from GOODVIBES and understand what the protein might be doing.Ando said that while the potential for using diffuse scattering has been recognized for a long time, the act of accurately measuring the subtle signal while processing the data for something useful has been very difficult to do.\"It is much more computationally intensive to analyze than trying to analyze crystallography data alone,\" Ando said. \"We have a lot more data to deal with in diffuse scattering, because we are looking everywhere all at once, and the signal is also very nuanced.\"The overarching goal, Ando said, is to turn GOODVIBES and DISCOBALL into a genuine structural technique that can be used by researchers at synchrotrons all over the world.\"There is a lot of interest within the structural biology and biochemistry fields to use this signal,\" Ando said. \"We weren't satisfied with just understanding what's contained in the signal; it was really important for us to make the next step of creating the tools, and making GOODVIBES and DISCOBALL available for others to use these tools and test their hypotheses.\"These methods were developed using lysozyme proteins collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS); the Ando group will be returning to CHESS this spring to collaborate with Meisburger, now a CHESS staff scientist, on more complex protein structures using their new method.By isolating the internal motion signals from total scattering data of these complex proteins, researchers can learn more about how proteins move and interact with other important molecules. This information can be used to design new drugs and therapies that target specific proteins. More information:Steve P.

However, new research published in Chemical Science is shining a light on enzymes from fungi that could make biofuels economically viable.       Enzymes called lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, or LPMOs, excel at breaking down organic matter, but exactly how they work has been unclear. Typical enzymes are made of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen, but LPMOs also contain copper.Researchers using neutron scattering at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have already shown how LPMOs bind oxygen to copper to break down biomass.

  "answer_squad": " bismuth oxyiodide",
  "text": "A team of researchers, jointly led by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, have discovered that a solar cell material\u2014bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI)\u2014is capable of detecting X-ray dose rates over 250 times lower than the current best performing detectors used commercially. This has the potential to make medical imaging safer, and open up new opportunities in non-invasive diagnostics, such as X-ray video techniques. Their results are reported in the journal Nature Communications.          \"We have developed BiOI single crystals into X-ray detectors that work over 100 times better than the current state-of-the-art for medical imaging,\" said Dr. Robert Hoye from the University of Oxford, who led the work. \"BiOI is nontoxic, stable in air, and can be grown cost-effectively and at scale. We are very excited by the potential BiOI has to make the next generation of non-invasive diagnostics more accessible, safer, and more effective.\"BiOI is a nontoxic semiconductor that absorbs visible light and is stable in air. Owing to these qualities, over the past decade there has been a surge of interest in this material for solar cells (turning sunlight into clean electricity), photoelectrochemical cells (turning sunlight into fuels) and energy harvesting to power smart devices, among many other applications.BiOI contains two heavy elements\u2014bismuth and iodine\u2014which allows the material to strongly absorb X-rays. However, previous attempts to make BiOI into X-ray detectors were ineffective due to significant energy losses from defects arising from the nanocrystalline nature of the detectors made.The researchers developed and patented a method to grow high-quality single crystals of BiOI using a scalable vapor-based approach. The low defect density in these crystals led to stable and ultra-low dark currents, which was critical to substantially improve the sensitivity and detection limit of this material to X-rays.\"Showing that these simply-processed, low-temperature grown, stable crystals can give such high sensitivity for X-ray detection is quite remarkable,\" said Professor Judith Driscoll from Cambridge's Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, who co-led the work. \"We began working on this material, BiOI, several years ago, and we find it outshines other rival materials in a range of optoelectronic and sensing applications, when toxicity and performance are considered together.\"The researchers formed an interdisciplinary team to understand why BiOI works so well as an X-ray detector. They used advanced optical techniques to resolve processes taking place over a trillionth of a second, and coupled these with simulations to link these processes with what is happening at the atomic level.      Through this study, the team revealed the unusual way in which electrons couple to vibrations in the lattice. Unlike other bismuth-halide compounds, the electrons in BiOI remain delocalized, meaning that electrons can easily and rapidly move within the lattice of BiOI. At the same time, the unusual electron coupling with lattice vibrations results in an irreversible energy loss channel that would still be present even if the material were defect-free.The researchers found that these losses can be overcome by cooling down the sample to reduce thermal energy, or by applying an electric field to rip away electrons from the lattice. The latter case is ideally matched with how X-ray detectors operate. By applying a small electric field, electrons can be transported over a millimeter length-scale, allowing the efficient extraction of electrons generated in the single crystals through the absorption of X-rays.\"We have built a microscopic quantum mechanical model of electrons and ions that can fully explain the remarkable optoelectronic properties of BiOI that make it such a good material for X-ray detection,\" said Dr. Bartomeu Monserrat from Cambridge's Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, who co-led the project. \"This gives us a roadmap for designing even more materials with similarly advantageous properties.\"This work offers important insights into how delocalised charge-carriers can be achieved in bismuth-halide compounds. The researchers are now working on applying these insights to design materials with similarly advantageous properties as BiOI, as well as how to tune the composition of BiOI to improve its transport properties further. They are also working on bringing the unique benefits of BiOI to society by devising routes to increase the size of the BiOI detectors, while preserving the exceptional properties found in single crystals.

  "question_squad": " What is the main food source for mosquitoes?",
  "answer_squad": " nectar",
  "text": "Theories abound for why some people are mosquito magnets while others get off bite-free. A team of researchers from Virginia Tech report May 10 in the journal iScience that washing with some soaps attracted mosquitoes, while other soaps were repellent, but these effects varied between different people as a result of interactions between the soaps and each person's unique odor profile.          \"It's remarkable that the same individual that is extremely attractive to mosquitoes when they are unwashed can be turned even more attractive to mosquitoes with one soap, and then become repellent or repulsive to mosquitoes with another soap,\" says senior author and neuroethologist Cl\u00e9ment Vinauger.Humans have been using soaps and other perfumed personal products since antiquity. We know that soaps change our perception of each other's body odor, but it's less clear whether these products also change how mosquitoes perceive and discriminate between us as possible blood donors. Mosquitoes don't feed on blood alone\u2014in fact, their main food source is plant nectar\u2014so dousing ourselves with plant-derived or plant-mimicking scents could potentially confuse their decision-making.To explore the relationship between soap application and attractiveness to mosquitoes, the researchers first characterized the chemical odors emitted by four human volunteers, both when unwashed and after they'd washed themselves with each of four brands of soap\u2014Dial, Dove, Native, and Simple Truth. They also characterized the odor profiles of the soaps themselves.The team found that each of the volunteers emitted their own unique odor profile, some of which were more attractive to mosquitoes than others. Soap-washing significantly changed these odor profiles, and not only by adding floral fragrances to the mix.\"Everybody smells different, even after the application of soap; your physiological status, the way you live, what you eat, and the places you go all affect the way you smell,\" says co-author and biologist Chlo\u00e9 Lahond\u00e8re. \"And soaps drastically change the way we smell, not only by adding chemicals, but also by causing variations in the emission of compounds that we are already naturally producing.\"Next, the researchers compared the relative attractiveness of each human volunteer to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes when unwashed versus an hour after using the different soaps. Because male mosquitoes feed exclusively on nectar, and females only feed on blood after mating, the researchers exclusively tested the attractiveness for adult female mosquitoes who had recently mated. They also excluded the effects of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2)\u2014another important cue for mosquitoes\u2014by conducting the mosquito preference trials on fabric that had absorbed the human volunteer's odors rather than on the humans themselves.      Soap-washing impacted the mosquitoes' preferences, but the size and direction of this impact differed between soap types and between the human volunteers. Washing with Dove and Simple Truth increased the attractiveness of some (but not all) volunteers, while washing with Native soap tended to repel mosquitoes.\"What really matters to the mosquito is not the most abundant chemical, but rather the specific associations and combinations of chemicals, not only from the soap, but also from our personal body odors,\" says Vinauger. \"All of the soaps contained a chemical called limonene which is a known mosquito repellent, but in spite of that being the main chemical in all four soaps, three out of the four soaps we tested increased mosquitoes' attraction.\"\"We know that ratios of chemicals are extremely important for determining whether mosquitoes are attracted or repelled,\" says Lahond\u00e8re. \"Changing the ratio of the same exact chemicals can result in attraction, indifference, or repulsion.\"To identify the specific ingredients that attract and repel mosquitoes, the researchers analyzed the chemical compositions of the different soaps in light of their impacts on mosquito preference. They identified four chemicals associated with mosquito attraction and three chemicals associated with repulsion, including a coconut-scented chemical that is a key component in American Bourbon and a floral compound used to treat scabies and lice. The team combined these chemicals to create and test attractive and repellent odor blends, which had strong impacts on mosquito preference.\"With these mixtures, we eliminated all the noise in the signal by only including those chemicals that the statistics were telling us are important for attraction or repulsion,\" says Vinauger. \"I would choose a coconut-scented soap if I wanted to reduce mosquito attraction.\"The team intends to expand these results and find some general patterns or rules by testing more soap varieties and many more people. They also plan to explore how soap impacts mosquito preference over a longer period of time. \"We're very curious to look at the time course of this effect\u2014so for example, if you take a shower in the morning, does it still matter to mosquitoes in the evening?\" says Vinauger.

  "text": "An unusual quasicrystal has been discovered by a team from the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU), the University of Sheffield and Xi'an Jiaotong University. It has a dodecagonal honeycomb structure that has never been seen before. Until now, similar quasicrystals were only known to come in a solid\u2014not liquid\u2014form. The team presents its results in the journal Nature Chemistry.          Quasicrystals have a special structure. They have a regular pattern similar to normal crystals, however, in normal crystals, the arrangement of the individual components is repeated over and over at regular intervals. In the case of quasicrystals, the components do not fit together in such a periodic pattern. This special structure gives them special properties that normal crystals do not have.The newly discovered quasicrystal consists of dodecagons, which in turn are made up of a mixture of triangular, square and, for the first time, trapezoidal shaped cells. These are generated from the self-assembly of \"T-shaped\" molecules. \"We have discovered a perfectly ordered liquid quasicrystal. Such a material has never been seen before,\" says chemist Professor Carsten Tschierske at MLU.The team's latest study also provides new insights into the formation of these special structures. \"Until now, it was assumed that the stability of quasicrystals was based on an entropy gain resulting from the breaking of strict periodic tessellation rules. However, our results suggest that, in this case, the stability may be due to energy minimization in the perfect quasicrystalline order,\" Tschierske adds.According to the researcher, the potential applications for these new liquid quasicrystals are promising. For example, they could be used in the future to produce functional self-assembling and self-healing materials which could be applied in optics and electronics, as they have the potential to create new ways to manipulate light and charge carriers.

  "answer_squad": " breathalyzer",
  "text": "With each breath, humans exhale more than 1,000 distinct molecules, producing a unique chemical fingerprint or \"breathprint\" rich with clues about what's going on inside the body.          For decades, scientists have sought to harness that information, turning to dogs, rats and even bees to literally sniff out cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis and more.Scientists from CU Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have made an important leap forward in the quest to diagnose disease using exhaled breath, reporting that a new laser-based breathalyzer powered by artificial intelligence (AI) can detect COVID-19 in real-time with excellent accuracy.The results were published April 5 in the Journal of Breath Research.\"Our results demonstrate the promise of breath analysis as an alternative, rapid, non-invasive test for COVID-19 and highlight its remarkable potential for diagnosing diverse conditions and disease states,\" said first author Qizhong Liang, a Ph.D. candidate in JILA and the Department of Physics at CU Boulder. JILA is a partnership between CU Boulder and NIST.The multidisciplinary team of physicists, biochemists and biologists is now shifting its focus to a wide range of other diseases in hopes that the \"frequency comb breathalyzer\"\u2014born of Nobel Prize-winning technology from CU\u2014could revolutionize medical diagnostics.\"There is a real, foreseeable future in which you could go to the doctor and have your breath measured along with your height and weight\u2026Or you could blow into a mouthpiece integrated into your phone and get information about your health in real-time,\" said senior author Jun Ye, a JILA fellow and adjoint professor of physics at CU Boulder. \"The potential is endless.\"A COVID-born collaborationAs far back as 2008, Ye's lab reported that a technique called frequency comb spectroscopy\u2014essentially using laser light to distinguish one molecule from another\u2014could potentially identify biomarkers of disease in human breath.The technology lacked sensitivity and, more importantly, the capability to link specific molecules to disease states, so they never tested it for diagnosing illness.But Ye's team has since improved the sensitivity a thousandfold, enabling detection of trace molecules at the parts-per-trillion level. They've also harnessed the power of AI.\"Molecules increase or decrease in concentrations when associated with specific health conditions,\" said Liang. \"Machine learning analyzes this information, identifies patterns and develops criteria we can use to predict a diagnosis.\"With SARS-CoV-2 ripping across the country and frustration mounting about long response times for existing tests, the time had come to test the system on people. As a physicist, Ye had never worked with human subjects, so he enlisted help from CU's BioFrontiers Institute, an interdisciplinary hub for biomedical research which was heading up the campus COVID testing program.      Non-invasive, fast, chemical-freeBetween May 2021 and January 2022, the research team collected breath samples from 170 CU Boulder students who had, in the previous 48 hours, taken a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, either by submitting a saliva or a nasal sample.Half had tested positive, half negative. (For safety reasons, volunteer participants came to an outdoor campus parking lot, blew in a sample-collection bag and left it for a lab tech waiting at a safe distance.)Overall, the process took less than one hour from collection to result.When compared to PCR, the gold standard COVID test, breathalyzer results matched 85% of the time. For medical diagnostics, accuracy of 80% or greater is considered \"excellent.\"The resesarchers suspect that the accuracy would likely have been higher if the breath and saliva/nasal swab samples were collected at the same time.Unlike a nasal swab, the breathalyzer is non-invasive. And unlike a saliva sample, users are not asked to refrain from eating, drinking or smoking before using it. It doesn't require costly chemicals to break down the sample. And the new test could, conceivably, be used on individuals who are not conscious.But there is still much to be learned, said Ye.\"With one breath, we can collect so many data points from you, but then what? We only understand how a few molecules correlate with specific conditions,\" Ye said.Building a smaller breathalyzerToday, the \"breathalyzer\" consists of a complex array of lasers and mirrors about the size of a banquet table.A breath sample is piped in through a tube as lasers fire invisible mid-infrared light at it at thousands of different frequencies. Dozens of tiny mirrors bounce the light back and forth through the molecules so many times that in the end, the light travels about 1.5 miles.Because each kind of molecule absorbs light differently, breath samples with a different molecular make-up cast distinct shadows. The machine can distinguish between those different shadows or absorption patterns, boiling millions of data points down to\u2014in the case of COVID\u2014a simple positive or negative, in a matter of seconds.Efforts are already underway to miniaturize such systems to a chip scale, allowing for what Liang imagines as \"real-time, self-health monitoring on the go.\" The potential does not end there.\"What if you could find a signature in breath that could detect pancreatic cancer before you were even symptomatic. That would be the home run,\" said molecular biologist and co-author Leslie Leinwand, chief scientific officer for BioFrontiers and a co-author on the studyElsewhere, scientists are working to develop a Human Breath Atlas, which maps each molecule in the human exhale and correlates them with health outcomes. Liang hopes to contribute to such efforts with a larger-scale collection of breath samples.Meanwhile, the team is collaborating with pediatric and respiratory specialists at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus to explore how the breathalyzer can not only diagnose diseases but also enable scientists to better understand them, offering hints about immune responses, nutritional deficiencies and other factors that could contribute to or exacerbate illness.\"If you think about dogs, they evolved over thousands of years to smell many different things with remarkable sensitivity,\" said Ye. \"We are just at the very beginning of training our laser-based nose. The more we teach it, the smarter it will be come.\" More information:Qizhong Liang et al, Breath analysis by ultra-sensitive broadband laser spectroscopy detects SARS-CoV-2 infection, Journal of Breath Research (2023).

  "text": "A team of scientists from the University of Ottawa has developed an innovative technique to manufacture complex chemical structures from easily accessible substrates, making it one of the simplest and most practical methods for converting alcohols into their arylated equivalents.          This innovative method for performing the reaction, namely the deoxygenative Suzuki-Miyaura arylation of aliphatic alcohols, uses two distinct metal catalysts. Their reaction operates under mild reaction conditions with minimal waste products and is expected to have a significant impact on the creation of new molecules. As a result, it will contribute to advances in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and related industries.The study has been published in Nature Synthesis.This research was carried out at the University of Ottawa's Newman Lab under the supervision of Professor Stephen G. Newman, an associate professor of chemistry and biomolecular sciences at the Faculty of Science who holds a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in Sustainable Catalysis. The lead author of the research was Adam Cook, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate, and the second author was Piers St. Onge, a third-year Ph.D. candidate.\"The chemical reaction that we have developed, making extensive use of the high-throughput labs in uOttawa's Centre for Catalysis Research and Innovation, eliminates previous limitations in Suzuki-Miyaura arylations by offering a surprisingly simple method to achieve the direct derivatization of a broad range of easily accessible alcohols,\" explains Cook.\"By using these molecules as starting materials instead of more established organohalides, this method generates water as a waste product rather than metal-halide salts. This reaction not only provides an effective method for generating complex, medicinally relevant structures from accessible materials, but also contributes to fundamental developments in how chemical feedstocks may be directly transformed into important materials using catalysis,\"Current methods for Suzuki-Miyaura arylation, one of the most widely used chemical reactions in the world, require multiple synthetic steps to obtain the necessary starting materials.By developing a method that allows naturally abundant alcohols to be used directly in these transformations, \"we eliminate the need for these wasteful and time-consuming synthetic steps, thereby streamlining the process of converting naturally abundant substances into value-added products. Additionally, we were able to pursue a unique mechanistic hypothesis on route towards this goal through cross-coupling reactions via an SN1-type pathway,\" says Cook.This is a previously underexplored topic in synthetic chemistry and the team of researchers hopes that their work will serve as a valuable inspiration to all scientists. \"No matter how 'out there' your hypothesis may be, high-throughput experimentation can help you reach conclusions in a rapid and comprehensive manner,\" says Cook.By harnessing the power of this new technique, scientists can now create a wide range of arylated alcohols with greater efficiency and precision than ever before.

  "answer_race": " How to choose and use perfumes.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the famous perfume that is 100 years old?",
  "answer_squad": " Chanel No. 5",
  "text": "Mother's Day is coming up in Australia and that means a surge in perfume sales. Of course, scents are purchased year-round and not just for mothers. Fragrance sales in Australia will amount to over A$1 billion this year.          The word \"perfume\" is derived from the Latin per fumus, meaning \"through smoke\". The very first account of using perfumes dates back to 1200 BC when a woman called Tapputi mixed flowers, oils and various plants with water or solvents, then extracted their fragrance. The basis of this technique for making perfume is still used today.But how do we smell? What makes perfume appealing? And why does it smell differently on different people?The science of smellA sense of smell is vital to all species on Earth. One study identified African elephants as having the \"best noses\" in the animal kingdom, not to mention the longest ones. It can help animals sniff out danger, food and mates.For humans, too, being able to smell is not just for the enjoyment of pleasant odors. It can also protect us from toxic chemicals with noxious smells, such as hydrogen cyanide.When something has an odor, it means it is chemically volatile\u2014vaporizing from a liquid to a gas. When we smell a scent, gas molecules enter our nose and stimulate specialized nerve cells called olfactory sensory neurons. When these neurons are triggered, they send a signal to the brain to identify the chemicals.Humans have around 10 million of those neurons and around 400 scent receptors. The human nose can distinguish at least 1 trillion different odors, from freshly brewed coffee to wet dog to moldy cheese.The more volatile a compound is the lower its boiling point and, from a chemical perspective, the weaker the forces holding the molecules together. When this is the case, more molecules enter the gaseous state and the smell is more intense.      What makes things smell good though?Different classes of chemical compounds can have more pleasant or offensive scents.Fish and decaying animal cells, for example, release chemicals called amines, which don't smell appealing.Fruits, on the other hand, are composed of chemicals in a class of organic compounds called aldehydes, esters and ketones, which have sweeter and more pleasant odors.Chemists have been able to identify the specific chemical smells released by substances we encounter in everyday life.Smells differentSo it makes sense that pleasant-smelling aldehydes, ketones and esters are used to create perfumes. However, some perfumes also contain unusual ingredients that don't smell nice on their own.For example, Chanel No. 5 perfume\u2014the iconic 100-year-old favorite\u2014contains civet as one of its base chemical notes. Civet is used by perfumers for its long-lasting, musky scent. It is traditionally extracted from the anal glands of civet cats but Chanel has used a synthetic form of civet since 1998.Tips for choosing and using perfumesOur ability to smell a perfume will depend on two factors: how well our olfactory sensory neurons are performing (a virus or infection could affect function, for example) and the volatility of the chemicals in the perfume.1. Try before you buyYou can't really do much about your sensory neurons, but you can increase the intensity of perfumes, such as by warming up the perfume on your skin or applying to pulse points. This will help to give molecules more energy and increase the number of molecules entering the gaseous state.Specific perfumes will not smell the same on different people's skin because the chemicals in them can be affected by the skin's type and condition (dry or oily, acidic or base) and even their diet. Some foods we eat, such as garlic, are released from our bodies through our skin. Those chemicals can mask perfume chemicals.So, it is better to buy someone their tried and true favorite scent rather than risking a new one. And those department store sample sprays can be useful to try before you buy.2. Moisturize before useWhen you spray perfume on very dry skin, some of the perfume's chemicals\u2014the large organic ones that are similar to skin's natural oils\u2014are absorbed by the skin and then into the sebaceous glands. When some notes in a perfume are absorbed this way, it can take on a different smell. That's also why it's better to moisturize skin before spraying perfume, so perfume chemicals stay on the skin for longer.3. Experiment with spraying techniquesTo avoid changes in the scent of your favorite perfume and increase the time the perfume stays on you, you could spray your hair instead. Your hair is porous so perfume molecules might remain there longer. However, most perfumes contain alcohol, which dries out hair. Spraying perfume directly onto a hairbrush first, then brushing your hair, might prevent some of this drying effect.Spraying then walking through a mist of perfume so the chemicals settle on your hair, skin and clothes might work\u2014but you risk losing a lot of precious perfume with that technique.4. Keep it coolTemperature will affect volatility. To keep perfumes lasting longer in the bottle, keep them in the fridge or cool dark place and tightly sealed to prevent your expensive, heat-sensitive scent evaporating into thin air.

  "text": "Making the dynamics of an excited molecule visible is only possible using computationally intensive simulations. Recently, a research team led by Sandra Luber from the University of Zurich has developed a method that speeds up these complex simulations.          Theoretical chemist Sandra Luber wants to know exactly what is going on: How do electrons behave in a molecule when it is excited with a laser pulse and made to oscillate? In experimental setups, researchers measure the energy spectra of the excited electrons with a detector and thereby obtain an electronic adsorption spectrum of the molecule, for example. But what happens to the electrons in the time between the laser pulse and the resulting spectrogram remains hidden\u2014only supercomputers like Piz Daint can make that visible.Calculating such dynamic processes in spectroscopy is time-consuming and cost-intensive, which means that even world-class supercomputers can only simulate small systems. However, Luber, a professor of theoretical chemistry at the University of Zurich, together with her Ph.D. student Ruocheng Han and postdoc Johann Mattiat, recently presented an algorithm in Nature Communications that works ten times faster, and without sacrificing accuracy.Luber and her team employed Piz Daint to model the excited molecules dynamics, including the quantum mechanical states. To do this, they used software packages such as CP2K that contain methods for calculating the quantum mechanical states in the atom or molecule in real time. This enabled them to follow how the wave function of the electrons changed over time after the laser pulse.Most importantly, they could see how the higher energy levels induced by the laser are occupied by the electrons and could take \"detailed pictures\" of the molecule at any point in the experiment. \"This helps us analyze the structure and dynamics of a molecule,\" said Luber.In order to avoid trial and error, the researchers ideally wanted to develop an automated method for speeding up these calculations. Specifically, the algorithm that the team created now optimizes the so-called basis sets of functions that then CP2K, for example, uses for the calculations.The team achieved this by identifying two indicators: one indicator that can be used to capture the importance of each basis function for calculating the spectrum; and another indicator that provides information about how important they are for correctly tracking the quantum mechanical states over time.Using Piz Daint, the researchers tested their new algorithm on various molecules, ranging from molecular hydrogen and water to a silver cluster and zinc phthalocyanine among other important molecules for industry. With the new algorithm, the researchers reached their goal faster and with the same precision, as comparisons of the simulated absorption spectra with conventionally modeled spectra showed. All other quantum mechanical programs besides CP2K that also use atom-centered basis sets could use the new procedure, Luber said.What is going on in the excited moleculesOptimized basis sets already exist for calculations of molecules mainly in the ground state. \"However, such special basis sets for the simulation of excited molecular states did not exist until now,\" Luber said. \"What's more, our newly generated basis sets are even system and environment specific.\"The researchers made this surprising discovery during test simulations of silver atoms within silver clusters, which have different chemical properties depending on the symmetry and environment in the cluster. \"We could observe that our algorithm even finds different basis sets for these different silver atoms,\" said Luber.This means that the algorithm distinguishes the environments in the molecule: If, for instance, the polarization of the electron density is important, the algorithm adds polarization functions; for larger distances from the atom it adds diffuse functions. \"We can see which type of function is important in which area of the atom or molecule. This gives us a lot of additional information about the molecule's chemistry.\" Luber and her team have thus come a lot closer to their goal of knowing exactly what is going on in the excited molecules.

  "text": "Fatigue, accompanied by a modern life style and high-intensity exercise, has become a common human condition. Human health is closely related to the function of immune system, and the impairment of this system will also lead to fatigue. Researchers therefore are working to develop natural anti-fatigue and immune-enhancing compounds without side-effects.          Recently, a team led by Prof. Li Pengcheng from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS) obtained the special sequence of peptides from a monkfish (Lophius litulon) protein, and proved that monkfish peptides had anti-fatigue and immunity-enhancing effects. They also found that monkfish peptides could regulate immune function by regulating receptors involved in inflammatory responses. The study was published in the Journal of Functional Foods.The researchers used a series of separation and purification techniques, including ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography and reverse high-performance liquid chromatography, to obtain specific sequences of peptides. They found the peptides could significantly increase antioxidant enzyme activities, hepatic glycogen and lactate dehydrogenase contents, and decrease blood urea nitrogen and blood lactic acid contents in exercise-induced fatigue mice.In addition, they found the monkfish peptides could enhance spleen lymphocyte proliferation and the activity of natural killer cells in mice. Transcriptomics analysis showed that there were 205 genes up-regulated and 1,040 genes down-regulated after the mice were fed monkfish peptides. The peptides could inhibit inflammatory cytokines activation by down-regulating the chemokine and Nucleotide Oligomerization Domain (NOD)\u2013like receptor signaling pathways, thereby modulating the mouse immune response.\"The monkfish peptides could be applied in health care products associated with anti-fatigue and immunity enhancing,\" said Wang Xueqin, first author of the study.

  "text": "Droplet microfluidics allows for quicker point-of-care testing (POCT), but it is not always as accurate and currently requires an amount of external effort for proper handling.          The Integrated Portable Droplets system, or iPODs, developed by researchers from the Single-Cell Center at Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology (QIBEBT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), is based on an auto flow-focusing droplet reinjection chip that eliminates the need for external pumps and precise fluid control, allowing for portability, lower costs, and a user-friendly method of droplet analysis.The study was published in Analytical Chemistry on April 13.The researchers found results to be promising: The automated style in which the droplets transfer through the instrument reduces the need for manual operation, thereby reducing the chance of error, cross-contamination, and sample loss.They also found a strong linearity of samples measured between 101 to 104 copies of bacteria per microliter with an R2 value of 0.999. The closer an R2 value is to 1, the better the line is able to visually represent how well the iPODs device (the independent variable) can detect and quantify the bacterial species present in the sample (the dependent variable).Additionally, the device cost and subsequent cost of each use are reasonable enough to be affordable on a large scale. Another unique and important aspect of the device is its portability, which allows for the device to be used in a broader setting, such as outdoor settings or decentralized labs.\"In previous reports, droplet reinjection undoubtedly requires precise fluid control, thereby reducing the portability of the device, more seriously, restricting the development of droplet-based nucleic acid amplification testing for POCT,\" said Liu Fengyi, a doctoral student and first author of the study. \"Here, we showed this droplet reinjection chip greatly simplified the experimental setup and operation procedure with low device cost and low reagent consumption.\"Droplet microfluidic testing consists of taking a small amount of fluid for testing, which often features cell manipulation and single-cell or single-molecule analysis. One issue iPODs addresses is the relatively low quantitative detection levels of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) when done in bulk, which just gives an \"all or nothing\" result.Droplet digital LAMP with iPODs makes it highly sensitive and accurate in assessing quantities of nucleic acids present in the sample. The downside to this is the need for precise fluid control and external pumps, all of which reduce portability and increase costs. \"We present a droplet reinjection method capable of droplet distribution without precise fluid control and external pumps, by which the droplets can be passively aligned and detected one by one at intervals,\" said Ge Anle, contributing author and assistant research fellow.Using iPODs, the external pump and the need for precise fluid control are eliminated due to the integration of the droplet generator, heating tool, and fluorescent signal reader all packaged in a small, retractable box.In order for this technology to reach its full potential, some adjustments will be needed in the future, such as improving the stability of the system, and implanting of thermal cycling modules for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Further implant with other cheap chip materials for large standardized production, as well as introduction of fully automated operation processes will make the system more user-friendly.\"Once the device is fully developed, we hope to see the technology used in a wide array of applications, from biochemical testing at a point-of-care level to in a more clinical research-based setting,\" said corresponding author Prof. Ma Bo from the Single-Cell Center.

Treatment of antibiotics in wastewater has become an urgent practical problem that requires immediate attention. The development of effective methods to remove antibiotics from wastewater is crucial to protect both the environment and human health.In this study, the researchers treated antibiotic mixtures using cold atmospheric plasma jet (CAPJ) in combination with plasma-activated water.Using this method, the efficiency of treating mixed antibiotics was found to be higher than that of treating single antibiotics under appropriate conditions. For example, when plasma was used to decompose chloramphenicol, active chlorine was produced, which increased the treatment efficiency of norfloxacin.

  "answer_squad": " organic metal halide hybrid scintillators",
  "text": "A team of Florida State University researchers has further developed a new generation of organic-inorganic hybrid materials that can improve image quality in X-ray machines, CT scans and other radiation detection and imaging technologies.          Professor Biwu Ma from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and his colleagues have developed a new class of materials that can act as highly efficient scintillators, which emit light after being exposed to other forms of high energy radiations, such as X-rays.The team's most recent study, published in Advanced Materials, is an improvement upon their previous research to develop better scintillators. The new design concept produces materials that can emit light within nanoseconds, orders of magnitude faster than previously developed materials, allowing for better imaging.\"Reducing the radioluminescence decay lifetime of scintillators to nanoseconds is an important breakthrough,\" Ma said. \"Using a hybrid material made up of both organic and inorganic components means each component can be used for the part of the process where it is most effective.\"Why is this important?Scintillators are used in all sorts of imaging applications. Health care settings, security X-rays, radiation detectors and other technologies use them and would benefit from better image quality.The new generation of organic metal halide hybrid scintillators developed by Ma's team has numerous improvements over existing ones. In addition to significantly better radioluminescence response, the manufacturing process is simpler than the process used for other scintillators, and it uses abundant and cheap materials.What's different about this scintillator?Think of a scintillator as a sort of translator between two types of energy, taking a form of high energy radiation, such as an X-ray, and converting it into visible light. Less radiation passes through denser parts of an object, and that difference can be used to distinguish higher-density objects, such as bones or metal, from lower-density ones, such as soft tissue. The radiation that passes through an object then interacts with the scintillator, which generates visible light that is detected by a sensor to make an image.Today's scintillators use mainly inorganic materials to transform high energy radiation into visible light for producing images. These materials are rigid, use rare Earth elements, and require energy-consuming, high-temperature manufacturing processes.Ma and his team have been working on zero-dimensional organic metal halide hybrids, with which they have performed pioneering research since 2018. These organic-inorganic hybrids are made of small groups of negatively charged inorganic components, called metal halide clusters, and positively charged organic molecules. They're \"zero-dimensional\" at the molecular level because the metal halide clusters are fully isolated and surrounded by organic molecules.In the first version of scintillators based on this material, the metal halides absorb high energy radiation and emit visible light. In this latest iteration, metal halide components and organic molecules work together. The metal halides absorb high energy radiation and transfer energy to the organic components, which emit visible light.Light emissions from organic molecules take place on the scale of nanoseconds, much faster than the microseconds or milliseconds required for metal halides to emit light.\"The faster the decay of radioluminescence, the more precise we can measure the timing of photon emissions,\" Ma said. \"That leads to higher resolution and contrast in images.\"What's next?With the help of the FSU Office of Commercialization, Ma and his team have filed patents on organic metal halide hybrid scintillators. The office's GAP Commercialization Investment Program provided funding to develop the technology for potential partnerships with private companies, which would make the scintillators available on a wider scale.\"This is a continuation of our push for better materials over the years, from 2018, when we first discovered this class of materials, to 2020, when we used them for scintillation for the first time,\" Ma said. \"This is another major breakthrough.\" More information:Tunde Blessed Shonde et al, Molecular Sensitization Enabled High Performance Organic Metal Halide Hybrid Scintillator, Advanced Materials (2023).

  "answer_race": " To introduce a new research on biofilm formation.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the technique used to study the adhesion of bacteria to surfaces?",
  "answer_squad": " QCM-D",
  "text": "A recent study by Tokyo Tech researchers has found that the biofilm-forming bacteria E. coli adheres firmly to hydrophobic and hydrophilic protein-adsorbing self-assembling monolayers (SAMs) and weakly to hydrophilic protein-resisting SAMs. These findings on how surface chemistry can influence the adhesion of bacterial cells and, in turn, biofilm formation could inform the development of bacteria-resistant surfaces and antibiofouling coatings for biomedical and industrial devices.          Bacterial biofilms are like a double-edged sword. On one hand, they have proven valuable for electricity generation and degradation of toxic materials in water and soil but on the other hand, they are a nuisance when formed inside drinking water pipes, on contact lenses and on biomedical devices. To form biofilms, the bacterial cells first attach to the surface of materials via weak and reversible bonds. Once these bonds mature, the cells release polymeric substances that result in stable and irreversible biofilms.Decoding the mechanism underlying irreversible biofilm formation and its relation to surface chemistry is key to unlocking biofilm prevention technologies. Over the years, scientists have proposed various techniques to narrow down the types of surfaces bacterial cells tend to adhere to. Unfortunately, the influence of surface chemistry and surface topography on biofilm formation have remained ambiguous.Against this backdrop, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Tomohiro Hayashi from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan, set out to address this knowledge gap. In a recent breakthrough published in ACS Applied Bio Materials, the team investigated the adhesion mechanism of the E. coli bacteria on self-assembling monolayers (SAM) comprising different terminal groups, i.e., different surface chemistries, using optical microscopy and a technique called \"quartz crystal microbalance with energy dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring.\"Dr. Hayashi explains, \"We chose QCM-D because it is an ultrasensitive device that can monitor adsorbed masses as small as nanograms using acoustic waves. Similarly, SAMs with tunable terminal groups functionalized on atomically flat QCM sensors were chosen since they can help untangle the influence of surface chemistry from that of substrate topography on bacterial attachment.\"      Studies have shown that bacterial attachment to a surface cannot be fully explained by the conventional mass loading theory. This is because the theory does not explain the positive and negative shifts in the resonant frequency (f) caused by adsorption of additional mass onto the surface, which significantly impacts biofilm formation. Taking this complex behavior into account through a coupled-resonator model, the team examined the changes in f and the energy dissipation (D) of the QCM sensor oscillation and assessed their impact on bacterial attachment and viscoelasticity of the SAM surfaces with different functionalities.                Figure 1. Plot of energy dissipation(D) vs shift in resonant frequency (f) for hydrophobic and hydrophilic protein-adsorbing SAMs and hydrophilic protein-resisting SAM at n =3 (3rd overtone, red) and n = 13 (13th overtone, blue) to understand time progression of bacterial adhesion. Credit: Prof.Tomohiro Hayashi             The microscopy images along with QCM-D data revealed that E. coli adhered firmly to both hydrophobic (methyl-terminated) and hydrophilic protein-adsorbing (amine- and carboxy-terminated) SAMs (Figure 1a and b), forming dense bacterial films. In contrast, it attached weakly to hydrophilic protein-resisting SAMs (Figure 1c), such as oligo (ethylene glycol) and sulfobetaine, and formed sparse and dissipative biofilms.                Figure 2. By estimating the acoustic wave penetration depths at each overtone, the distances of E. coli cells from each SAM surface could be determined, providing a clue on what makes bacterial cells adhere strongly to some surfaces and only weakly to others. Credit: Prof. Tomohiro Hayashi             The team also observed a positive f shift for hydrophilic protein-resisting SAMs, due possibly to the fact that the bacterial appendages of E. coli played role in not only initiating contact with the surface and bonding but also in creating elastic spring-like links with the surface. Further, by estimating the distances of the bacterial cell bodies from different SAM surfaces based on the different acoustic wave penetration depths at each overtone (Figure 2), they provided a possible explanation of why bacterial cells adhere strongly to some surfaces and weakly to others.These valuable insights could help identify surfaces with higher probability of biofilm contamination as well as pave the way for contamination-resistant surfaces. \"Our study can act as practical guide for determining which surfaces are prone to bacterial fouling as well as for designing prevention strategies such as bacteria-resistant surfaces and antibiofouling coatings,\" concludes Dr. Hayashi.

  "text": "A research team led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley has engineered bacteria to produce new-to-nature carbon products that could provide a powerful route to sustainable biochemicals.          The advance\u2014which was recently announced in the journal Nature\u2014uses bacteria to combine natural enzymatic reactions with a new-to-nature reaction called the \"carbene transfer reaction.\" This work could also one day help reduce industrial emissions because it offers sustainable alternatives to chemical manufacturing processes that typically rely on fossil fuels.\"What we showed in this paper is that we can synthesize everything in this reaction\u2014from natural enzymes to carbenes\u2014inside the bacterial cell. All you need to add is sugar and the cells do the rest,\" said Jay Keasling, a principal investigator of the study and CEO of the Department of Energy's Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI).Carbenes are highly reactive carbon-based chemicals that can be used in many different types of reactions. For decades, scientists have wanted to use carbene reactions in the manufacturing of fuels and chemicals, and in drug discovery and synthesis.But these carbene processes could only be carried out in small batches via test tubes and required expensive chemical substances to drive the reaction.In the new study, the researchers replaced expensive chemical reactants with natural products that can be produced by an engineered strain of the bacteria Streptomyces.Because the bacteria use sugar to produce chemical products through cellular metabolism, \"this work enables us to perform the carbene chemistry without toxic solvents or toxic gases typically used in chemical synthesis,\" said first author Jing Huang, a Berkeley Lab postdoctoral researcher in the Keasling Lab. \"This biological process is much more environmentally friendly than the way chemicals are synthesized today,\" Huang said.During experiments at JBEI, the researchers observed the engineered bacterium as it metabolized and converted sugars into the carbene precursor and the alkene substrate. The bacterium also expressed an evolved P450 enzyme that used those chemicals to produce cyclopropanes, high-energy molecules that could potentially be used in the sustainable production of novel bioactive compounds and advanced biofuels.\"We can now perform these interesting reactions inside the bacterial cell. The cells produce all of the reagents and the cofactors, which means that you can scale this reaction to very large scales\" for mass manufacturing, Keasling said.Recruiting bacteria to synthesize chemicals could also play an integral role in reducing carbon emissions, Huang said. According to other Berkeley Lab researchers, close to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions come from the production of chemicals, iron and steel, and cement. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will require severely cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, says a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Huang said that while this fully integrated system can be envisioned for a large number of carbene donor molecules and alkene substrates, it is not yet ready for commercialization.\"For every new advance, someone needs to take the first step. And in science, it can take years before you succeed. But you have to keep trying\u2014we can't afford to give up. I hope our work will inspire others to continue searching for greener, sustainable biomanufacturing solutions,\" Huang said.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the term for molecules that mirror one another?",
  "answer_squad": " Enantiomers",
  "text": "Recognizing and separating enantiomers is a difficult task for chemical engineers\u2014one might say it gives them a bit of a headache.          Enantiomers are molecules with virtually identical compositions that mirror one another, like a left and right hand. In chemistry, this property is called chirality. Despite the similarities in their makeup, so-called left- and right-handed enantiomers often exhibit very different properties. Sometimes a drug has an enantiomer that causes undesirable effects. For example, certain drugs have one enantiomer that can cause a headache, while the other provides relief.More than half of the top 500 drugs used in the United States are enantiomeric, according to Xiao Su, a researcher at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology and an assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Su, alongside UIUC doctoral student Jemin Jeon and research scientist Johannes Elbert, recently developed a system to electrochemically distinguish one enantiomer from its twin.The group's development has significant implications for the drug manufacturing industry. Because new drugs are typically required to be racemic \u2014containing an even 50-50 mixture of left- and right-handed enantiomers\u2014their system would allow drug developers to more easily determine the ratio of enantiomers in a given drug, and eventually lead to more effective methods of separating them.\"When you're producing a drug, you want to know how much of each enantiomer is in there,\" Elbert said. \"It's like a form of quality control.\"Their paper appears in Advanced Functional Materials.To effectively distinguish one enantiomer from its mirrored counterpart, the researchers used a versatile class of metal-containing polymers, also referred to as \"metallopolymers,\" that have been used for energy storage, water treatment, and selective separations. Historically, these metallopolymers have seen limited use for enantiomer recognition because they usually lack chirality, or handedness.By adding a chiral center to the metallopolymers, researchers can use them to electrochemically sense two enantiomeric molecules: for example, the molecules used in valuable pharmaceuticals.      \"The cool scientific advance here is that we're able to prove that these redox polymers with chirality can be very good sensors and interact with their preferred enantiomers,\" Su said.Enantiomer recognition begins with chemically designed building blocks on the polymer, referred to as \"redox-centers.\" Redox-centers allow the polymers to undergo reduction and oxidation (hence the polymers' portmanteau name) by electron transfer. This process allows the redox-centers from the polymers to selectivity bind, and thus sense, an enantiomer by changes in current and potential.\"We've basically created a class of chiral metallopolymers that can serve as platform for many enantioselective studies going forward,\" Su said.Furthermore, the study shows for the first time a phenomenon referred to as supramolecular chirality, an intriguing feature in which the polymer displays more chirality than the redox-center building blocks themselves. The researchers leverage this supramolecular chirality to amplify the sensing effect, an efficient upgrade from past sensing methods.\"With electrochemical methods, there's no need to add anything external like chemical additives,\" Su said. \"It's a sensing method purely based on electrical input and electrical readouts, making it flexible and modular to use.\"Although studies on chiral sensors already exist, many are limited to one-time use. But the Illinois researchers' sensor is mobilized onto an interface, allowing it to be reused.And while their newly developed sensor method is still considered proof of concept, the researchers have already identified their next steps.\"Now that we have proved the sensing and recognition properties, the next step is to translate these properties for separation\" Su said. \"Right now our system works really well for chiral sensing, but beyond that, we want to create devices and even better materials to be able to fully purify enantiomers.\" More information:Jemin Jeon et al, Chiral Metallopolymers for Redox\u2010Mediated Enantioselective Interactions, Advanced Functional Materials (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the group that developed a glycan identification method?",
  "answer_squad": " CAS",
  "text": "Glycans perform varied and crucial functions in numerous cellular activities. The diverse roles of glycans are matched by their highly complex structures, which derive from differences in composition, branching, regio- and stereochemistry, and modification. This incomparable structural diversity is challenging to the structural analysis of glycans.          Recently, a joint research group led by Prof. Qing Guangyan and Prof. Liang Xinmiao from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has developed a glycan identification method based on nanopore single-molecule sensing through a glycan derivatization strategy. The study was published in Nature Communications on March 28.Identifying and sequencing glycans using nanopore single-molecule techniques has sparked interest; however, it has achieved little progress over the past dozen years. Only a handful of cases that focused on either high molecular weight polysaccharides or some monosaccharides were reported.For smaller but structurally more diverse glycans with greater biological significance, single molecule detection with nanopores has not yet been achieved, largely because the fast passage of glycans through a nanopore cannot be sensed due to the small size and weak affinity of the glycan with the nanopore.To address the challenge, the researchers introduced a derivatization strategy by linking an aromatic-type tag group to small glycans via a high-efficiency and facile reductive amination reaction. The resulting tagged glycan was sensed with a wild-type aerolysin nanopore by presenting strong nanopore blockage signals.The researchers obtained a scatter plot based on blockage current and dwell time as the fingerprint map by processing the nanopore single-molecule blockage events. They identified different glycan isomers, glycans with varying lengths, and branched simple glycans.Moreover, they revealed that multiple cation-\u03c0 interactions between the aromatic tag of glycan with K238 residues of the nanopore interface retarded the translocation of the tagged glycan and contributed to sensing.\"This study pushes the boundary of nanopore sensing beyond its traditional focus on nucleic acid and protein, and activates its power in the glycomics and glycoscience field, which might pave the way towards nanopore glycan sequencing,\" said Prof. Qing.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the X-ray spectroscopy technique used to capture ferricyanide?",
  "answer_squad": " X-ray Correlation Spectroscopy",
  "text": "Researchers at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory captured one of the fastest movements of a molecule called ferricyanide for the first time by combining two ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy techniques. They think their approach could help map more complex chemical reactions like oxygen transportation in blood cells or hydrogen production using artificial photosynthesis.          The research team from SLAC, Stanford and other institutions started with what is now a fairly standard technique: They zapped a mixture of ferricyanide and water with an ultraviolet laser and bright X-rays generated by the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray free-electron laser. The ultraviolet light kicked the molecule into an excited state while the X-rays probed the sample's atoms, revealing features of ferricyanide's atomic and electronic structure and motion.What was different this time is how the researchers extracted information from the X-ray data. Instead of studying only one spectroscopic region, known as the K\u03b2 main emission line, the team captured and analyzed a second emission region, called valence-to-core, which has been significantly more challenging to measure on ultrafast timescales. Combining information from both regions enabled the team to obtain a detailed picture of the ferricyanide molecule as it evolved into a key transitional state.The team showed that ferricyanide enters an intermediate, excited state for about 0.3 picoseconds\u2014or less than a trillionth of a second\u2014after being hit with a UV laser. The valence-to-core readings then revealed that following this short-lived, excited period, ferricyanide loses one of its molecular cyanide \"arms,\" called a ligand. Ferricyanide then either fills this missing joint with the same carbon-based ligand or, less likely, a water molecule.\"This ligand exchange is a basic chemical reaction that was thought to occur in ferricyanide, but there was no direct experimental evidence of the individual steps in this process,\" SLAC scientist and first author Marco Reinhard said. \"With only a K\u03b2 main emission line analysis approach, we wouldn't really be able to see what the molecule looks like when it is changing from one state to the next; we'd only obtain a clear picture of the beginning of the process.\"\"You want to be able to replicate what nature does to improve technology and increase our foundational scientific knowledge,\" SLAC senior scientist Dimosthenis Sokaras said. \"And in order to better replicate natural processes, you have to know all of the steps, from the most obvious to those that happen in the dark, so to speak.\"In the future, the research team wants to study more complex molecules, such as hemeproteins, which transport and store oxygen in red blood cells\u2014but which can be tricky to study because scientists do not understand all the intermediate steps of their reactions, Sokaras said.The research team refined their X-ray spectroscopy technique at SLAC's Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) and LCLS over many years, and then combined all this expertise at LCLS's X-ray Correlation Spectroscopy (XCS) instrument to capture the molecular structural changes of ferricyanide. The team published their results today in Nature Communications.\"We leveraged both SSRL and LCLS to complete the experiment. We couldn't have finished developing our method without access to both facilities and our longstanding collaboration together,\" said Roberto Alonso-Mori, SLAC lead scientist. \"For years, we have been developing these methods at these two X-ray sources, and now we plan to use them to uncover previously inaccessible secrets of chemical reactions.\" More information:Marco Reinhard et al, Ferricyanide photo-aquation pathway revealed by combined femtosecond K\u03b2 main line and valence-to-core x-ray emission spectroscopy, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "As the executor of life activities, proteins exert their specific biological functions through interactions such as forming protein complexes. The localization effects, crowding effects, and organelle microenvironments within cells are crucial for maintaining the structure and function of protein complexes.          Recently, a research team led by Prof. Zhang Lihua from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has developed a glycosidic-bond-based mass-spectrometry-cleavable cross-linker, which improves the data analysis throughput and identification accuracy of cross-linking information with good amphiphilicity and biocompatibility. It enables in-vivo cross-linking of protein complexes in live cells and achieves large-scale and precise analysis. The study was published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition on March 30.Chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (CXMS), especially in-vivo CXMS, is a large-scale analysis of in-situ conformation and interaction interface of protein complexes in living cells. However, in-vivo CXMS in living cells faces challenges such as high cell disturbance and complex spectra retrieval of cross-linked peptides.In this study, the researchers incorporated glycosidic bonds into the design of functional cross-linkers based on the high biocompatibility of glucose molecules and the mass spectrometry cleavable feature of glycosidic bonds. They screened and obtained trehalose, a highly biocompatible molecule, as the skeleton molecule and developed a mass spectrometry cleavable cross-linker, trehalose disuccinimidyl succinate (TDS).This cross-linker showed superior cell viability maintenance compared to currently reported membrane-permeable chemical cross-linkers and enabled efficient cross-linking of protein complexes in cells under low disturbance conditions.The researchers found that low-energy glycosidic bond\u2013high-energy peptide bond mass spectrometry selective fragmentation mode reduced analysis complexity of the cross-linked peptide fragment spectra, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of cross-linked peptide identification.They identified conformation of 1,453 proteins corresponding to more than 3,500 cross-linked peptide pairs, and 843 protein-protein interaction information from Hela cells.\"We have accurately realized in-vivo cross-linking and global analysis of protein complexes in live cells, and provided an important toolkit for exploring the interaction sites of protein function regulation in live cell microenvironment,\" said Prof. Zhang.

  "text": "Water oxidation reaction involves a four-electron and four-proton transfer process, which requires an uphill energy transformation and limits the efficiency of the overall photocatalytic water splitting reaction.          Although loading appropriate water oxidation cocatalysts can enhance the performance of water oxidation reactions, the interfacial barrier between the semiconductor and the water oxidation cocatalyst can impede the transfer and utilization of photogenerated charges.Recently, a research team led by Profs. Li Can and Li Rengui from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has developed a strategy to controllably assemble a charge-transfer mediator in photocatalysis, which could increase surface charge-transfer efficiency and photocatalytic water oxidation activity. The study was published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition on March 23.Inspired by natural photosynthesis, the researchers employed partially oxidized graphene (pGO) as a charge-transferring mediator on the hole-accumulating facets of lead chromate (PbCrO4) photocatalyst. The pGO could be selectively assembled on the hole-accumulating facets of PbCrO4 by an ultrasonic deposition process, and cobalt-complex Co4O4 molecules could be anchored on the pGO as water oxidation cocatalyst.Based on techniques such as surface photovoltage spectroscopy, they confirmed that introducing the pGO charge transfer mediator between the hole-accumulation facets of PbCrO4 and Co4O4 molecules could effectively suppress charge recombination at the interface, thus prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated charges and enhancing photocatalytic water oxidation performance.\"The strategy of rationally assembling charge transfer mediator provides a feasible way for accelerating charge transfer and charge utilization in semiconductor photocatalysis,\" said Prof. Li Rengui.

  "text": "Nuclear energy is crucial for producing cleaner energy, but the associated radioactive pollution requires strategic solutions. Cesium (Cs+) is a toxic radionuclide generated from nuclear power plants that demands immobilization and high adsorption methods to prevent environmental pollution.          Although phosphate-based adsorbents are excellent candidates for cleanup, their inefficient ion exchange leads to limited adsorption capacity. The high theoretical adsorption of phosphate adsorbents does not match their experimental adsorption capacities.To remove harmful Cs+ from radioactive wastewater, Pusan National University researchers led by Professor Kuk Cho from the Department of Environmental Engineering have synthesized dittmarite-type phosphates with a layered structure, ideal for easy ion exchange.The team found that their magnesium phosphates had record-high adsorption capacities for Cs+, surpassing standard adsorbents due to exchangeable ions and dissolution-precipitation. Prof. Cho says, \"The presence of exchangeable ions and dissolution-precipitation enabled record-high adsorption capacities for Cs+ that are higher than those of standard adsorbents.\"The study was published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials. Using a one-pot hydrothermal method, the team synthesized KMgPO4\u22c5H2O (KMP) and NH4MgPO4\u22c5H2O (NMP), both of which are dittmarite-type compounds, having a high theoretical adsorption capacity of 754 mg g\u2212 1 and 856 mg g\u2212 1 for Cs+, respectively.The synthesized KMP and NMP had remarkable adsorption capacities of 630 mg g\u22121 and 711 mg g\u22121, respectively, which were 84% of their theoretical adsorption capacities. These experimentally measured adsorption capacity values are the highest among all reported adsorbents for Cs+.Next, the team characterized and analyzed the physical and chemical properties of the phosphates. Based on the Cs+ adsorption performance of KMP and NMP, they showed that these phosphates are not best suited for use in water with high divalent ion concentrations. However, they can still be used in Cs+ readsorption processes, following desorption processes, to concentrate Cs+ and reduce waste volume.Prof. Cho says, \"Cs+ is a popular radionuclide generated from nuclear power plants, and the volume of its waste must be minimized for disposal. To minimize the volume, the adsorbent with higher adsorption capacity is advantageous.\"The study found that the new phosphates efficiently adsorb Cs+, providing a cost-effective method for radioactive waste disposal. This is particularly important in a world where nuclear power plants are expected to increase in number, and proper storage with appropriate adsorbents will become crucial for sustainability.In conclusion, the high adsorption capacities and stability of the synthesized phosphates make them promising candidates to deal with the radioactive waste disposal challenge.

  "text": "Adding long-chain fatty acids can thicken cell membranes and alter the activity of a key enzyme, as LMU scientists have demonstrated in cell cultures.          A characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease are deposits of the amyloid-\u03b2 protein, which clumps together to form plaques in the brain. The amyloid-\u03b2 protein is produced by an enzyme which resides in cellular membranes. A team lead by Prof. Harald Steiner and Dr. Edgar Dawkins from the Biomedical Center Munich at LMU has now shown that the production of amyloid-\u03b2 is influenced by the membrane thickness.Cellular membranes consist of lipid bilayers. By externally adding further lipids, they can be thickened, which alters their properties. In earlier studies, Steiner's team had already demonstrated in cell-free model systems that such changes affect the production of amyloid-\u03b2. This effect arises because the key enzyme for the production of amyloid-\u03b2, the so-called \u03b3-secretase, is localized inside the membrane.Remodeling in the cell membrane alters enzyme activityNow the researchers have demonstrated that these fundamental mechanisms also apply in cells. To this end, they started out by developing methods for modifying the properties of living cell membranes in cell cultures. In this way, they were able to show that the addition of a long-chain fatty acid\u2014a building block of the lipids\u2014did in fact lead to remodeling in the cell membranes. This modulation of the membrane composition was also associated with changes in the activity of the \u03b3-secretase.The way in which this influenced the production of amyloid-\u03b2 proved to be non-uniform: \"Although our goal was to suppress the production of amyloid-\u03b2, we ascertained that the lipid treatments have complex effects on the production of this protein in biological systems,\" reports Dawkins. \"Depending on the genetic background of the cells we used, we were able to reduce or increase the quantities of amyloid-\u03b2.\"Long-term, the scientists see the potential in their results for delivering new impetuses to lipid-based treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease. \"Our study contains important considerations in this regard, which researchers should look into when evaluating potential lipid-based approaches,\" says Steiner, although he emphasizes that their practical implementation remains far off in the future.The findings are published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.

  "text": "A research team led by Prof. Gao Xiaoming at the Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics (AIOFM), Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) recently proposed a new dual-wavelength Faraday rotation spectroscopy (FRS) sensor in the two-component simultaneous detection of nitrogen oxides.          Related research result was published in Sensors and Actuators: B. Chemical.Nitrogen oxides are at the center of atmospheric chemical reactions and influence the concentration of ozone, hydroxyl and peroxy radicals, which are important precursors for the formation of photochemical smog, acid rain and haze pollution. At the same time, nitrogen oxides emitted by agricultural fields, wetlands and other ecosystems play an important role in the global nitrogen cycle.In this research, Prof. Liu Kun and Cao Yuan et al. proposed a two-component simultaneous detection sensor for nitrogen oxides with static magnetic field FRS based on NdFeB ring magnet array in response to the problems of slow measurement rate and lack of selectivity for nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide in traditional chemiluminescence detection of nitrogen oxides.The interaction between two beams of linearly polarized light of different wavelengths and nitrogen oxides in a static magnetic field was facilitated by designing a single-cavity, dual-optical path gas absorption cell and coupling it coaxially to a NdFeB ring magnet array.                Optical layout of the FRS NOx sensor. Credit: Cao Yuan             Aside from that, they recommended that the absorption cell should be less than or equal to the length of permanent magnet ring array. This is to address the issue that the left and right sides of NdFeB ring magnetic array were opposite to the direction of internal axial magnetic field, causing partial cancelation of the magneto-optical signal excited by internal axial magnetic field.By combining wavelength modulation spectroscopy with a static magnetic field, the FRS NOx sensor achieved a detection sensitivity of 0.58 ppb NO2 and 0.95 ppb NO over an optical length of 23.7 m and an integration time of 100s.This work lays the foundation for further developing eddy covariance method-based studies of the soil-plant-atmosphere NOx interface fluxes in ecosystems.

An effective use of sound absorption materials is needed to reduce noise pollution, which constitutes a major environmental and health problem. The current sound absorption materials can be harmful for the environment and often create waste problems at the end of their lifetime.The researchers found that pectin, a polysaccharide that can be extracted from biowastes such as fruit peels, can be converted into a freeze-dried highly porous material. They can outperform commercial sound absorption materials, such as glass wool and other porous materials with similar thickness. The research was published in the Chemical Engineering Journal.\"The porous material prepared in this work demonstrate the great potential of freeze-casted bio-based sound absorption materials to be employed as an alternative material in industrialization and construction, where environmental-friendly materials are needed. They also display low thermal conductivity and excellent thermal insulation performance,\" says Professor Jaana Vapaavuori from the School of Chemical Engineering.The small pores on the walls of the bigger walls constituted a hierarchically porous material. This specific structure could increase the tortuosity (i.e., the path the sound travels inside the material) of the material, which further increases sound absorption, especially at the high frequencies. This type of structure has not been reported before in the context of bio-based acoustic absorbers.\"The material has a structural hierarchy consisting of pores of different dimensions and scales. This type of structuring allowed optimizing the sound absorption performance of the material\u2014the sound can penetrate deep into material, and thus, the viscous and thermal losses in the materials are enhanced,\" says Professor Tapio Lokki from the School of Electrical Engineering.Collaboration with a local storeThe obvious benefit of collecting pectin from biowaste is that the researchers can make use of waste streams that are already being produced. The research team, led by professors Vapaavuori and Lokki are looking for opportunities to utilize locally-produced biowaste for their research.\"Now the work continues into an exploration of how raw material could be sourced directly from a local biowaste. We have been negotiating with a local K-market for waste exchange and a chance to collect the orange peels from their juice pressing machine,\" says Vapaavuori.

  "text": "Research in the International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design, has looked at the potential of various bioflavonoids as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The compounds\u2014narirutin, naringin, neohesperidin and hesperidin\u2014are found in citrus fruits. Their wide-ranging therapeutic and physiological effects are well known. The possibility of repurposing them in the face of the ongoing pandemic is discussed in light of computer modeling of their interaction with the virus' infamous spike protein.          The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters our cells by using a protein called S-protein to interact with a human protein called angiotensin converting enzyme 2, ACE2, present on the surface of our cells. Antiviral drugs that block this mechanism would effectively stop the virus in its tracks. However, finding safe, new antiviral agents is difficult, much better to test a well-known drug or compound and repurpose it for this disease.Pawan Gupta of the Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandals Institute of Pharmacy in Dhule, India, and colleagues have used a computer simulation of the systems to test whether various plant-derived molecules would dock with ACE2 and block entry of the virus. They have found that two of the four molecules tested, naringin and narirutin, can bind to both the S-protein/ACE2 interface and the active site of the S-protein. This means that these natural molecules have the potential to prevent the virus from entering human cells and so might be used to develop treatments for COVID-19.The COVID-19 pandemic has raged since early 2020, although the first of its victims were identified in China in late 2019. While preventative measures and vaccines have all been developed to help us cope with this emergent disease, there remains a need for treatments for those who do catch the potentially lethal disease. Repurposing could allow the rapid development and subsequent approval of antiviral agents given that many of the early-stage toxicity checks and safety trials will already have been undertaken for the use of such compounds in other health contexts.Of course, the current work was done on a computer, \"in silico,\" the next step will be to determine whether the two active, lead compounds can work in the laboratory, \"in vitro,\" and then \"in vivo\" in patients. The team also suggests that the kind of multi-targeting they have demonstrated so far in silico might be seen with other compounds, which could also be used as leads to novel antiviral compounds to tackle COVID-19.

  "answer_squad": " As ingredients are added",
  "text": "A small team of chemists at the Russian Academy of Sciences, has found that metal atoms, not nanoparticles, play the key role in catalysts used in fine organic synthesis. In the study, reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the group used multiple types of electron microscopy to track a region of a catalyst during a reaction to learn more about how it was proceeding.          Prior research has shown that there are two main methods for studying a reaction. The first is the most basic: As ingredients are added, the reaction is simply observed and/or measured. This can be facilitated through use of high-speed cameras. This approach will not work with nanoscale reactions, of course. In such cases, chemists use a second method: They attempt to capture the state of all the components before and after the reaction and then compare them to learn more about what happened.This second approach leaves much to be desired, however, as there is no way to prove that the objects under study correspond with one another. In recent years, chemists have been working on a new approach: Following the action of a single particle during the reaction. This new method has proven to have merit but it has limitations as well\u2014it also cannot be used for reactions that occur in the nanoworld. In this new effort, the researchers used multiple types of electron microscopy coupled with machine-learning algorithms.To test their ideas, the researchers used a carbon substrate with embedded palladium nanoparticles as a catalyst. By studying reactions using such a catalyst with several types of electron microscopes and then training machine learning algorithm with the results, they were able to track a region of the catalyst as it moved through a reaction. They were able to see that there were individual metal atoms as well as clusters in addition to the nanoparticles playing a role in the reaction. Further study showed that approximately 99% of catalytic activity was due to the palladium atoms, rather than the nanoparticles despite them making up just 1% of the palladium mass.

  "text": "When medical companies manufacture the pills and tablets that treat any number of illnesses, aches, and pains, they need to isolate the active pharmaceutical ingredient from a suspension and dry it. The process requires a human operator to monitor an industrial dryer, agitate the material, and watch for the compound to take on the right qualities for compressing into medicine. The job depends heavily on the operator's observations.          Methods for making that process less subjective and a lot more efficient are the subject of a recent Nature Communications paper authored by researchers at MIT and Takeda. The paper's authors devise a way to use physics and machine learning to categorize the rough surfaces that characterize particles in a mixture. The technique, which uses a physics-enhanced autocorrelation-based estimator (PEACE), could change pharmaceutical manufacturing processes for pills and powders, increasing efficiency and accuracy and resulting in fewer failed batches of pharmaceutical products.\"Failed batches or failed steps in the pharmaceutical process are very serious,\" says Allan Myerson, a professor of practice in the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering and one of the study's authors. \"Anything that improves the reliability of the pharmaceutical manufacturing, reduces time, and improves compliance is a big deal.\"The team's work is part of an ongoing collaboration between Takeda and MIT, launched in 2020. The MIT-Takeda Program aims to leverage the experience of both MIT and Takeda to solve problems at the intersection of medicine, artificial intelligence, and health care.In pharmaceutical manufacturing, determining whether a compound is adequately mixed and dried ordinarily requires stopping an industrial-sized dryer and taking samples off the manufacturing line for testing. Researchers at Takeda thought artificial intelligence could improve the task and reduce stoppages that slow down production.Originally the research team planned to use videos to train a computer model to replace a human operator. But determining which videos to use to train the model still proved too subjective. Instead, the MIT-Takeda team decided to illuminate particles with a laser during filtration and drying, and measure particle size distribution using physics and machine learning.\"We just shine a laser beam on top of this drying surface and observe,\" says Qihang Zhang, a doctoral student in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the study's first author.      A physics-derived equation describes the interaction between the laser and the mixture, while machine learning characterizes the particle sizes. The process doesn't require stopping and starting the process, which means the entire job is more secure and more efficient than standard operating procedure, according to George Barbastathis, professor of mechanical engineering at MIT and corresponding author of the study.The machine learning algorithm also does not require many datasets to learn its job, because the physics allows for speedy training of the neural network.Credit: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\"We utilize the physics to compensate for the lack of training data, so that we can train the neural network in an efficient way,\" says Zhang. \"Only a tiny amount of experimental data is enough to get a good result.\"Today, the only inline processes used for particle measurements in the pharmaceutical industry are for slurry products, where crystals float in a liquid. There is no method for measuring particles within a powder during mixing. Powders can be made from slurries, but when a liquid is filtered and dried its composition changes, requiring new measurements. In addition to making the process quicker and more efficient, using the PEACE mechanism makes the job safer because it requires less handling of potentially highly potent materials, the authors say.The ramifications for pharmaceutical manufacturing could be significant, allowing drug production to be more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective, by reducing the number of experiments companies need to conduct when making products. Monitoring the characteristics of a drying mixture is an issue the industry has long struggled with, according to Charles Papageorgiou, the director of Takeda's Process Chemistry Development group and one of the study's authors.\"It is a problem that a lot of people are trying to solve, and there isn't a good sensor out there,\" says Papageorgiou. \"This is a pretty big step change, I think, with respect to being able to monitor, in real time, particle size distribution.\"Papageorgiou said that the mechanism could have applications in other industrial pharmaceutical operations. At some point, the laser technology may be able to train video imaging, allowing manufacturers to use a camera for analysis rather than laser measurements. The company is now working to assess the tool on different compounds in its lab.The results come directly from collaboration between Takeda and three MIT departments: Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Over the last three years, researchers at MIT and Takeda have worked together on 19 projects focused on applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to problems in the health-care and medical industry as part of the MIT-Takeda Program.Often, it can take years for academic research to translate to industrial processes. But researchers are hopeful that direct collaboration could shorten that timeline. Takeda is a walking distance away from MIT's campus, which allowed researchers to set up tests in the company's lab, and real-time feedback from Takeda helped MIT researchers structure their research based on the company's equipment and operations.Combining the expertise and mission of both entities helps researchers ensure their experimental results will have real-world implications. The team has already filed for two patents and has plans to file for a third.

  "text": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be an ideal platform for detecting or extracting metal ions due to their different functional building units and large surface area.          However, most 3D COFs have interpenetration because of the existence of non-covalent interactions between the adjacent nets, which results in decreased surface areas and porosities and thus limits their applications in catalysis and molecular/gas adsorption.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Zeng Gaofeng and Assoc. Prof. Xu Qing from the Shanghai Advanced Research Institute (SARI) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has constructed a novel non-interpenetration 3D COF for Au ions capture by imine bonds in the frameworks. The high surface area and abundant cavities provided high Au3+ capacity (570.18 mg g-1), selectivity (99.5%) and efficiency (68.3% adsorption of maximum capacity in five mins).The study was published in Advanced Functional Materials on April 23.The synthesized BMTA-TFPM-COF displayed good crystallinity with dia topology and a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1,924 m2 g-1. Importantly, the open cavities and exposed C=N bonds from non-fold interpenetration contributed to high capacity, selectivity and stability of Au3+ uptake.The experiments showed the mechanism of Au capture. The protonated C=N bonds due to the influence of the HAuCl4 and the protonated nitrogenous groups could adsorb AuCl4- and reduce Au(III) to Au(I) and Au(0) in acidic solution. Thus, the BMTA-TFPM-COF with abundant exposed C=N bonds could promote the conversion from Au(III) to Au(I) and Au(0) through the protonated C=N bonds, which further verified that the C=N bonds could participate in the reduction of Au(III).This study provides new insights into the development of 3D COFs for Au3+ capture.

  "text": "Quantification of carbon isotopic composition (\u03b413C) of CO2 can trace the source of carbon, which is significant for studying the evolution process of geological fluids, constraining the global carbon budget, and clarifying the mechanism of biological metabolism.          At present, the commonly used isotope measurement technology (mass spectrometry) requires long-time sample pretreatment before testing, resulting in low detection efficiency. In addition, due to the limitation of testing conditions, it cannot be directly applied to in-situ detection in high-temperature and high-pressure environments.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Zhang Xin from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS) reported a rapid in-situ quantitative analysis method for determining the carbon isotopic composition of CO2 using Raman spectroscopy.The study was published in Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy on March 23.The researchers constructed a high-temperature and high-pressure experimental microsimulation device, based on confocal micro-Raman technology and capillary high-pressure optical cell (HPOC). They studied the Raman spectral characteristics of high-purity 13CO2, 12CO2, and their binary mixtures at high temperature and pressure (50\u2013450\u00b0C, 50\u2013400 bar).The results showed that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the characteristic peaks of 13CO2 and 12CO2 both were 2\u20135 cm-1, while the difference in peak position between them was more than 15 cm-1 in the experimental range of temperature and pressure, indicating that the 13CO2 and 12CO2 could be well distinguished by the peak position of characteristic peaks in Raman spectra.Furthermore, by studying the 13CO2\u201312CO2 binary mixtures with different proportions, the researchers discussed the relationship between the peak intensity ratio, and content ratio under different temperatures and pressures (corresponding to density). They selected the peak intensity ratio of 13CO2 to 12CO2 with a reference of the upper Raman characteristic peak (I+13/I+12) or the lower Raman characteristic peak (I-13/I-12) as quantitative indexes to respectively establish Raman quantitative calibration models, which can be used for the in-situ determination of carbon isotopic composition (13CO2/12CO2) of CO2 over a wide \u03b413C under high-temperature and high-pressure environments.\"The establishment of this Raman quantitative method provides an effective detection method for in-situ rapid monitoring of the carbon isotope composition of CO2 in high-temperature and high-pressure experiment system with isotope labeling,\" said Ge Yuzhou, first author of the study.\"With the further improvement in the accuracy and detection limits of the model, it is expected to be applied to in-situ measurement in natural systems with a very low 13CO2 content, such as the fluid inclusions and the deep-sea hydrothermal fluids,\" said Prof. Zhang, corresponding author of the study.

  "answer_squad": " PIDTa-EDOT",
  "text": "Thermoelectric materials, substances that convert temperature difference into electricity, find a multitude of applications involving the conversion of waste heat into useful electrical energy. However, they often need to rely on heavy rare earth elements for efficient thermoelectric conversion.          This, unfortunately, makes them expensive and environmentally hazardous. In recent years, conjugated polymer-based material has received attention as an environmentally benign alternative to the conventional rare earth metal-based thermoelectric materials.Owing to their high charge carrier mobility in the amorphous state, IDT-containing conductive polymers have the potential to reduce thermal conductivity while keeping their electronic conductivity intact. Unfortunately, these polymers suffer from low electronic conductivity, limiting our ability to synthesize high-performance thermoelectric materials from IDT-based polymers.A team of researchers led by Prof. Sukwon Hong Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in Korea have now found a solution to the problem. Equipped with their understanding of plausible reasons for the observed low conductivity, the team designed a novel strategy for developing an IDT-based polymer with improved thermoelectric performance based on dopant (impurity) position controlling within an acetal-functionalized IDT (IDTa) polymer. Their study was made available in Chemistry of Materials.The team chose PIDT-EDOT, a copolymer of IDT and then acetal-functionalized it to form PIDTa-EDOT. Next, they synthesized a Lewis-acid base complex by introducing nitrosyl hexafluorophosphate (NOPF6), a Lewis acidic dopant into the IDTa component. The addition of the acetal group was crucial, since it directed the dopant next to the benzylic position of the polymer skeleton, facilitating the desired dopant position control.\"We showed that the low conductivity of conventional IDT results from their non-polar side chains, which cause the dopant to be located between the polymer chains (backbone) instead of at the side chains. This, in turn, impedes charge transfer. Accordingly, we proposed a strategy that would allow us to place the dopant near the sidechains of the polymer backbone,\" explains Prof. Hong, when asked about the motivation behind the study.Upon testing the PIDTa-EDOT polymer, the researchers observed an improved doping efficiency, condensed \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking, and reduced grain size. These, in turn, imparted a low thermal conductivity of 0.09 W m\u22121 K\u22121 on one hand and 30 times higher electronic conductivity on the other. As a result, the PIDTa-EDOT polymer demonstrated a 6-fold improvement in thermoelectric performance compared to that of pristine PIDT-EDOT polymer.The study thus presents a new approach to synthesizing IDT-based polymers that simultaneously exhibit low thermal conductivity and high electronic conductivity, a prerequisite for developing efficient thermoelectric materials and thermoelectric conversion technology.\"Improved thermoelectric materials could lead to more efficient electricity generation from the waste heat released in industrial processes or even from the human body. This, in turn, could reduce energy consumption and make solar power more practical and cost-effective,\" concludes Prof. Hong.

  "text": "Materials made of spider silk can be specifically modified or processed in such a way that living cells of a certain type adhere to them, grow and proliferate. This has been discovered by researchers at the University of Bayreuth under the direction of Prof. Dr. Thomas Scheibel.          Cell-specific effects of the materials can be generated by biochemical modifications of the silk proteins, but also by surface structuring of spider silk coatings. The research findings, published in Advanced Healthcare Materials and Advanced Materials Interfaces, are pioneering for regenerative medicine and the production of artificial tissue.Spider silk promotes the formation of natural tissue in a cell-specific mannerIn many cases, biomedical restoration of damaged or destroyed tissue depends on stimulating and controlling the development of specific cells. Cells of different types, for example skin, muscle and nerve cells, must be involved in order to create a functioning cell network. A scaffold of spider silk implanted in the body, to which a growing number of newly developing cells attach, provides important prerequisites for this natural rebuilding process: Spider silk proteins are biodegradable and generally compatible with existing cells of the organism.The Bayreuth research results obtained at the Chair of Biomaterials now show how such a scaffold made of spider silk can be optimized. For spatially different sections of the scaffold, materials can be used in the future that are particularly well suited for the targeted attachment, growth and proliferation of cells of a required cell type.As a result, such a spider silk scaffold implanted in the body is ideally suited for the production of large natural tissue structures involving different cell types. It is gradually degraded in a natural way as the tissue regeneration progresses.Spider silk implant coatings suppress rejection reactionsThe results of the two studies will also benefit the optimization of implants that are intended to permanently replace natural tissue and remain in the body. This requires materials that ensure that the implants are not rejected by inflammation or allergic reactions.A coating of spider silk, which is optimally adapted to the respective cell types in the surrounding tissue and promotes their attachment, helps to avoid such rejection reactions and thus contributes to the smooth integration of the implant into the natural tissue.      Cell-specific effects through biochemical modificationsAs the Bayreuth researchers have demonstrated, cell-specific effects of spider silk materials can be produced by functionally modifying silk proteins through the incorporation of peptides, which are short-chain polyamino acids. Peptides that interact with cells (cell-adhesive peptides) are present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of natural tissues: This is a lattice-like molecular structure that fills the spaces between neighboring cells in a tissue and stabilizes their spatial arrangement.The Bayreuth researchers have grafted some cell-adhesive peptides found in the ECM of numerous organisms\u2014including humans\u2014into several variants of a silk protein derived from a spider silk of the garden cross spider. As a result of biochemical modification, some of these altered silk proteins were found to be generally cell-adhesive, while others generally exhibited cell-repellent behavior.In some cases, however, cell-specific interactions were observed in addition. Particularly striking were the effects of the peptide KGD: it specifically promotes the attachment and growth of myoblasts. These are embryonic muscle precursor cells that can develop into muscle fibers.\"Our research results point to a novel pathway leading to cell-specific applications of materials made from spider silk\u2014whether in the design of scaffolds to promote natural regenerative processes, in the coating of implants, or even in the 3D printing of hydrogels with encapsulated cells that can be further processed into functional materials,\" said Vanessa Trossmann M.Sc., lead author of the study published in Advanced Healthcare Materials.Cell-specific effects through surface structuring of spider silk coatingsThe study, published in Advanced Materials Interfaces, presents a different way to optimize spider silk materials. Coatings made from one silk protein derived directly from the silk of the garden spider do not exhibit cell-adhesive behavior on their own\u2014without biochemical modification.The research team led by Prof. Dr. Thomas Scheibel has now used a lithographic process to structure the surface of these coatings in such a way as to specifically stimulate the attachment and growth of cells of a certain type. The reactions of different cells to the shape and size of the geometric structures imprinted in the surface depend strongly on the respective cell type, among other parameters, as extensive tests have shown.\"Based on our research results, it will be possible to lithographically optimize coatings made of silk proteins or other biocompatible materials in such a way that they stimulate and drive the natural regeneration of complex tissue structures in a cell-specific manner,\" says Scheibel.

New publications from North Carolina State University show that water can change its solubility characteristics depending upon what it interacts with. Specifically, when water interacts with cellulose, it can stack in layered shells to control chemical reactions within, and physical properties of, the material. The work has implications for more sustainable and efficient design of cellulose-based products.          \"Cellulose is the world's most abundant biopolymer, and it's used in applications that range from bandages to electronics,\" says Lucian Lucia, professor of forest biomaterials and chemistry at NC State and corresponding author of a new study in Matter. \"But cellulose processing has been mostly done by trial and error, and some of it utilizes incredibly harsh chemicals. To find better ways to process cellulose, we need to understand its most fundamental interactions\u2014for example, with water.\"To do so, he worked with colleague Jim Martin, professor of chemistry at NC State, who studies the fundamental properties of water as a solvent.\"Water has the uncanny ability to change characteristics depending on what it's with, which gives it wide range of solubility characteristics,\" Martin says. Martin is the author of an opinion piece in Matter that is a companion to Lucia's study.\"We change the nature of water by what we dissolve in it, and by the concentrations of those solutes in water,\" Martin says. \"Think of the continuum between Kool-Aid and hard candy.

As you remove the water, you get taffy, then hard candy, then back to crystalline sugar.\"\"We know that water is critical to how cellulose is laid down,\" Lucia says. \"So in this study we probed how it orients itself and plays a reactive role in mitigating or leveraging chemistry.\"The researchers physically manipulated different types of wood fibers and looked at how water bound to itself and other molecules within the resulting structures. They saw that at lower water contents, the water distribution and resulting molecular interactions between the water and the fibers create bridging structures within the material that cause it to lose flexibility.In fact, they saw that the water can \"hide\" itself within the cellulose network, forming strong hydrogen bonds. This bonding in turn dictates the tightness or looseness of the bridging structures.\"The water forms shells around the fibers that can stack, like a nesting Russian doll,\" Martin says. \"The fewer shells, or layers, the harder the fibers. But when you add more layers, the connection between fibers grows farther away and the material becomes softer.\"The researchers hope to explore the variety of bonds water forms within these structures in future work.\"Studying these interactions at the molecular level paves the way toward manipulating water in cellulose to design better products and processes,\" Lucian says. \"Understanding what is happening from fundamental principles lets us design approaches that take advantage of water's properties for everything from drug delivery to designing electronics.\"The research paper, \"Computational and experimental insights into the molecular architecture of water-cellulose networks,\" and the editorial piece, \"Water under the influence of solutes: on the non-innocence of a universal solvent,\" both appear in Matter.

  "text": "The need to capture CO2 and transport it for permanent storage or conversion into valued end uses is a national priority recently identified in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to move toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.          Now, Northwestern University researchers have worked with an international team of collaborators to create acetic acid out of carbon monoxide derived from captured carbon. The innovation, which uses a novel catalyst created in the lab of professor Ted Sargent, could spur new interest in carbon capture and storage.\"Carbon capture is feasible today from a technical point of view, but not yet from an economic point of view,\" Sargent said. \"By using electrochemistry to convert captured carbon into products with established markets, we provide new pathways to improving these economics, as well as a more sustainable source for the industrial chemicals that we still need.\"The paper was published in the journal Nature.Sargent, the paper's corresponding author, is Northwestern's Lynn Hopton Davis and Greg Davis Professor of Chemistry at the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering. His team has a track record of using electrolyzers\u2014devices in which electricity drives a desired chemical reaction forward\u2014to convert captured carbon into key industrial chemicals, including ethylene and propanol.Though acetic acid may be most familiar as the key component in household vinegar, recent University of Toronto Ph.D. recipient Josh Wicks, one of the paper's four co-lead authors, said this use accounts for only a small proportion of what it's used for.\"Acetic acid in vinegar needs to come from biological sources via fermentation because it's consumed by humans,\" Wicks said. \"But about 90% of the acetic acid market is for feedstock in the manufacture of paints, coatings, adhesives and other products. Production at this scale is primarily derived from methanol, which comes from fossil fuels.\"Lifecycle assessment databases showed the team that for every kilogram of acetic acid produced from methanol, the process releases 1.6 kg of CO2.      Their alternative method takes place via a two-step process: first, captured gaseous CO2 is passed through an electrolyzer, where it reacts with water and electrons to form carbon monoxide (CO). Gaseous CO is then passed through a second electrolyzer, where another catalyst transforms it into various molecules containing two or more carbon atoms.\"A major challenge that we face is selectivity,\" Wicks said. \"Most of the catalysts used for this second step facilitate multiple simultaneous reactions, which leads to a mix of different two-carbon products that can be hard to separate and purify. What we tried to do here was set up conditions that favor one product above all others.\"Vinayak Dravid, another senior author on the paper and the Abraham Harris Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, is the founding director of the Northwestern University Atomic and Nanoscale Characterization (NUANCE) Center, which allowed the team to access diverse capabilities for atomic- and electronic-scale measurements of materials.\"Modern research problems are complex and multifaceted and require diverse yet integrated capabilities to analyze materials down to the atomic scale,\" Dravid said. \"Colleagues like Ted present us with challenging problems that stimulate our creativity to develop novel ideas and innovative characterization methods.\"The team's analysis showed that using a much lower proportion of copper (approximately 1%) compared with previous catalysts would favor the production of just acetic acid. It also showed that elevating the pressure to 10 atmospheres would enable the team to achieve record-breaking efficiency.In the paper, the team reports a faradic efficiency of 91%, meaning that 91 out of every 100 electrons pumped into the electrolyzers end up in the desired product\u2014in this case, acetic acid.\"That's the highest faradic efficiency for any multi-carbon product at a scalable current density we've seen reported,\" Wicks said. \"For example, catalysts targeting ethylene typically max out around 70% to 80%, so we're significantly higher than that.\"The new catalyst also appears to be relatively stable: while the faradic efficiency of some catalysts tend to degrade over time, the team showed that it remained at a high level of 85% even after 820 hours of operation.Wicks hopes that the elements that led to the team's success\u2014including a novel target product, a slightly increased reaction pressure, and a lower proportion of copper in the catalyst\u2014inspire other teams to think outside the box.\"Some of these approaches go against the conventional wisdom in this field, but we showed that they can work really well,\" he said. \"At some point, we're going to have to decarbonize all the elements of chemical industry, so the more different pathways we have to useful products, whether it's ethanol, propylene or acetic acid, the better.\" More information:Edward Sargent, Constrained C2 adsorbate orientation enables CO-to-acetate electroreduction, Nature (2023).

  "answer_squad": " 1,2,3-cyclohexatriene",
  "text": "A team of chemists at the University of California, Los Angeles has found that the benzene isomer 1,2,3-cyclohexatriene has the potential to be a versatile reagent in organic synthesis. In their study, reported in the journal Nature, Andrew Kelleghan, Ana Bulger, Dominick Witkowski and Neil Garg conducted experiments with the high-energy compound.          For many years, 1,2,3-cyclohexatriene has been virtually ignored as a useful reagent for use in organic synthesis\u2014it has been considered to be too unstable to be of use. Still, it is promising because it is substantially higher in energy than benzene.Also, isomers of benzene in general have long been of interest to organic chemists because of their potential for synthesizing useful organic materials. In this new effort, the researchers believed that under the right conditions, the isomer 1,2,3-cyclohexatriene could prove to be useful as a reagent for producing a wide range of organic compounds.The team first set about producing samples using a method developed in the 1990s to generate intermediates from a precursor. They then used a variety of techniques to produce an array of fused-ring adducts, all of which were likely to react well, like benzenes, to nucleophiles. They then set to work using the resulting material to determine whether it could be used as an effective reagent.To test the possibility of using it as electrophilic reagent, the team conducted a host of trapping reactions with dimethyl trienes. Then also used sily1 group members to show how nucleophilic reactions could be conducted and also conducted reactions showing the potential of \u03c3-bond insertions. The group also conducted computational studies in conjunction with experimental analysis that showed that derivatives of 1,2,3-cyclohexatriene could be used in certain reactions despite the high degree of reactivity and its limited lifetime.The team also showed that 1,2,3-cyclohexatrienes could be used in synthetic sequences that involve many steps, which, they note, shows their utility in building stereochemically and topologically complex molecules. They conclude that such isomers and their derivatives merit further investigation for use in creating organic materials. More information:Andrew V.

  "answer_squad": " coffee canephora",
  "text": "An article published in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering brings good news for coffee buffs: the plastic in used coffee pods can be recycled to make filament for 3D printers, minimizing its environmental impact.          The solution was successfully tested by research groups in Brazil at the Federal University of S\u00e3o Carlos (USFCar) and the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), and in the United Kingdom at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU).\"We produced new conductive and non-conductive filaments from waste polylactic acid [PLA] from used coffee machine pods. There are many applications for these filaments, including conductive parts for machinery and sensors,\" Bruno Campos Janegitz, a co-author of the article, told Ag\u00eancia FAPESP. Janegitz heads the Sensors, Nanomedicine and Nanostructured Materials Laboratory (LSNano) at UFSCar in Araras, S\u00e3o Paulo state.Brazil is the world's leading producer and exporter of coffee, as well as its second-largest consumer after the United States. Although most coffee consumed in Brazil is low-quality (Coffea canephora, also known as robusta coffee, with a high proportion of defects and impurities disguised by high roasting of beans and plenty of sugar or sweetener in the cup), demand for gourmet and specialty coffees is steadily growing.Comprising selected arabica beans (Coffea arabica) with a lower roast to preserve their natural sugars, aroma and flavor, gourmet coffees score 75-80 on the scale used by the Brazilian Coffee Industry Association (ABIC), which goes from 0 to 100. Specialty coffees must also have what is called a socio-environmental certification and score at least 80 on the scale used by the Brazilian Specialty Coffee Association (BSCA).The quality of the beverage also depends on how it is prepared, and many Brazilians have begun to use the cafeti\u00e8re (also known as French press) or stove-top Moka pot (caffettiera in Italian) instead of the traditional cloth or paper filter. Portable electric espresso machines that use pods are also increasingly popular, albeit far more expensive. The problem with the latter is what to do with used pods.Although reusable pods exist and some suppliers promote recycling of aluminum pods, most consumers just throw used pods into the garbage bin, especially if they are made of plastic. Considering all the factors involved, calculations made by the S\u00e3o Paulo State Technological Research Institute (IPT) show that \"a cup of pod coffee can be as much as 14 times more damaging to the environment than a cup of filter coffee.\"To develop uses for this waste, the researchers produced electrochemical cells with non-conductive filaments of PLA and electrochemical sensors with conductive filaments prepared by adding carbon black to the PLA. Carbon black is a paracrystalline form of carbon that results from incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. \"The electrochemical sensors were used to determine the proportion of caffeine in black tea and arabica coffee,\" Janegitz explained.Production of filament is relatively simple, he added. \"We obtain the non-conductive material simply by washing and drying PLA pods, followed by hot extrusion. To obtain the conductive material, we add carbon black before heating and extrusion. The extruded material is then cooled and spooled to produce the filament of interest,\" he explained.The process is a good example of the circular economy, in which the waste produced by an economic activity is not treated as a problem that harms the environment but converted into resources to implement another activity. \"The polymer base obtained from used pods can generate devices with a great deal of added value,\" Janegitz said.

  "answer_squad": " photosystem II",
  "text": "Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in shaping and sustaining life on Earth, yet many aspects of the process remain a mystery. One such mystery is how photosystem II, a protein complex in plants, algae and cyanobacteria, harvests energy from sunlight and uses it to split water, producing the oxygen we breathe. Now researchers from the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, together with collaborators from Uppsala University and Humboldt University and other institutions have succeeded in cracking a key secret of photosystem II.       Using SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and the SPring-8 Angstrom Compact free electron LAser (SACLA) in Japan, they captured for the first time in atomic detail what happens in the final moments leading up to the release of breathable oxygen. The data reveal an intermediate reaction step that had not been observed before.The results, published today in Nature, shed light on how nature has optimized photosynthesis. The finding will help scientists develop artificial photosynthetic systems that mimic photosynthesis to harvest natural sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into hydrogen and carbon based-fuels.The machinery responsible for photosynthesis\u2014while commonplace and essential to life on Earth\u2014is still not fully understood. One of its molecular mysteries involves how a protein complex, photosystem II, harvests energy from light and uses it to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. This video explains how, in a previous paper, researchers were able to see two key steps in photosynthetic water splitting under conditions as it occurs in nature, a big step to decoding how the process works in detail. Credit: Chris Smith/SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\"The more we learn about how nature does it, the closer we get to using those same principles in human-made processes, including ideas for artificial photosynthesis as a clean and sustainable energy source,\" said co-author Jan Kern, a scientist at Berkeley Lab.Co-author Junko Yano, also at Berkeley Lab, said, \"Photosystem II is giving us the blueprint for how to optimize our clean energy sources and avoid dead ends and dangerous side products that damage the system. What we once thought was just fundamental science could become a promising avenue to improving our energy technologies.\"Bases loadedDuring photosynthesis, photosystem II's oxygen-evolving center\u2014a cluster of four manganese atoms and one calcium atom connected by oxygen atoms\u2014facilitates a series of challenging chemical reactions that act to split apart a water molecule to release molecular oxygen.The center cycles through four stable oxidation states, known as S0 through S3, when exposed to sunlight. On a baseball field, S0 would be the start of the game when a player on home base is ready to go to bat. S1\u2013S3 would be players on first, second, and third. Every time a batter connects with a ball, or the complex absorbs a photon of sunlight, the player on the field advances one base. When the fourth ball is hit, the player slides into home, scoring a run or, in the case of photosystem II, releasing one molecule of breathable oxygen.In their experiments, the researchers probed this center by exciting samples from cyanobacteria with optical light and then probing them with ultrafast X-ray pulses from LCLS and SACLA. The data revealed the atomic structure of the cluster and the chemical process around it.      A homerunUsing this technique, the scientists for the first time imaged the mad dash for home\u2014the transient state, or S4, where two atoms of oxygen bond together and an oxygen molecule is released. The data showed that there are additional steps in this reaction that had never been seen before.\"Other experts argued that this is something that could never be captured,\" said co-author Uwe Bergmann, a scientist and professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"It's really going to change the way we think about photosystem II. Although we can't say we have a unique mechanism based on the data yet, we can exclude some models and ideas people have proposed over the last few decades. It's the closest anyone has ever come to capturing this final step and showing how this process works with actual structural data.\"In photosystem II, the water-splitting center cycles through four stable states, S0\u2013S3. On a baseball field, S0 would be the start of the game when a batter on home base is ready to hit. S1\u2013S3 would be players waiting on first, second, and third. The center gets bumped up to the next state every time it absorbs a photon of sunlight, just like how a player on the field advances one base every time a batter connects with a ball. When the fourth ball is hit, the player slides into home, scoring a run or, in the case of photosystem II, releasing the oxygen we breathe. Credit: Greg Stewart/SLAC National Accelerator LaboratoryThe new study is the latest in a series undertaken by the team over the past decade. Earlier work focused on observing various steps of the photosynthetic cycle at the temperature at which it occurs in nature.\"Most of the process that produces breathable oxygen happens in this last step,\" said co-author Vittal Yachandra, a scientist at Berkeley Lab. \"But there are several things happening at different parts of photosystem II and they all have to come together in the end for the reaction to succeed. Just like how in baseball, factors like the location of the ball and the position of the basemen and fielders affect the moves a player takes to get to home base, the protein environment around the catalytic center influences how this reaction plays out.\"Brighter X-rays for a brighter futureBased on these results, the researchers plan to conduct experiments designed to capture many more snapshots of the process.\"There are still things happening in between that we could not catch yet,\" Kern said. \"There are more snapshots we really want to take which would bridge the remaining gaps and tell the whole story.\"To do so, they need to push the quality of their data even further. In the past, these types of measurements proved challenging because the X-ray signals from the samples are faint and the rates at which existing X-ray lasers like LCLS and SACLA produce X-ray pulses are too small.\"It took quite some effort to optimize the setup, so we couldn't collect all the data we needed for this one publication in a single experiment,\" said co-author and SLAC scientist Roberto Alonso-Mori. \"These results actually include data taken over six years.\"When an LCLS upgrade, called LCLS-II, comes online later this year, the repetition rate will skyrocket from 120 pulses per second to up to a million per second.\"With these upgrades, we will be able to collect several days' worth of data in just a few hours,\" Bergmann said. \"We will also be able to use soft X-rays to further understand the chemical changes happening in the system. These new capabilities will continue to drive this research forward and shed new light on photosynthesis.\" More information:Junko Yano, Structural evidence for intermediates during O2 formation in photosystem II, Nature (2023).

  "answer_squad": " electroroadhesion",
  "text": "If you're a fan of arts and crafts, you're likely familiar with the messy, sticky, frustration-inducing nature of liquid glues. But researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces now have a brand-new way to weld squishy stuff together without the need for glue at all. They've demonstrated a universal, \"electroadhesion\" technique that can adhere soft materials to each other just by running electricity through them.          There's a glue out there for almost any situation, whether it involves plastic, fabric, wood or beyond. But things get a bit tricky when materials are soft and squishy, like tissues or engineered organs. Strategies including 3D-printing avoid glues altogether by fusing together an entire structure\u2014such as an organ\u2014all at once.But this can be slow and laborious, and require advanced technical equipment. Another alternative could be electroadhesion, in which an electric field is used to hold oppositely charged materials together, forming attachments between the materials' components. This can involve chemical bonds, like ionic bonds, or more physical connections, like ensnaring polymer chains together.Plus, it works with little more than a household battery and pencil lead. Previously, Srinivasa Raghavan and colleagues showed that electroadhesion could reversibly hold a gel to a tissue without the need for sutures. But now, they wanted to see if the technique could work for any two materials, given that they had opposite charges, to precisely and reversibly hold them together.To explore the phenomenon, the team tested a gel in addition to three types of capsules made of alginate or chitosan\u2014both naturally occurring polymers\u2014that were either positively or negatively charged. When attached to graphite electrodes and exposed to a 10-V electric field for around 10 seconds, the oppositely charged materials stuck together.This bond was strong enough to withstand gravity, and evidence from previous experiments suggests it could last for years. By reversing the flow of electricity, however, the bond was easily broken. The team assembled chains and even 3D cubes out of individual, spherical capsules.The researchers also used electroadhesion to sort capsules by their charges, either by laying a charged gel on top of several capsules, or by touching them with a fingertip \"robot\" that adhered the capsules to themselves. The researchers say that this work demonstrates the universality of electroadhesion and could one day be used in robotics and tissue engineering. More information:Leah K.

  "text": "A team of international researchers led by Professor Cafer T. Yavuz of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Prof. Bo Liu from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and Prof. Qiang Xu of Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) have developed a promising method for carbon capture and storage.          Methane hydrate is studied for its ability to capture and trap gas molecules such as carbon dioxide under high pressure. However, it is difficult to impossible to recreate these conditions in the lab, and the approach is additionally energy intensive, as the methane-ice solid requires refrigeration. Using a salt\u2014guanidinium sulfate\u2014the scientists have successfully created lattice-like structures called clathrates that effectively mimic the methane hydrate activity, trapping the CO2 molecules and resulting in an energy efficient way to contain the greenhouse gas.\"The guanidinium sulfate serves to organize and trap the CO2 molecules without reacting with them,\" said Cafer Yavuz, professor of chemistry, and director of the KAUST Oxide and Organic Nanomaterials for Energy & Environment (ONE) Laboratory. \"We have discovered a rare example of a clathrate that is stable and non-corrosive at ambient temperature and pressure, a highly desirable feature compared with ethanol amine, ammonia and other solutions that are commonly used in carbon capture.\"Previous carbon capture methods included chemisorption, where chemical bonds form between CO2 molecules and the surface. This process worked well; however, the chemical bonds require energy to break them down, which drives up the cost of the CO2 capture operation. The salt-based, clathrate structure utilizes low energy, physisorption processes while capturing CO2 without water or nitrogen interference, opening a promising venue for future carbon capture and storage technologies through rapid CO2 solidification.The discovery introduces a new way of storing and transporting carbon dioxide as a solid. CO2 is conventionally carried as a solid in the form of dry ice; compressed in gas cylinders; or in the form of carbonates. The salt clathrate allows CO2 to be carried as a solid powder, yielding remarkably high volume per weight capacity, making this method the least energy intensive, with tremendous potential for real life applications.\"Our team made it possible to carry CO2 in a solid form without the need for refrigeration or pressure. You will be able to literally shovel CO2 loaded solids from now on,\" he said. \"The impact is wide and strong, as the global fuel industry and the Kingdom entities are actively looking for ways to capture, store and transport CO2 without significant energy penalties.\"The method could have a significant impact on the fight against climate change, enabling energy-efficient carbon capture and storage. The research team is optimistic that their findings will lead to further improvements in CO2 capture in terms of stability, recyclability, sorption capacity and selectivity, and lowering regeneration energy penalty and cost.The research was carried out at Southern University of Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.

  "text": "Harmful PFAS chemicals can now be detected in many soils and bodies of water. Removing them using conventional filter techniques is costly and almost infeasible. Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB are now successfully implementing a plasma-based technology in the AtWaPlas joint research project.          Contaminated water is fed into a combined glass and stainless steel cylinder where it is then treated with ionized gas, i.e., plasma. This reduces the PFAS molecular chains, allowing the toxic substance to be removed at a low cost.Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have many special properties. As they are thermally and chemically stable as well as resistant to water, grease and dirt, they can be found in a large number of everyday products: Pizza boxes and baking paper are coated with them, for example, and shampoos and creams also contain PFAS. In industry they serve as extinguishing and wetting agents, and in agriculture they are used in plant protection products.However, traces of PFAS are now also being detected where they should not be found: in soil, rivers and groundwater, in food and in drinking water. This is how the harmful substances end up in the human body. Due to their chemical stability, eliminating these so-called \"forever chemicals\" has been almost impossible up to now without considerable effort and expense.The AtWaPlas joint research project aims to change that. The acronym stands for Atmospheric Water Plasma Treatment. The innovative project is currently being run at the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB in Stuttgart in cooperation with the industrial partner HYDR.O.

The aim is to treat and recover PFAS-contaminated water using plasma treatment.The research team led by Dr. Georg Umlauf, an expert in functional surfaces and materials, utilizes plasma's ability to attack the molecular chains of substances. The electrically conductive gas consisting of electrons and ions is generated when high voltage is applied. \"Our experiments with plasma have been successful in shortening the PFAS molecule chains in water. This is a significant step towards efficiently removing these stubborn pollutants,\" Umlauf is happy to report.                Plasma reactor: Plasma is created by applying voltage to the copper electrode. Contaminated water is pumped upwards and flows back down through a gap in the plasma discharge zone, attacking the PFAS in the process. Credit: Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft             Water cycle in a stainless steel cylinderFraunhofer researchers are using a cylindrical construction for this plasma process. Inside is a stainless steel tube, which serves as the ground electrode of the electrical circuit. The outer copper mesh then acts as a high-voltage electrode and is protected on the inside by a glass dielectric. A very small gap is left between the two, which is filled with an air mixture. This air mixture is converted into plasma when a voltage of several kilovolts is applied. It is visible to the human eye by its characteristic glow and discharge as flashes of light.During the purification process, the PFAS-contaminated water is introduced at the bottom of the stainless steel tank and pumped upwards. It then travels down through the gap between the electrodes, passing through the electrically active plasma atmosphere. The plasma breaks up and shortens the PFAS molecule chains as it discharges.The water is repeatedly pumped through both the steel reactor and the plasma discharge zone in a closed circuit, reducing the PFAS molecule chains further each time until they are completely mineralized. \"Ideally, the harmful PFAS substances are eliminated to the point that they can no longer be detected in mass spectrometric measurements. This also complies with the strict German Drinking Water Ordinance (TrinkwV) regulations regarding PFAS concentrations,\" says Umlauf.The technology developed at the Fraunhofer Institute has a key advantage over conventional methods such as active carbon filtering: \"Active carbon filters can bind the harmful substances, but they are unable to eliminate them. This means that the filters must be replaced and disposed of regularly. The AtWaPlas technology, on the other hand, is capable of completely eliminating the harmful substances without any residue and is very efficient and low-maintenance,\" explains Fraunhofer expert Umlauf.                Pilot plant for the elimination of PFAS. Following the initial success of the trials, the technology is now to be optimized and scaled up for practical applications on an industrial scale. Credit: Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft             Real water samples instead of synthetic laboratory samplesIn order to ensure true feasibility, the Fraunhofer researchers are testing the plasma purification under more challenging conditions. Conventional test methods involve using perfectly clean water and PFAS solutions that have been synthetically mixed in the laboratory. However, the research team in Stuttgart is using \"real\" water samples that come from PFAS-contaminated areas.The samples are collected by the project partner HYDR.O. Geologen und Ingenieure GbR from Aachen. The company specializes in cleaning up contaminated sites and also carries out hydrodynamic simulations.The real water samples that Umlauf and his team work with therefore contain PFAS as well as other particles, suspended solids and organic turbidity. \"This is how we verify the purification efficiency of AtWaPlas, not only using synthetic laboratory samples, but also under real conditions with changing water qualities. The process parameters can be adapted and further developed at the same time,\" explains Umlauf.This plasma method can also be used to break down other harmful substances, including pharmaceutical residues in wastewater, pesticides and herbicides, but also industrial chemicals such as cyanides. AtWaPlas can also be used to treat drinking water in mobile applications in an environmentally friendly and cost-effective way.The AtWaPlas joint research project launched in JuIy 2021. After a successful series of pilot-scale tests with a 5 liter reactor, the Fraunhofer team is now working with the joint research partner to further optimize the process.Georg Umlauf states, \"Our current objective is to completely eliminate toxic PFAS by extending process times and increasing the number of circulations in the tank. We also want to make the AtWaPlas technology available for practical application on a larger scale.\" The future could see corresponding plants set up as standalone purification stages in sewage treatment plants or used in portable containers on contaminated open-air sites.

  "answer_squad": " Psilocybe semilanceata",
  "text": "Psilocybin is a hallucinogenic compound found in about 200 mushroom species, including the liberty cap (Psilocybe semilanceata). For millennia, our ancestors have known and used this substance, and in recent years, it has received renewed interest from scientific researchers and therapists.          The substance has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat conditions such as severe depression and substance addiction, according to many. This is also the opinion of University of Southern Denmark researchers Himanshu Khandelia and Ali Asghar Hakami Zanjani from the Department of Physics, Chemistry and Pharmacy.The two researchers have recently published their paper, titled \"The Molecular Basis of the Antidepressant Action of the Magic Mushroom extract, Psilocin.\" The article is the third in a series on the same topic from the two researchers (Interaction of psychedelic tryptamine derivatives with a lipid bilayer and Magic mushroom extracts in lipid membranes). The newest study's co-authors are Teresa Quynh Tram Nguyen and Luise Jacobsen.\"My interest was piqued when I heard a podcast about treating smoking addiction with psilocybin. And since psilocybin mushrooms grow everywhere in Denmark\u2014I picked some in Svanninge Bakker\u2014it wasn't difficult to start our research,\" said Himanshu Khandelia.Together with Ali Asghar Hakami Zanjani, he is interested in understanding what happens at the molecular level when psilocybin enters the body, is converted to psilocin, and reaches the brain.\"Previous research has shown that psilocin binds to serotonin receptors in the brain. We show that psilocin binds stronger than serotonin to a 5-HT2AR serotonin receptor. This knowledge can be used if you want to design a drug that acts like psilocybin,\" explained Ali Asghar Hakami Zanjani.The two researchers are neither neuroscientists nor pharmacists, so they currently have no plans on conducting clinical trials or designing new drugs. Their research is about studying and describing what happens at the molecular level when psilocin meets a brain cell, penetrates its membrane, and binds to receptors.      \"I would be very happy if society can use our research. Maybe someone will take this further and create a molecule that can be used in medical treatment for conditions like depression,\" says Himanshu Khandelia.Zanjani and Khandelia plan to continue their research in this area, and are now investigating the mechanism by which the binding of the compounds to the receptor triggers psycho-active responses.The time is more favorable than it has been in a long time for researchers who want to explore psilocybin treatments for conditions such as depression, addiction, anorexia, and PTSD.Since the 1960s, many countries' health authorities have had strict bans on researching hallucinogenic substances like psilocybin and LSD.Prior to that, Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman had isolated psilocybin and psilocin from the P. mexicana mushroom in 1959, and the pharmaceutical company he worked for marketed and sold pure psilocybin to doctors and therapists who could then treat their patients with it.Towards the end of the 1960s, many countries, especially the United States, tightened their legislation on psychoactive substances, and this also affected research on psilocybin and similar substances, which has been largely stagnant since the 1960s until a few years ago.Today, countries like the United States, England, and Denmark are again active in the research field\u2014now with a more cautious approach.Hallucinations and the feeling of being disconnected from the world will come along whether one eats a psilocybin mushroom to take a trip or one takes the substance in a medically prescribed tablet, and this calls for caution, explains Ali Asghar Hakami Zanjani:\"Research shows that you experience something different. It is a form of hallucination. The characteristic is that patients may get a whole new perspective on their situation: for example, a terminally ill cancer patient may lose their fear of dying soon and instead experience acceptance of their life situation. Such sessions should take place in safe and guiding settings led by trained therapists. Today, no one would recommend just eating some mushrooms at home in their own living room.\"The paper is published in the journal Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)\u2014Proteins and Proteomics.

  "text": "Inexpensive new materials and sensors will help even small museums prevent irreversible damage to objects.          Overlooking the waters of the Grand Canal in Venice, the former home of American art collector Peggy Guggenheim houses one of Italy's most important collections of 20th century works. Until recently, many of them were at risk from an invisible attacker: acetic acid released by their aging wooden picture frames.Chemists based in another renowned Italian city, Florence, have come up with a new material that will protect the artworks from acetic acid, formaldehyde and other damaging volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for between 50 and 100 years.Clever and cheap\"We synthesized the first absorber for acetic acid and formaldehyde using a very clever, cheap method,\" said Piero Baglioni, professor of physical chemistry at the Center for Colloid and Surface Science, or CSGI, in the University of Florence.The material is flexible and biodegradable and can absorb twice its weight in pollutants. It's made mainly from castor oil.Curators at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection have applied sheets of it to the backs of paintings and on a wall in one room, which includes a 1929 painting by Vasily Kandinsky and a 1915 sculpture by Umberto Boccioni.Levels of acetic acid in the room have since dropped from two parts per million (ppm), which is high enough to damage artwork, to safe levels of 0.5 ppm, according to Baglioni.The material, Nanorestore VOCs, can be produced in any shape, size and color, said Baglioni, who coordinated a research project called APACHE that developed a range of products designed to protect valuable artworks.The discovery is likely to have a major impact on the future health of artworks, including those in storage. That's because many galleries and museums store their collections in wooden containers, which release VOCs.The Pompidou Center in Paris\u2014home to Europe's largest collection of modern and contemporary art\u2014is testing the material for its storage containers. The museum keeps most of its 120,000 pieces in wooden crates, including works by Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Georges Braque.      Scream testBaglioni is also testing the material in the Oslo, Norway-based museum dedicated to Edvard Munch and featuring one of the artist's most famous paintings\u2014The Scream. Hundreds of Munch's prints and drawings are kept in wooden drawers that would cost a small fortune to change to a new material, according to Baglioni.In February, following APACHE's end last year, his team put sheets of the material\u2014costing about \u20ac5 each\u2014in the storage drawers and will check the VOC levels in June.\"If it works, the museum will save a lot of money,\" Baglioni said.The product will soon be on the market for museums and galleries. It's also being marketed as a way to purify the air in homes, hospitals and offices. VOCs comprise 80% of indoor air pollutants and can affect people's health.Baglioni is working with researchers at Sweden's Chalmers University to produce what they hope will be the world's most effective and environmentally friendly material for absorbing VOCs.APACHE also developed sensors that cost just \u20ac0.10 each to monitor levels of VOCs. These will be made by Goppion, an Italian company that produces display cases used by the Louvre and other cultural institutions.But the company, which took part in the project, needs broader demand for production to be viable.\"If the market for this system is restricted to museums and galleries, it won't be profitable,\" said Baglioni. \"So we have to find an additional use for them.\"Invisible threatsMost threats to Europe's masterpieces and historical artifacts are invisible to the naked eye: changes in temperature or humidity, ultraviolet light, small vibrations from the footfall of visitors or building works as well as VOCs.Even the type of building that the works are housed in\u2014modern or old, stone or wooden\u2014affects them. Often, the impacts become visible only once the damage is done.Whereas large museums and art galleries can pay for multiple sensors to monitor closely their collections, cash-strapped smaller institutions struggle to meet international standards on maintenance and storage.\"It's really hard for small and medium-sized museums to preserve their artifacts because of a lack of expertise, human resources and means,\" said Marie-Dominique Bruni, program manager at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, also known as CEA.Bruni coordinated a project called SensMat that developed sensors and software to monitor as many as 12 different environmental factors\u2014from dust levels to vibrations\u2014and alert conservators to the risks to art in their care so they can act before damage occurs.\"We facilitate the way they collect and interpret this data to decide the best way to display an exhibit, or what to change if its environment puts it at risk of damage,\" said Bruni.That may mean changing the climate controls, limiting the number of visitors or moving the item to another room.Metal objects, for example, can corrode in the wrong temperature, humidity and light conditions.\"When that corrosion becomes visible, it's too late,\" said Bruni. \"So we have to move the objects or change the temperature and humidity to prevent their corrosion.\"One of the most detrimental effects is low-frequency vibration. These could come not just from visitors' footfall and building works but also auto traffic.\"Museums need to diagnose the impact of vibrations,\" said Bruni. \"Frescoes painted on walls or ceilings and objects made with different layers are particularly vulnerable.\"Software successMuseums and galleries increasingly lend collections to each other, a practice that creates new challenges for the transport and display of objects.\"Museums and galleries have to guarantee they won't endanger the objects they are receiving,\" said Bruni. \"Our software could help them define the conditions needed before receiving new objects. Insurance companies are very interested in this kind of information.\"SensMat, which ran from January 2019 through August 2022, worked with museums in seven European countries including Denmark, France, Germany and Italy.\"It was really important to have studies in different climates and different locations,\" said Bruni.This meant being able to develop solutions suited to a wide range of scenarios. The SensMat team hopes its findings will be used to help update international recommendations on how to display and preserve objects.Today Bruni is trying to find investors in order to complete the last stage of development and put the software on the market.Large museums have expressed interest in the software, but making it affordable for small galleries is the ultimate goal.\"We've received lots of demand for the software,\" Bruni said. \"We just need to develop it a little bit more.

  "text": "A method to store advanced cell models has been developed by researchers at the University of Warwick.          The technology, which was shared in the journal JACS Au, could improve the cryopreservation of cells, tissue culture and 3D cells models used variety of applications, including research, medical therapies and agriculture.Cryopreservation is the process of freezing cells at very low temperatures to preserve them for later use. However, when cells are frozen, ice can form inside the cells, which can damage or kill them. This is a particular problem for 2D and 3D cellular models, which replicate some of the properties of organs and have complex structures that make it difficult for cryoprotectants to reach all their constituent cells.The new method developed by the researchers at the University of Warwick uses soluble ice nucleating polysaccharides (a type of molecule that interacts with ice) produced by tree pollens to ensure ice forms outside of cells. This helps prevent the formation of damaging ice in cell interiors. The method was tested on a variety of 2D and 3D tissue models and was found to be effective in reducing intracellular ice formation and improving cell viability.The work has particular importance because of a recent decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, removing the requirement to test new drugs on animals and expanding the need for methods for storing and transporting organ-like cell models.Dr. Thomas Whale, Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick, said, \"Cryopreservation is essential across all biomedical research and drug discovery. Most people assume cryopreservation is focused on stopping ice forming, but it is actually essential to help ice form, at the highest temperature possible. We achieved this, and show that by helping the ice form we can dramatically improve the recovery of these cells.\"Professor Matthew Gibson, Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, added, \"This innovative work has been inspired by nature, which has evolved elegant solutions to control exactly when, and where ice forms. Our discovery shows that we can store complex cell models in a freezer, so they are 'ready to use,' to advance basic biomedical research. Another advance is that wider available of complex cell models may reduce the need for animal testing in the drug development process.\" More information:Kathryn A.

  "text": "A Cornell-led collaboration harnessed chemical reactions to make microscale origami machines self-fold\u2014freeing them from the liquids in which they usually function, so they can operate in dry environments and at room temperature.          The approach could one day lead to the creation of a new fleet of tiny autonomous devices that can rapidly respond to their chemical environment.The group's paper, \"Gas-Phase Microactuation Using Kinetically Controlled Surface States of Ultrathin Catalytic Sheets,\" published May 1 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper's co-lead authors are Nanqi Bao, Ph.D. '22, and former postdoctoral researcher Qingkun Liu, Ph.D. '22.The project was led by senior author Nicholas Abbott, a Tisch University Professor in the Robert F. Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in Cornell Engineering, along with Itai Cohen, professor of physics, and Paul McEuen, the John A. Newman Professor of Physical Science, both in the College of Arts and Sciences; and David Muller, the Samuel B. Eckert Professor of Engineering in Cornell Engineering.\"There are quite good technologies for electrical to mechanical energy transduction, such as the electric motor, and the McEuen and Cohen groups have shown a strategy for doing that on the microscale, with their robots,\" Abbott said. \"But if you look for direct chemical to mechanical transductions, actually there are very few options.\"Reversible actuation of a SCA during cycles of exposure to a O2-H2 mixture (10:1) and H2 at room temperature (real time). Credit: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023). DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2221740120Prior efforts depended on chemical reactions that could only occur in extreme conditions, such as at high temperatures of several 100 degrees Celsius, and the reactions were often tediously slow\u2014sometimes as long as 10 minutes\u2014making the approach impractical for everyday technological applications.However, Abbott's group found a loophole of sorts while reviewing data from a catalysis experiment: a small section of the chemical reaction pathway contained both slow and fast steps.\"If you look at the response of the chemical actuator, it's not that it goes from one state directly to the other state. It actually goes through an excursion into a bent state, a curvature, which is more extreme than either of the two end states,\" Abbott said. \"If you understand the elementary reaction steps in a catalytic pathway, you can go in and sort of surgically extract out the rapid steps. You can operate your chemical actuator around those rapid steps, and just ignore the rest of it.\"      The researchers needed the right material platform to leverage that rapid kinetic moment, so they turned to McEuen and Cohen, who had worked with Muller to develop ultrathin platinum sheets capped with titanium.The group also collaborated with theorists, led by professor Manos Mavrikakis at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who used electronic structure calculations to dissect the chemical reaction that occurs when hydrogen\u2014adsorbed to the material\u2014is exposed to oxygen.The researchers were then able to exploit the crucial moment that the oxygen quickly strips the hydrogen, causing the atomically thin material to deform and bend, like a hinge.The system actuates at 600 milliseconds per cycle and can operate at 20 degrees Celsius\u2014i.e., room temperature\u2014in dry environments.\"The result is quite generalizable,\" Abbott said. \"There are a lot of catalytic reactions which have been developed based on all sorts of species. So carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia: they're all candidates to use as fuels for chemically driven actuators.\"The team anticipates applying the technique to other catalytic metals, such as palladium and palladium gold alloys. Eventually this work could lead to autonomous material systems in which the controlling circuitry and onboard computation are handled by the material's response\u2014for example, an autonomous chemical system that regulates flows based on chemical composition.\"We are really excited because this work paves the way to microscale origami machines that work in gaseous environments,\" Cohen said.

  "text": "Achieving sustainability goals will require the use of feedstocks such as plastics and biomass instead of oil. Moreover, industries are constantly searching for more efficient and sustainable processes, which often require precise simulations. In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, determining the energy of molecules adsorbed on surfaces is crucial to estimate catalyst performance, which is typically done using density functional theory (DFT). However, for large organic molecules like those in plastics and biomass, this cannot be done.          To address this issue, scientists from the Prof. L\u00f3pez research group at the Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia (ICIQ-CERCA) in collaboration with researchers from The Matter Lab (University of Toronto), have created a new model called GAME-Net, a graph neural network that rapidly evaluates adsorption energy when molecules attach to surfaces. Their research is published in the journal Nature Computational Science.Trained on a diverse dataset of small and medium-sized molecules containing functional groups, GAME-Net achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17 eV on the test set and is six orders of magnitude faster than DFT. When applied to biomass (wood) and plastic molecules with up to 30 atoms, the model predicts adsorption energies with a MAE of 0.016 eV/atom.GAME-Net is capable of estimating adsorption energy with an accuracy comparable to DFT, while utilizing a simple molecular representation. This breakthrough model opens up the possibility of predicting adsorption energy for larger molecules derived from biomass, polyurethanes, and plastics, enabling the study of chemical systems that are not easily amenable to DFT calculations. This revolutionary technology can be easily run on a laptop, making it accessible to scientists and researchers around the world.\"For us, this work represents a starting point for the practical implementation of Machine Learning algorithms for quantum chemistry in the typical workflow of both, experimental and computational, researchers in heterogenous catalysis. Even though GAME-Net presents some limitations, its speed, coupled with the simplicity in its structure, and the way of interfacing it, makes this model a valuable tool for the community,\" states Santiago Morandi from ICIQ.Let's 'KISS': Keep it small and simpleThe growing popularity of artificial intelligence has led to numerous attempts to improve its predictive capabilities. Among them are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a type of neural networks capable of learning the \"shape\" of data.The algorithm proposed by the researchers employs a simple graph representation where nodes correspond to atoms and edges represent chemical bonds. In order to predict the energy change when a catalyst interacts with a reactant molecule, a graph neural network is used, when typically, this change is obtained from DFT.      GAME-Net was trained on a diverse set of small molecules containing different heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. To initiate the process, researchers created the \"functional groups\" (FG)-dataset from scratch, which comprises 207 organic molecules adsorbed on 14 transition metals (Ag, Au, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, and Zn) on their lowest surface energy facets.To assure high reproducibility standards all the computational data generated in this study is accessible from the ioChem-BD repository. The code of the GAME-Net, together with the pre-trained model, have been released as open-source under the MIT license and can be downloaded from a repository.\"With this work we wanted to see if we were able to teach complex chemical interactions to an AI using the chemical representations we teach kids in high school. Surprisingly, our AI turned out to be an excellent student,\" says Dr. Pablo-Garc\u00eda Ph.D. student at ICIQ now at the University of Toronto.This innovative AI framework offers a powerful tool for quick screening of catalytic materials, especially for systems that are too challenging to simulate using traditional methods. Chemical industries can benefit from the integration of artificial intelligence in their research, to accelerate the understanding and design of heterogeneous catalysts for the development of more sustainable processes. GAME-Net is open to new and exciting improvements, such as specific reaction steps and, as well, more complex catalyst materials.\"Beyond the short-term impact our work may have, our model demonstrates that AIs are capable of describing complex chemical interactions using extremely simple models, making them more accessible to scientists who want to accelerate their research,\" conclude Dr. Pablo-Garc\u00eda and Santiago Morandi.

  "text": "Scientists have developed two new drug candidates for potentially treating addiction and depression, modeled on the pharmacology of a traditional African psychedelic plant medicine called ibogaine. At very low doses, these new compounds were able to blunt symptoms of both conditions in mice.          The findings, published May 2 in Cell, took inspiration from ibogaine's impact on the serotonin transporter (SERT), which is also the target of SSRI antidepressants like fluoxetine (Prozac). A team of scientists from UCSF, Yale and Duke universities virtually screened 200 million molecular structures to find ones that blocked SERT in the same way as ibogaine.\"Some people swear by ibogaine for treating addiction, but it isn't a very good drug. It has bad side effects, and it's not approved for use in the U.S.,\" said Brian Shoichet, Ph.D., co-senior author and professor in the UCSF School of Pharmacy. \"Our compounds mimic just one of ibogaine's many pharmacological effects, and still replicate its most desirable effects on behavior, at least in mice.\"Dozens of scientists from the laboratories of Shoichet, Allan Basbaum, Ph.D., and Aashish Manglik, MD, Ph.D., (UCSF); Gary Rudnick, Ph.D., (Yale); and Bill Wetsel, Ph.D., (Duke) helped demonstrate the real-world promise of these novel molecules, which were initially identified using Shoichet's computational docking methods.Docking involves systematically testing virtual chemical structures for binding with a protein, enabling scientists to identify new drug leads without having to synthesize them in the lab.\"This kind of project begins with visualizing what kinds of molecules will fit into a protein, docking the library, optimizing, and then relying on a team to show the molecules work,\" said Isha Singh, Ph.D., a co-first author of the paper who did the work as a postdoc in Shoichet's lab. \"Now we know there's a lot of untapped therapeutic potential in targeting SERT.\"Ibogaine is found in the roots of the iboga plant, which is native to central Africa, and has been used for millennia during shamanistic rituals. In the 19th and 20th centuries, doctors in Europe and the U.S. experimented with its use in treating a variety of ailments, but the drug never gained widespread acceptance and was ultimately made illegal in many countries.      Part of the problem, Shoichet explained, is that ibogaine interferes with many aspects of human biology.\"Ibogaine binds to hERG, which can cause heart arrhythmias, and from a scientific standpoint, it's a 'dirty' drug, binding to lots of targets beyond SERT,\" Shoichet said. \"Before this experiment, we didn't even know if the benefits of ibogaine came from its binding to SERT.\"Shoichet, who has used docking on brain receptors to identify drugs to treat depression and pain, became interested in SERT and ibogaine after Rudnick, an expert on SERT at Yale, spent a sabbatical in his lab. Singh picked up the project in 2018, hoping to turn the buzz around ibogaine into a better understanding of SERT.It was the Shoichet lab's first docking experiment on a transporter\u2014a protein that moves molecules into and out of cells\u2014rather than a receptor. One round of docking whittled the virtual library from 200 million to just 49 molecules, 36 of which could be synthesized. Rudnick's lab tested them and found that 13 inhibited SERT.The team then held virtual-reality-guided \"docking parties,\" to help Singh prioritize five molecules for optimization. The two most potent SERT inhibitors were shared with Basbaum and Wetsel's teams for rigorous testing on animal models of addiction, depression, and anxiety.\"All of a sudden, they popped\u2014that's when these drugs looked a lot more potent than even paroxetine [Paxil],\" Shoichet said.Manglik, an expert with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), confirmed that one of the two drugs, dubbed '8090, fit into SERT at the atomic level in a way that closely resembled Singh and Shoichet's computational predictions. The drugs inhibited SERT in a similar way to ibogaine, but unlike the psychedelic, their effect was potent and selective, with no spillover impacts on a panel of hundreds of other receptors and transporters.\"With this sort of potency, we hope to have a better therapeutic window without side effects,\" Basbaum said. \"Dropping the dose almost 200-fold could make a big difference for patients.Shoichet has submitted the structures of both new molecules to Sigma Aldrich, the chemical manufacturing company, aiming to make the them available for further testing by other scientists, while he continues to hunt for more precise moleculesWith millions of patients continuing to suffer from depression or addiction, new prospective therapies are needed.\"This is really the way science should be done,\" Basbaum said. \"We took a group with expertise in disparate fields and came up with something that might really make a difference.\" More information:Brian K.

  "text": "Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) have developed a method to synthesize the highly potent antimalarial drug artemisinin, which could lead to a more cost-effective treatment for malaria.          The work was recently featured on the cover of the journal Organic Letters.In 2021, 247 million cases of malaria led to 619,000 deaths worldwide. The most effective malaria treatments utilize the drug artemisinin, which is derived from the sweet wormwood plant, Artemisia annua. However, the process of isolating artemisinin from the plant is time-consuming, and crop yields are susceptible to weather patterns, insect pests and other factors. Despite scientific advancements in treatment methods, the cost of artemisinin still burdens the countries most affected by malaria.\"We were able to develop a novel way of synthesizing artemisinin that mimics how it's made in nature,\" SwRI Senior Research Scientist Dr. Shawn Blumberg said. \"Our method mimics the biosynthetic pathway of how artemisinin is made in the plant where it originates, Artemisia annua. We studied the intermediate compounds along that pathway and then used chemistry to create those same intermediates and recreate the pathway.\"\"There was nothing in public scientific literature that suggested this would work,\" Frantz said. \"This was challenging chemistry that we were trying to pull off, but we let science tell us where to go. It enabled us to design a process of taking a common intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway for artemisinin and converting it all the way to Artemisinic acid, which is the direct precursor to artemisinin.\"Blumberg and Frantz hope drug companies will take advantage of their work and offer a more potent and cost-effective malaria treatment to the impoverished countries that need it the most, especially considering the inherent risks of drought, wildfire and insects that come with depending on a plant that can only grow in certain parts of the world.\"The supply of artemisinin is still kind of erratic, which causes prices to be erratic as well, and countries dealing with this endemic need a stable, cost-effective solution,\" Blumberg said. \"While the new process we've created might not completely supplant current methods, it can complement other approaches and help to stabilize the world's supply of artemisinin.\" More information:Nicholas A.

  "answer_squad": " headspace",
  "text": "While adding a little water is popularly thought to \"open up\" the flavor of whisky, a Washington State University-led study indicates there's a point at which it becomes too much: about 20%.          Researchers chemically analyzed how volatile compounds in a set of 25 whiskies responded to the addition of water, including bourbons, ryes, Irish whiskeys and both single malt and blended Scotches. They also had a trained sensory panel assess six of those whiskies, three Scotches and three bourbons.Both tests found that adding a little water could change how the whiskies smelled, but after 20%, they may start to have the same aroma. Since smell and taste are often closely linked, this likely affected the spirit's flavor as well.\"If you want to enjoy a specific whisky, this suggests that you don't want to dilute it by more than about 20%,\" said Tom Collins, a WSU assistant professor and senior author on the study in the journal Foods. \"By the time you get to 60/40 whisky to water, the whiskies are not differentiated by the panelists; they begin to smell the same, and that's not really what you're looking for.\"Working with Elizabeth Tomasino at Oregon State University to run the sensory panel, the researchers found that at 100% whisky, the panelists could easily tell all the whiskies apart from each other. At 80/20 whisky to water, they could still differentiate whiskies within each group, but after more water was added, that changed.While within each style of whisky the aromas became more similar, the larger grouping of Scotches, both single malts and blended, remained distinct from the American bourbons and ryes.The chemical analysis revealed similar results showing the changes in volatile compounds that entered the \"headspace,\" or the area above the liquid, when water was added.Whisky is a mix of compounds that run the scale from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, in other words, ones that are attracted to water and others that are repelled by it. The addition of water sends the whisky's hydrophobic compounds into that headspace and leaves the hydrophilic ones behind, changing the aroma of the liquid.The researchers found that the chemical analysis matched the impressions of the educated panel. For instance, many of the Scotch whiskies started out with a smoky, \"peat\" aroma, but as they were diluted, they moved toward a fruitier aroma known as \"pome.\"\"This happens because of the way dilution affects what's in the headspace,\" said Collins. \"The compounds that are associated with smoky aromas dissipate, and they were replaced by compounds that are associated with fruity aromas.\"Likewise, the American bourbons were mostly associated with vanilla and oak scents at first, but as more water was added, they took on more aromas of the corn and grains used to make them.The findings can help whisky makers better understand how their customers will experience the drink if they chose to add water or have it \"on the rocks.\"It also gives some backing to the practice of serving whisky with a single, large ice cube.\"This study helps to understand why those large, square ice cubes have become so popular because you can actually enjoy the whisky before it gets diluted to the point that it's not the same whisky,\" said Collins.Collins and his colleagues are currently further investigating the compounds that give Scotch whiskies their smoky aroma. They plan to present that ongoing work as well as this study at the Worldwide Distilled Spirits Conference in Edinburgh, Scotland taking place May 9-11.In addition to Collins and Tomasino, co-authors on this study include Aubrey DuBois of Michigan State University as well as first author P. Layton Ashmore and James Harbertson of WSU. More information:P. Layton Ashmore et al, Impact of Dilution on Whisky Aroma: A Sensory and Volatile Composition Analysis, Foods (2023).

  "answer_squad": " National University of Singapore",
  "text": "A research team from the National University of Singapore (NUS) has successfully used common plant proteins to 3D-print an edible cell culture scaffold, allowing more affordable and sustainable lab-grown meat to be served on the table.          As consumers become more conscious of the environmental and ethical ramifications of their food, lab-grown meat, also known as cultured meat or cell-based meat, is becoming an increasingly popular source of dietary protein. Cultured meat is produced by taking skeletal muscle cells from animals and growing them on three-dimensional constructs called scaffolds, which provide structural support as the cells multiply and develop into tissues.However, cell culture scaffolds are typically made from synthetic or animal-based materials, which are either too expensive or inedible. In search of an alternative, the team led by Professor Huang Dejian, Deputy Head of the NUS Department of Food Science and Technology, turned to plant proteins, which are known to be biodegradable and biocompatible with animal cells. Crucially, plant proteins also satisfy common requirements for food consumption, making the resulting scaffold fit for culturing meat.\"By using readily available cereal prolamins as biomaterials for high-precision 3D printing technology, we open up a new method for manufacturing edible and structured scaffolds to produce cultured muscle meat slices with fibrous qualities,\" said Prof Huang.The team's work, in line with NUS' thrust to produce cutting-edge sustainability research, was published in the journal Advanced Materials.The making of an edible scaffoldProlamins are a family of plant storage proteins that, due to their specific amino acid profile, have low nutritional value. In fact, prolamins are generated as waste in the starch and vegetable oil industries. Nevertheless, Prof Huang and his team leveraged these characteristics of prolamins to come up with an affordable and sustainable resource for meat culture.Specifically, the researchers used mixtures of prolamins derived from corn, barley and rye flour, also known as zeins, hordeins and secalins, respectively. These mixtures then acted as the ink for electrohydrodynamic printing, a high-precision 3D printing technology commonly employed in biomedical applications.To assess whether the prolamin constructs were fit for meat cultivation, they were submerged in the cell culture medium and inspected seven days later to examine any structural changes. Under a scanning electron microscope, the scaffolds held their structure and did not collapse, though multiple holes did develop on their surfaces. According to the researchers, however, these pores are more likely the result of enzymes secreted by the cultured cells rather than evidence of structural weaknesses.For scaffolds to be of any use in cultivating meat, they need to be biocompatible with muscle cells from agricultural animals, meaning that they need to be able to accommodate these cells and support their growth and development.To test this, Prof Huang and team seeded the prolamin constructs with stem cells from pig skeletal muscle and measured cell proliferation over the following days. They found that the cells divided extensively on the scaffolds, reaching a maximum count 11 days after they were inoculated. The stem cells grew comparably well in both zein/hordein and zein/secalin scaffolds.Of significance, when compared against a standard polycaprolactone scaffold, a common tool in tissue engineering, pig cells seeded onto the prolamin constructs proliferated much faster, demonstrating that the plant protein-based scaffold was more feasible for cultured meat production than standard synthetic polymers.\"Scaffolds made from plant proteins are edible and have diverse and variable peptide sequences that can facilitate cell attachment, induce differentiation, and speed up the growth of meat. In contrast, synthetic scaffolds such as plastic beads used for cultured meat have no functional group which makes it difficult for animal cells to attach and proliferate. In addition, synthetic scaffolds are not edible and extra steps are required to separate the scaffolds from the meat culture,\" elaborated Prof Huang.As a proof of-concept, the research team tried to produce an actual slice of meat by culturing pig skin stem cells on a zein/secalin scaffold, and then allowed them to differentiate, or mature, into muscle. Beet extract was used to simulate meat's reddish color.Their experiment turned out to be a success. Within 12 days, the research team was able to culture meat that was similar in texture and overall appearance to real animal meat.\"Since the scaffold was edible, no special or additional procedures were needed to extract it from the final product,\" shares Prof Huang. These results further verify the potential of the proposed prolamin-based scaffolds in cultivated meat production.\"      Further developmentsProf Huang and his team are actively working on refining the plant protein-based technology. For instance, more studies are needed to better determine how the particular structure and composition of the prolamin constructs might impact the growth of animal stem cells and how they form muscle tissue.\"Moreover, we need to ensure the resulting meat products are market-ready, with safety profiles that will satisfy rigorous regulatory demands and nutritional compositions that will fulfill recommended dietary needs,\" says Prof Huang. \"Of course, they need to be appetizing, too. Flavor, aroma and texture need to be carefully calibrated to compete with traditionally farmed meat products.\" More information:Lingshan Su et al, 3D\u2010Printed Prolamin Scaffolds for Cell\u2010Based Meat Culture, Advanced Materials (2022).

  "answer_squad": " per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances",
  "text": "A firefighter's protective clothing, called turnout gear, is essential for operating in the dangerous conditions of a fire. However, the firefighting community has raised concerns regarding the presence of a class of chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\u2014some of which have been linked to cancer\u2014in the gear.          Until recently, the public has had little information regarding the specific types, quantities and location of PFAS in firefighter equipment, but now, a new report sheds light.Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have conducted an in-depth examination of a range of textiles used in turnout gear coats and pants, which are constructed in three layers. The results showed that the amount of PFAS present varies widely between manufacturers and layers, with the highest PFAS concentrations observed in the outermost two. The results of the study suggest that selecting optimal combinations of fabrics for each layer could significantly reduce the amount of PFAS present in turnout gear.PFAS, which are ubiquitous in manufactured products due to their oil- and water-resistant properties, do not break down easily and persist in our bodies and the environment, earning them the moniker of \"forever chemicals.\" These suspected carcinogens have found their way into the bodies of most Americans. However, researchers have shown that firefighters are burdened by comparatively high levels of at least one type of PFAS.The first step to better protecting firefighters from this potential health hazard is to learn about the sources of PFAS exposure, which may include their protective gear.\"At NIST, we're trying to figure out what is in there. How much? What type?\" said NIST researcher Rick Davis, a study co-author. \"Once we answer that, then researchers can start to answer questions about how it's getting into firefighters' systems. Do they inhale it? Do they ingest it? Does it pass through their skin?\"The research team collected 20 brand-new textile samples, each used for one of the three layers of turnout gear\u2014the outer shell, the moisture barrier and the thermal liner. All meet a standard published by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), which specifies requirements for resisting heat, water and other hazards.For the researchers, quantifying the concentration of any other chemical would have likely been standard fare, but PFAS brought forth unique challenges. Contamination is almost always a concern in chemical analysis, as chemicals from outside the sample can skew results. In this study, the authors encountered external sources of PFAS at nearly every turn.      \"It was a big challenge. Most of our analytical equipment contains fluoropolymers that could leach out PFAS. But over the years, we've developed ways to reduce contamination,\" said NIST researcher and study co-author John Kucklick. \"In some cases, there was contamination, but we were able to identify and flag it.\"The researchers relied heavily on existing PFAS standards\u2014highly accurate and pure PFAS samples of a known concentration\u2014to ensure that the methods they used to measure PFAS levels produced accurate results. The team also employed several measurement techniques in parallel to further ensure their findings could be trusted.The researchers targeted 53 PFAS within 20 textiles used to fabricate the different layers of turnout gear. They identified and quantified the concentrations of 26 different PFAS, uncovering some important differences among the samples.The team found the least amount of PFAS in the layer closest to firefighters' skin, the thermal lining, which may correspond to water repellency being a lower priority for this layer than the other two.At the other end of the spectrum, the moisture barrier and the outer shell contained PFAS concentrations up to 400 times higher, though those numbers varied widely from fabric to fabric.Two of the outer shell textiles they tested had not been treated with a water repellant coating. Those samples contained far less PFAS than other outer shell layers, while the treated outer shell fabric consistently contained the greatest amounts of PFAS.\"If you changed to a non-PFAS water repellant coating on the outer shell, then you essentially eliminate PFAS from that layer. There isn't much in the thermal liner to begin with. So really the one layer left to address is the moisture barrier,\" Davis said. \"On paper this sounds easy to solve\u2014just use a non-PFAS based water repellent\u2014but we need to know we aren't just swapping out one risk for another.\"Ongoing work at NIST is aiming to unveil the effects that wear and tear\u2014UV exposure, heat, laundering, etc.\u2014have on measurable PFAS in turnout gear. The researchers suspect that regular use may lead more PFAS to escape from the gear.The results of that research should further cement our understanding of what is inside the gear. NIST is also completing a similar study of PFAS in new and stressed hoods, gloves and wildland gear.Additionally, NIST has started planning research to study fire scenes, fire stations and other occupational environments firefighters work in.\"While we are starting to understand PFAS in the firefighter gear, we don't know to what extent firefighters may be exposed to PFAS from their workplace,\" Davis said. \"Understanding what PFAS are in the workplace tells a more complete story of the firefighter's exposure.\"Further research by federal partners will focus on what kinds and levels of PFAS are dangerous and how the chemicals find their way into firefighters' bodies.Together, that information could be used to update turnout equipment standards and give firefighters confidence that the equipment meant to have their backs is not turning on them.The research was published by NIST.

  "text": "In an effort to make textiles more sustainable, a new method allows researchers to break old clothing down chemically and reuse polyester compounds to create fire resistant, anti-bacterial or wrinkle-free coatings that could then be applied to clothes and fabrics.          The proof-of-principle study provides hope for unsustainable textile, apparel and footwear industries that together generate 20% of global solid waste. Many so-called recyclers end up illegally dumping textiles as trash in countries in Asia and Africa.\"We think that our clothes are recycled or reprocessed, but most of the time they are actually sent to other places as solid waste,\" said Juan Hinestroza, the Rebecca Q. Morgan '60 Professor of Fiber Science & Apparel Design and director of the Textiles Nanotechnology Laboratory in the College of Human Ecology. \"Our main goal is to offer a pathway to reuse this material.\"The paper, \"Upcycling of Dyed Polyester Fabrics into Copper-1, 4-Benzeedicarboxylate Metal-Organic Frameworks,\" published March 30 in the journal Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, describes the process of cutting textiles into pieces and chemically decomposing them into a soup of raw materials, dyes, additives, dirt and esters. A metal solution is added and building blocks from the polyester share an affinity with the metal, and selectively link together metal compounds forming tiny cages (called metal-organic frameworks) that settle to the bottom of the soup.The cages that form are then used to make coatings, which may require minor structural tweaks to tailor each to specific uses. These might include coatings that make permanent press shirts that don't wrinkle, antibacterial surgical gowns or scrubs, or baby or industrial clothes that require a fire-retardant protection.\"One goal of my lab is to create a universal coating that will serve all these purposes, though we are still far away from that,\" Hinestroza said.Yelin Ko, a doctoral student in the field of human centered design, is the paper's first author. Prior to this research, some believed the dyes and impurities in the mix would interfere with the process, but this proof-of-principle of the method\u2014known as controlled crystallization\u2014shows that the polyester-derived linkers can seek out and attach to metal compounds in solution, in spite of other present materials.The research describes a closed loop process, where discarded materials may be reused and contribute to a circular economy\u2014a focus for many sustainability researchers at Cornell, Hinestroza said.

  "text": "Different market products give very different results when it comes to liberating the antioxidant lutein from spinach in smoothies. Researchers at Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden, have examined 14 common dairy and plant-based products and found that only four of these increased lutein liberation. Compared to water, some drinks had a negative effect on the lutein content in spinach smoothies.          Most people know that spinach is good for your health. One substance found in, for instance, spinach and kale is lutein. Several experimental studies have shown that lutein can suppress processes linked to inflammation, and there is now ample research indicating that chronic low-grade inflammation is an important risk factor in cardiovascular disease.\"Lutein is a bio-active compound. We have studied lutein in a similar way to studying a pharmaceutical drug. In this study, we looked at lutein liberation from fresh spinach,\" says Rosanna Chung, assistant professor in the Department of Health, Medicine and Caring Sciences at Link\u00f6ping University, who led the study published in Nutrients.As our bodies cannot produce lutein, the researchers behind the study were interested to find out how to optimize lutein intake from foods. The research group previously showed that preparation methods where the spinach is heated break down some of the lutein, whereas mixing it into a smoothie makes more lutein available for absorption.The type of liquid used in the smoothie can also affect lutein content. As lutein dissolves in fat but not in water, it needs gastric juice and/or other food components to be liberated from the plant material and absorbed by our intestines. The researchers suspected that some components in our food, such as fat, carbohydrates, proteins and fibers, can affect the amount of lutein available for absorption. The effect of products such as yogurt may also differ due to fermentation. However, products widely available on the market are rarely examined in scientific studies.The researchers have examined the effects of various products available from food shops on the amount of lutein liberated in smoothies. Both dairy and plant-based liquids were tested.The researchers blended spinach with the various products. They then used a method simulating human digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, by adding digestive enzymes. Finally, the amount of lutein available for the body to absorb in smoothies made with various products was compared to that in smoothies made with just water.\"We could see that only four of the 14 examined products increased the liberation of lutein from spinach compared to water. Cow's milk with a high fat content as well as coconut milk improved lutein liberation. Yogurt, however, which is regarded as comparable to cow's milk and is often used in caf\u00e9s and similar, did not show particularly good results,\" says Rosanna Chung.The fact that yogurt is not that good at liberating lutein may have to do with the fermentation process. It also turned out that plant-based drinks, often made from nuts, legumes or oats, showed significantly different results.\"Plant-based liquids have become increasingly common in smoothies. We saw that soymilk was actually less effective than water when it comes to liberating lutein in spinach smoothies. In other words, soymilk had a negative effect on lutein liberation in our study,\" says Jan Neelissen, doctorate student and one of the researchers behind the study.The other plant-based products in the study did not affect lutein liberation compared to water. As a general piece of information, smoothies should be consumed as soon as possible, because lutein breaks down quickly.It is important to note that whereas the results from this study indicate how much lutein is available for the body to absorb, no conclusions can be drawn as to how much lutein is actually absorbed. Therefore, the researchers will be conducting a human study in which they will measure the amount of lutein absorbed from smoothies made with different products.

  "question_squad": " What is an indole?",
  "answer_squad": " an organic compound consisting of a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring",
  "text": "A research group at Nagoya University in Japan has successfully developed an ultrafast and simple synthetic method for producing indole derivatives. Their findings are expected to make drug production more efficient and increase the range of potential indole-based pharmaceuticals to treat a variety of diseases. Their findings were published in Communications Chemistry.          An indole is an organic compound consisting of a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring. Heteroatom alkylation at the carbon atom next the indole ring is particularly useful to create wide range of new indole derivatives and many anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial treatments contain themIn the past, this heteroatom alkylation has proven difficult because indoles easily and rapidly undergo unwanted dimerization/multimerization, processes in which two or more molecules combine during the reaction to form unwanted larger molecules. These unwanted by-products limit the yield of the desired product.Since indoles are common to so many drugs, an efficient method of synthesizing them is essential. Now, a team consisting of Assistant Professor Hisashi Masui (he/him), graduate student Sena Kanda (she/her), and Professor Shinichiro Fuse (he/him) at the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya University, obtained the target indole-based product in high yield while limiting side reactions using a new microflow synthesis method.Their method consists of flowing a solution through a small channel with an inner diameter of about 1 mm. Because of its small size, the channel has a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, allowing the solution to be mixed in a few milliseconds. This allows for precise control of short reaction times and limits the time when unstable intermediates are present in the reaction process to only about 0.1 seconds. This is fast enough to prevent unwanted dimerization/multimerization.\"Although it takes several seconds to mix solutions using a flask, the microflow synthesis method does it in less than a few milliseconds,\" Fuse said.\"Therefore, short reaction times of less than a second can be generated and more precisely controlled and the reaction temperature can be fully controlled. We created an activated indole compound in 20 ms to achieve a target product yield of 95%. When the same reaction was performed in a standard flask, the target product could not be obtained at all, and side reactions occurred during the mixing of the solutions.\"\"Since the developed method can be used to synthesize various indole derivatives, our study is useful for creating drug candidates and improving the efficiency of drug production,\" said Fuse. \"The reaction proceeds at an extremely high speed under mild room temperature conditions, and the reactants used are readily available and inexpensive, making it highly practical.\"The group sees many potential industrial applications. Fuse emphasized that the flow synthesis method can be reproducibly scaled up by continuous pumping, making it an ideal choice for manufacturing facilities. \"Indoles are one of the most abundant structures in pharmaceuticals,\" he said. \"We expect it to contribute to the creation of drug candidates and the efficiency of pharmaceutical production.\" More information:Hisashi Masui et al, Verification of preparations of (1H-indol-3-yl)methyl electrophiles and development of their microflow rapid generation and substitution, Communications Chemistry (2023).

  "text": "Scientists from around the world have developed a simple metallic coating treatment for clothing or wearable textiles which can repair itself, repel bacteria from the wearer and even monitor a person's electrocardiogram (ECG) heart signals.          Researchers from North Carolina State University, Flinders University and South Korea say the conductive circuits created by liquid metal (LM) particles can transform wearable electronics and open doors for further development of human-machine interfaces, including soft robotics and health monitoring systems.The \"breathable\" electronic textiles have special connectivity powers to \"autonomously heal\" itself even when cut, says the U.S. team led by international expert in the field, Professor Michael Dickey.When the coated textiles are pressed with significant force, the particles merge into a conductive path, which enables the creation of circuits that can maintain conductivity when stretched, researchers say.\"The conductive patterns autonomously heal when cut by forming new conductive paths along the edge of the cut, providing a self-healing feature which makes these textiles useful as circuit interconnects, Joule heaters and flexible electrodes to measure ECG signals,\" says Flinders University medical biotechnology researcher Dr. Khanh Truong, senior co-author in a new article in Advanced Materials Technologies.The technique involves dip-coating fabric into a suspension of LM particles at room temperature.                Dr Vi-Khanh Truong, left, with masters biotech student Tien Thanh Nguyen at the Flinders University lab. Credit: Flinders University             \"Evenly coated textiles remain electrically insulating due to the native oxide that forms on the LM particles. However, the insulating effect can be removed by compressing the textile to rupture the oxide and thereby allow the particles to percolate.\"This enables the creation of conductive circuits by compressing the textile with a patterned mold. The electrical conductivity of the circuits increases by coating more particles on the textile\" say the researchers.As well the LM-coated textiles offer effective antimicrobial protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.This germ repellent ability not only gives the treated fabric protective qualities but prevents the porous material from becoming contaminated if worn for and extended time, or put in contact with other people.The particles of gallium-based liquid metals have low melting point, metallic electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity, effectively zero vapor pressure, low toxicity and antimicrobial properties.LMs have both fluidic and metallic properties so show great promise in applications such as microfluidics, soft composites, sensors, thermal switches and microelectronics.One of the advantages of LM is that it can be deposited and patterned at room temperature onto surfaces in unconventional ways that are not possible with solid metals.

  "text": "The human body relies heavily on electrical charges. Lightning-like pulses of energy fly through the brain and nerves and most biological processes depend on electrical ions traveling across the membranes of each cell in our body.          These electrical signals are possible, in part, because of an imbalance in electrical charges that exists on either side of a cellular membrane. Until recently, researchers believed the membrane was an essential component to creating this imbalance. But that thought was turned on its head when researchers at Stanford University discovered that similar imbalanced electrical charges can exist between microdroplets of water and air.Now, researchers at Duke University have discovered that these types of electric fields also exist within and around another type of cellular structure called biological condensates. Like oil droplets floating in water, these structures exist because of differences in density. They form compartments inside the cell without needing the physical boundary of a membrane.Inspired by previous research demonstrating that microdroplets of water interacting with air or solid surfaces create tiny electrical imbalances, the researchers decided to see if the same was true for small biological condensates. They also wanted to see if these imbalances sparked reactive oxygen, \"redox,\" reactions like these other systems.Appearing on April 28 in the journal Chem, their foundational discovery could change the way researchers think about biological chemistry. It could also provide a clue as to how the first life on Earth harnessed the energy needed to arise.\"In a prebiotic environment without enzymes to catalyze reactions, where would the energy come from?\" asked Yifan Dai, a Duke postdoctoral researcher working in the laboratory of Ashutosh Chilkoti, the Alan L. Kaganov Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Lingchong You, the James L. Meriam Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering.\"This discovery provides a plausible explanation of where the reaction energy could have come from, just as the potential energy that is imparted on a point charge placed in an electric field,\" Dai said.When electric charges jump between one material and another, they can produce molecular fragments that can pair up and form hydroxyl radicals, which have the chemical formula OH. These can then pair again to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tiny but detectable amounts.      \"But interfaces have seldom been studied in biological regimes other than the cellular membrane, which is one of the most essential part of biology,\" said Dai. \"So we were wondering what might be happening at the interface of biological condensates, that is, if it is an asymmetric system too.\"Cells can build biological condensates to either separate or trap together certain proteins and molecules, either hindering or promoting their activity. Researchers are just beginning to understand how condensates work and what they could be used for.Because the Chilkoti laboratory specializes in creating synthetic versions of naturally occurring biological condensates, the researchers were easily able to create a test bed for their theory. After combining the right formula of building blocks to create minuscule condensates, with help from postdoctoral scholar Marco Messina in? Christopher J. Chang's group at the University of California\u2014Berkeley, they added a dye to the system that glows in the presence of reactive oxygen species.Their hunch was right. When the environmental conditions were right, a solid glow started from the edges of the condensates, confirming that a previously unknown phenomenon was at work. Dai next talked with Richard Zare, the Marguerite Blake Wilbur Professor of Chemistry at Stanford, whose group established the electric behavior of water droplets. Zare was excited to hear about the new behavior in biological systems, and started to work with the group on the underlying mechanism.\"Inspired by previous work on water droplets, my graduate student, Christian Chamberlayne, and I thought that the same physical principles might apply and promote redox chemistry, such as the formation of hydrogen peroxide molecules,\" Zare said. \"These findings suggest why condensates are so important in the functioning of cells.\"\"Most previous work on biomolecular condensates has focused on their innards,\" Chilkoti said. \"Yifan's discovery that biomolecular condensates appear to be universally redox-active suggests that condensates did not simply evolve to carry out specific biological functions as is commonly understood, but that they are also endowed with a critical chemical function that is essential to cells.\"While the biological implications of this ongoing reaction within our cells is not known, Dai points to a prebiotic example of how powerful its effects might be. The powerhouses of our cells, called mitochondria, create energy for all of our life's functions through the same basic chemical process. But before mitochondria or even the simplest of cells existed, something had to provide energy for the very first of life's functions to begin working.Researchers have proposed that the energy was provided by thermal vents in the oceans or hot springs. Others have suggested this same redox reaction that occurs in water microdroplets was created by the spray of ocean waves.But why not condensates instead?\"Magic can happen when substances get tiny and the interfacial volume becomes enormous compared to its volume,\" Dai said. \"I think the implications are important to many different fields.\" More information:Yifan Dai et al, Interface of biomolecular condensates modulates redox reactions, Chem (2023).

  "answer_squad": " CAS",
  "text": "Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) featured with high volatility and high adsorption is a common toxic and hazardous gas. Traces of HCN are also found in human exhaled breath. Unusual high HCN concentration in the breath of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection. Therefore, the development of a highly sensitive online HCN measurement in exhaled breath can enable rapid screening for PA infection in CF patients.          Recently, a research group led by Prof. Li Haiyang from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has developed a flow-assisted photoionization mass spectrometry method for profiling hydrogen cyanide in exhaled breath.The study was published in Analytical Chemistry on April 4.\"HCN is easily soluble in water and highly adsorbed on device surfaces, so sensitivity and response speed are main challenges for directly measuring HCN in exhaled breath at high humidity presents,\" said Prof. Chen Ping, co-corresponding author of this study.The researchers developed a method by utilizing a self-developed atmospheric pressure negative photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer instrument and improved the sensitivity and time resolution of direct HCN measurements in exhaled breath. This method enabled real-time tracking of HCN concentrations in a single exhaled breath, which could provide an effective means for early screening of CF patients with PA infection.They proposed to use helium shield gas within the mass spectrometry ionization source. This approach reduced the effect of high humidity on ionization, improved ion transport efficiency, and thus enhanced HCN detection sensitivity.Moreover, they improved the sampling system by shortening the sampling line and adding a gas purging process to effectively reduce HCN adsorption residue and improve time resolution. This method achieved a limit of detection of 0.3 ppbv and a resolution time of 0.5 s.By utilizing this method, the researchers tracked the changes in the single exhaled HCN profiles of volunteers before and after gargling. The resulting profiles clearly showed an early peak and a stable end-tidal plateau, representing the concentration of the oral cavity and end-tidal gas, respectively.\"The new method demonstrated good resistance to interference and high accuracy in HCN quantification. It has potential applications in the detection of PA infection in CF patients,\" said Prof. Li.

  "text": "People's ability to regenerate bones declines with age and is further decreased by diseases such as osteoporosis. To help the aging population, researchers are looking for new therapies that improve bone regeneration.          Now, an interdisciplinary team of researchers from the Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC) and the Medical Faculty of TU Dresden along with a group from Max Bergmann Center of Biomaterials (MBC) developed novel bio-inspired molecules that enhance bone regeneration in mice. The results were published in the journal Biomaterials.As people age, their ability to regenerate bones decreases. Fractures take longer to heal and diseases like osteoporosis only add to it. This represents a serious health challenge to the aging population and an increasing socioeconomic burden for the society. To help combat this issue, researchers are looking for new therapeutic approaches that can improve bone regeneration.A team of scientists from Dresden used computer modeling and simulations to design novel bio-inspired molecules to enhance bone regeneration in mice. The new molecules can be incorporated into biomaterials and applied locally to bone defects. These new molecules are based on glycosaminoglycans, which are long-chained sugars such as hyaluronic acid or heparin.A sweet solution for an old bone\"Thanks to our group's work and the work of other researchers, we know a distinct molecular pathway that regulates bone formation and repair. In fact, we can narrow it down to two proteins that work together to block bone regeneration, sclerostin and dickkopf-1\" explains Prof. Lorenz Hofbauer, \"The big challenge for developing drugs that improve bone healing is to efficiently turn off both of these proteins, which act as brake signals, at the same time.\"An interdisciplinary approach was a key to this challenge. The Structural Bioinformatics group led by Prof. Maria Teresa Pisabarro at the Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC) of TU Dresden and the Functional Biomaterials group led by PD Dr. Vera Hintze at the Max Bergmann Center of Biomaterials (MBC), Institute of Materials Science of TU Dresden combined their know-how with bone expert Prof. Lorenz Hofbauer at the Medical Faculty of TU Dresden.\"For several years, we have harnessed the power of computer simulations to investigate how proteins regulating bone formation interact with their receptors. All this to design new molecules that can efficiently interfere with these interactions. We worked in tandem between the computer and the bench, designing new molecules and testing them, feeding the results back to our molecular models and learning more about the molecular properties required for our goal,\" explains Prof. Pisabarro.Finally, the team of Lorenz Hofbauer's Bone Lab used a biomaterial loaded with the new molecules on bone defects in mice to test their effectiveness. The group found that materials containing the novel molecules outperformed the standard biomaterial and enhanced bone healing by up to 50%, which indicates their potential for improving bone regeneration.      Value-added chain: From computer to the lab bench and backThe multidisciplinary team used rational drug design to create novel molecules with tailored properties and minimal side effects. By using computational methods to predict and refine the properties of the designed molecules, the team was able to develop a series of candidates with the greatest potential for turning off the proteins that block bone regeneration.Pisabarro group's expertise allowed the thorough analysis of the three-dimensional (3D) structures of the two proteins that block bone regeneration. With that, they were able to model their interaction with their receptors in 3D and identify so-called hot spots, i.e., specific physicochemical and dynamic properties that are essential for the biological interaction to occur.\"We used molecular modeling to design new structures that mimic relevant receptor interactions with both proteins. We wanted this binding to be stronger than their natural interactions. In this way, our novel molecules would simultaneously hijack the proteins and effectively turn them off to turn the bone regeneration on,\" explains Prof. Pisabarro.\"The molecules designed by Pisabarro's group were synthesized by our colleagues at the Free University of Berlin and then analyzed regarding their protein binding properties via biophysical interaction analysis,\" says PD Dr. Hintze. \"For each of the molecules we were able to measure the binding strength with the proteins and their interference with natural receptor binding of the proteins. Thus, we could reveal empirically how effective each of the small molecules could be at turning off the inhibitory proteins.\" Hofbauer group then tested the biological relevance of these interaction studies in a cell culture model and later in mice.The results of such iterative testing are a valuable asset that enhances the current molecular models of the Pisabarro group and can be used to guide the development of novel and better molecules in the future. Such an approach also ensures that animal research is minimized and enters the project only in its final phase.The team's findings represent an exciting step forward in preclinical development. The newly designed molecules could potentially be used to turn off the proteins that block bone regeneration and lead to the development of novel, more effective treatments for bone fractures and other bone-related conditions.

  "text": "Ensuring the supply of food to the constantly growing world population and protecting the environment at the same time are often conflicting objectives. Now researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have successfully developed a method for the synthetic manufacture of nutritional protein using a type of artificial photosynthesis. The animal feed industry is the primary driver of high demand for large volumes of nutritional protein, which is also suitable for use in meat substitute products.          A group led by Prof. Volker Sieber at the TUM Campus Straubing for Biotechnology and Sustainability (TUMCS) has succeeded in producing the amino acid L-alanine, an essential building block in proteins, from the environmentally harmful gas CO2.Their indirect biotechnological process involves methanol as an intermediate. Until now, protein for animal feed has been typically produced in the southern hemisphere with large-scale agricultural space requirements and negative consequences for biodiversity. The paper is published in the journal Chem Catalysis.The CO2, which is removed from the atmosphere, is first turned into methanol using green electricity and hydrogen. The new method converts this intermediate into L-alanine in a multi-stage process using synthetic enzymes; the method is extremely effective and generates very high yields. L-alanine is one of the most important components of protein, which is essential to the nutrition of both humans and animals.Prof. Sieber, of the TUM Professorship for Chemistry of Biogenic Resources, explains, \"Compared to growing plants, this method requires far less space to create the same amount of L-alanine, when the energy used comes from solar or wind power sources. The more efficient use of space means a kind of artificial photosynthesis can be used to produce the same amount of foodstuffs on significantly fewer acres. This paves the way for a smaller ecological footprint in agriculture.\"The manufacture of L-alanine is only the first step for the scientists. \"We also want to produce other amino acids from CO2 using renewable energy and to further increase efficiency in the realization process,\" says co-author Vivian Willers, who developed the process as a doctoral candidate at the TUM Campus Straubing. The researchers add that the project is a good example of how bioeconomy and hydrogen economy in combination can make it possible to achieve more sustainability.

  "text": "David Needham, professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke University, has demonstrated that a metabolic inhibiting drug called niclosamide, traditionally used to treat gut parasites, can readily be extracted and dissolved from commercial tablets in quantities sufficient to create throat and nasal sprays.          Combined with previous research that shows niclosamide might be able to prevent or inhibit the growth cycle of common respiratory viruses\u2014including COVID-19\u2014the results may point toward an easier pathway through the testing, regulatory approval and manufacturing processes needed to bring a potential product to market.The research was published online April 14 in the journal American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists Open (AAPS Open).\"These results show a potentially more rapid route to FDA approval, bringing a new commercial opportunity that could make the nasal sprays more readily available worldwide,\" Needham said. \"This would not just potentially be for COVID-19, but also for all respiratory viruses including Influenza and Respiratory Syncytia Virus (RSV) and to increase our preparedness for the next pandemic that seems sure to be coming down the pipe.\"Since 1958, niclosamide has been used to treat gut parasite infections in humans as well as pets and farm animals. Delivered as oral tablets, the drug kills the parasites on contact by inhibiting their crucial metabolic pathway and shutting down their energy supply.In recent years, however, researchers have been testing niclosamide's potential to treat a much wider range of diseases, such as many types of cancer, metabolic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis. Recent laboratory studies in cells have also shown the drug to be a potent antiviral medication, inhibiting a virus's ability to cause disease by targeting the energy supply of the host cell that the virus co-opts for its self-replication.                David Needham works at a lab bench to create anti-COVID throat and nasal sprays from commercial niclosamide. Credit: Duke University             Needham showed in 2022 that the drug could be dissolved into high enough concentrations to create a potential throat or nasal spray by a simple change in the solution's pH. This was an important result, as researchers had previously believed the drug to be too insoluble to form such solutions.      Needham is now working with colleagues Zachary Kelleher in the lab of Christina Barkauskas, assistant professor of medicine in pulmonary medicine at Duke, to evaluate how niclosamide brings down the available energy in human nasal and bronchial cells. The team is also working to show that niclosamide is safe at concentrations above those where it has been found in the literature to prevent viral infection. They are now testing the effects of niclosamide in the Duke Regional Biocontainment Laboratory to see if it can prevent infection in more respiratory-relevant cells.\"Academic papers and companies actively involved in potential niclosamide products were automatically invoking much more complex formulations,\" Needham said. \"I showed that you could raise the solubility to what you would want for this spray-style application.\"Because the tablets are already FDA approved, the spray solution formulation seemed set for a straightforward approval and launch into a safety-efficacy clinical trial. However, the FDA viewed this throat/nasal spray as a new formulation that needed to be tested from square one, despite its concentrations being millions of times lower than the oral tablets that have been approved for more than 50 years.By showing that enough niclosamide can be extracted from this already-approved formulation, Needham is hoping to expedite the testing and approval process.\"Having laid out the way to make the throat/nasal spray solutions by the simplest of techniques and showing that it can be readily scaled up to liters of volumes, my hope is that one or more companies will recognize not only the commercial opportunity, but also that this is the right thing to do to save lives and reduce suffering across the planet,\" Needham said.Moving forward, Needham is working to optimize these niclosamide-based solutions with an additional depot of dissolvable solid microparticles of niclosamide so that the throat and nasal tissue is continually supplied with safe concentrations of the drug. He's also looking to engage public labs, companies, institutes and governments to make and test the formulations.

  "text": "Scientists from the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry in Prague have deciphered the structure of the protein methyltransferase from the monkeypox virus. It is with the help of this protein that the virus escapes human immunity and causes the monkeypox disease. Based on this discovery, they have prepared substances that can block the function of methyltransferase.          The results of this research may constitute the first step towards creating a completely new group of antivirals. This applies not only to monkeypox, but also to diseases caused by other viruses, including COVID-19 induced by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.An article on the results of the work of the scientific groups led by Dr. Ev\u017een Bou\u0159a and Dr. Radim Nencka has now been published in Nature Communications. Both teams have for many years been studying viruses that cause serious diseases. In the past, they focused on the Zika virus from the flavivirus group or the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the coronavirus group.Like other viruses, the monkeypox virus multiplies in a host cell. For it to defend itself against external attack, it needs to recognize which RNA molecules are its own and which are not. \"Native RNA molecules carry a special marker called a cap for easier recognition. An unmarked molecule triggers an innate antiviral immunity response in infected cells. Therefore, viruses try to deceive the human body and, for example, the monkeypox virus confuses it by also adding a cap to its RNA,\" explains Ev\u017een Bou\u0159a.The symptoms of monkeypox resemble those of smallpox, a disease that has already been eradicated. Until recently, the virus causing it was found only in Central and Western Africa. Its natural reservoirs reside in rodents and primates. In humans it can cause a disease with an estimated mortality rate of 3% to 6%. While this is less than in the case of smallpox, it is much higher than, for example, with COVID-19.Recently, the monkeypox virus has spread worldwide, so it is no wonder that not only experts, but also the general population and public authorities are nervously watching the threat of another global viral pandemic. \"Our colleagues perfectly combine structural biology and cutting-edge medicinal chemistry. Thanks to that, we are closer to discovering new antivirals,\" says Prof. Jan Konvalinka, the director of IOCB Prague.

Identifying the crystallographic structure sensitivity of catalysts in chemical reactions is helpful to the rational design of catalysts. However, direct and convincing study to correlate the crystal structure of oxide to its catalytic performance has yet to be done.Recently, a joint research team led by Prof. Bao Xinhe, Prof. Pan Xiulian, Assoc. Prof. Jiao Feng and Prof. Xiao Jianping from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has observed strong crystal phase-dependent activity of MnGaOx in direct syngas conversion. This study was published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition on April 18.\"The main challenge to observing the crystal structure of oxide is the lack of a well-defined material-synthesis method to obtain metal oxides with the same element components but different crystallographic structures,\" said Jiao.In this study, the researchers found co-precipitation method and hydrothermal method could synthesize bimetallic oxides, which were composed of amorphous MnO2 and Ga2O3 with hexagonal close-packed (HCP) or Face centered-cubic (FCC) crystal phase, respectively. More interestingly, they found that the HCP oxide remained unchanged as HCP MnO-Ga2O3 solid solution oxides after reduction under H2 or CO, while the FCC solid solution oxide transformed into FCC spinel structure, where reduced Mn2+ took the A-site of AB2O4 spinel structure.They obtained 40% CO conversion, 81% light olefins selectivity, and 0.17 g\u00b7gcat-1\u00b7h-1 space-time yield of light olefins with the combination of FCC MnGaOx-Spinel and SAPO-18. In comparison, they obtained a much inferior activity with solid solution MnGaOx with a similar chemical composition.They further proved that the superior activity of MnGaOx-Spinel was attributed to its higher reducibility and the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ site, which facilitated the dissociation of the C-O bond via a more efficient ketene-acetate pathway to light olefins.\"Our findings may further optimize metal oxides for OXZEO syngas conversion,\" said Prof. Pan.

  "text": "As the proverb goes, it takes a village to raise a child. It can also take a village to make progress in science and medicine.          In this case, labs from not one, not two, but three departments in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School, along with a colleague in France, came together to figure out the structure of a tricky receptor involved in heart, lung, liver, and kidney function as well as pregnancy.Untangling this structure, described April 20 in Nature Chemical Biology, provides a foundation for developing drugs that act on the receptor with the goal of treating heart disease and conditions marked by the buildup of scar tissue, or fibrosis. Those include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic disease of the lungs; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; and scleroderma, which affects the skin, joints, and internal organs.The work may also pique the interest of other scientists who study basic biology because the receptor has an unusual structure that stands out from other members of its family, the G protein-coupled receptors.\"This was a very difficult receptor to characterize,\" said senior author Andrew Kruse, HMS professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology. \"The collaboration of multiple labs was essential, and the project highlights the value of combining experimental and computational methods.\"\"You have a lot of great opportunities at HMS to work with talented scientists who use different techniques than you,\" agreed Sarah Erlandson, who led the work as a graduate student in the Kruse lab. \"That allowed us to form a more complete picture of the receptor and study it in more ways than we could by ourselves.\"A relaxin possibilityThe receptor's name is a mouthful: relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1, or RXFP1. It gets that name because it and its three receptor siblings bind to hormones called relaxins.Relaxins are best known for initiating a constellation of changes in the body during pregnancy, including relaxing ligaments in the pelvis in preparation for childbirth. It also boosts sperm movement. But scientists have grown to appreciate the hormone's many non-reproductive roles as well, including dilating blood vessels to increase blood flow, stimulating the growth of new blood vessels, breaking down collagen, and reducing inflammation and fibrosis.Relaxins do all of this when they get released from tissues such as the heart, prostate, and placenta and bind to receptors in the membranes of cells in certain organs. The receptors then send signals that spur the cells to act.Most relaxins stay local, but one type, relaxin-2, travels throughout the body via the blood. This is the relaxin that binds to RXFP1.Relaxin-2's involvement in so many bodily processes has turned scientists' eyes toward treating diseases by mimicking higher or lower levels of the hormone. Doing so requires designing drugs that bind to RXFP1\u2014which is hard to do without knowing its structure.\"There are no drugs available that target this receptor,\" said Erlandson, who now works as a research scientist at Takeda Pharmaceuticals. \"People are interested in it as an option for treatment of cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases, but when you don't understand the detailed structure, it limits your ability to target it.\"So, the teams got to work.      It takes two to tango, four to solve a receptor structureThe Kruse lab took the first step by using cryo-electron microscopy to reveal what RXFP1 looks like at the near-atomic level when bound to relaxin-2.But one blurry spot remained where a flexible part of the receptor kept changing position from one snapshot to the next. That elusive part was the most important one\u2014the part that binds to relaxin.Members of the lab of Steven Gygi, HMS professor of cell biology, tackled the problem using mass spectrometry, a different method for determining structural information that measures atomic weights. Combining the experimental cryo-EM results with the mass spectrometry data allowed Erlandson to fill in the missing structural details.Now the researchers could see the receptor in its active, or \"on,\" state, bound to relaxin-2. The structure suggested that the receptor could turn itself on. If that were true, what prevented it from being on all the time, sending cell-activation signals whether relaxin was there or not?Insight came from Debora Marks, HMS associate professor of systems biology, and Xiaojing Cong at the Institute of Functional Genomics (IGF) in France. They used computational techniques\u2014including one called evolutionary coupling analysis, which looks at protein sequences that change together over time\u2014to predict how different parts of the receptor might shift around between its active and inactive states.At last, the story revealed itself.When RXFP1 is alone, no relaxins in sight, it's turned off. When relaxin-2 binds to it, multiple parts of the receptor change shape and communicate with one another to flip the \"on\" switch.The collaboration allowed the team to answer open questions about how RXFP1's multiple parts move around and work together to allow the receptor to do its job. The way it binds to relaxin-2 hasn't been seen in many of its receptor relatives.With RXFP1's active structure in hand, researchers now have a lock to design therapeutic keys for.\"It was really exciting to get to the point in the project where we saw the structure and were making these discoveries,\" said Erlandson. \"There's more work to be done, but this makes a big contribution that benefits scientists and could ultimately help patients.\"Additional authors are Shaun Rawson, James Osei-Owusu, Kelly P.

  "text": "In agriculture and medicine, isothiourea compounds play an important role as an important synthetic intermediate. As well as being potent inhibitors of biological targets, isothioureas can be used as organocatalysts or ligands in transition metal catalysis.          In a study published in the journal Green Synthesis and Catalysis, a group of researchers from China outlines a new electrocatalytic three-component reaction method for the synthesis of isothioureas.Multicomponent reactions have advantages over classical methods, such as operational simplicity, economical steps, avoidance of cumbersome purification process, energy efficiency, and minimization of waste generation. Among the reported methods for the synthesis of isothioureas by multi-component reactions, sulfur source is limited, with the reliance of reactions on heavy metal catalysts or stoichiometric oxidants.In order to solve the existing problems, the team led by Professors Yingming Pan and Haitao Tang from the School of Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Guangxi Normal University found that when thiols, isocyanides and amines are used as substrates, isothiourea derivatives can be synthesized through free radicals under electrochemical conditions.Notably, this reaction process does not need heavy metal catalysis and stoichiometric oxidants and has the advantages of wide substrate applicability, good functional group tolerance and high atomic economy.Using this new approach, isothioureas were synthesized by oxidation of thiophenols with different substituents to sulfur radicals under electrochemical conditions using isocyanides with various reactive sites as substrates.\"When isocyanides were attacked by radicals, they formed imine carbon radical active intermediates, and reacted with aniline to synthesize isothioureas,\" explained Pan. \"The synthesis strategy of more complex isothioureas was constructed by controlling the formation of iminocarbon radical active intermediates from isocyanides by the electrochemical method.\"According to Muxue He, a researcher involved in this study, this is a major breakthrough in the construction of isothiourea derivatives through multi-component reactions. \"So far, multicomponent construction of isothioureas has required the use of heavy metal catalysts and stoichiometric oxidants. Our method shows that these reagents can be avoided by means of electrochemical synthesis.\"\"We hope that our results will encourage scientists to continue to investigate facile and efficient synthetic strategies for isothioureas,\" added Tang.

  "answer_squad": " keratin",
  "text": "Hair styling can be a potent form of self-expression, whether it features dramatic updos, intricate braids or crazy colors. Beyond being a reflection of our personality, these strands contain compounds that could one day appear in bandages, sunscreens or other products. Researchers reporting in ACS Omega have now designed a simple, green process to extract both keratin and melanin from human hair for these possible applications without harsh chemicals or excessive waste.          Hair is made up of protein filaments consisting of many different layers and components. Its structure comes from the protein keratin, which can also be found in fingernails, horns and feathers. Its color is provided by melanin, a group of pigment molecules that are also found in the skin and eyes. In addition, melanin has antioxidative properties and can help shield against ultraviolet light.These qualities make the compounds suitable for biomedical applications; however, since most discarded hair is incinerated or dumped in landfills, its keratin and melanin are largely unused as well. Chemically extracting them from hair is possible, but current protocols either can only extract one compound at a time, or rely on harsh chemicals and complicated steps. So, Paulomi Ghosh and colleagues wanted to develop a straightforward method to extract both keratin and melanin from human hair with a single procedure, using a recyclable, green solvent.The researchers collected samples of hair from local salons, then washed and cut them into small slices. Then, they mixed the hair with an ionic liquid, which dissolved the mixture by interrupting the hydrogen bonds that held the keratin proteins together. When heated and poured into a hydrochloric acid solution, the melanin pigments precipitated out and were collected. Next, the researchers performed dialysis to collect the keratin proteins. The ionic liquid was recycled and reused in subsequent reactions, without a significant impact on the reaction's yield.Recovered keratin was compatible with blood, suggesting that it could be used in heavy-duty hemostatic bandages. This extraction procedure also maintained the natural structure of the melanin, which was lost in other, harsher methods. Because the melanin had good antioxidative and UV shielding properties, the team says it could be used in sun-protective products or films. The researchers say that this technique could serve as a green way to sustainably extract useful biopolymers from otherwise discarded materials.

  "text": "Scripps Research scientists have developed a new strategy for identifying small molecules that can change the function of proteins, offering a promising path for discovering targeted drugs. In collaboration with scientists at other institutions, the group used their new approach to find small molecules that can alter the activity of proteins involved in cancer.          The research, published in Molecular Cell on April 20, improves on previous methods that could screen for whether small molecules selectively attached to proteins, but not whether they affected the proteins' biological activities. The new method revolves around using two mirror-image versions of a small molecule and comparing how they change the size of protein complexes in cells.\"The ability of small molecules to specifically bind to a protein and cause a biological consequence is the fundamental basis for most drugs today,\" says senior author Benjamin Cravatt, Ph.D., Gilula Chair of Chemical Biology at Scripps Research. \"With this assay, we're expanding our ability to discover these small molecules that not only bind proteins, but have functional impacts.\"In recent years, Cravatt's lab has designed sets of small chemicals that can irreversibly bind to certain parts of proteins. However, screening these chemical libraries to discover their possible impact on protein function was generally a slow and tedious process. Since individual proteins have different roles in cell biology, researchers often have to develop specialized functional screens for each protein of interest. One screen, for instance, might determine whether the chemicals affected cell growth, while another might determine whether the chemicals changed levels of a different molecule.\"Just because a small molecule engages a protein physically doesn't mean that it changes the protein's function in the cell,\" says co-first author Jarrett Remsberg, Ph.D., who carried out the work as an American Cancer Society postdoctoral research fellow in the Cravatt lab at Scripps Research. Former graduate student Michael Lazear, Ph.D. and postdoctoral fellow Martin Jaeger, Ph.D. were also first authors of the paper.In the new work, Cravatt's group used the conglomeration of proteins into complexes as a proxy for their function. Proteins often work by binding to other proteins\u2014if this binding doesn't happen or if it is induced to happen, it indicates a protein's function may have changed.The research team designed pairs of \"mirror image\" molecules, called stereoisomers, that could each bind irreversibly to proteins in the same way that their previous chemical libraries had worked. The pairs of stereoisomers let them be sure that the impact of each small molecule was due to its unique structure (if only one version of a molecule changes the proteins' function, it is likely a specific and direct interaction).      Once they exposed cells to the pairs of stereoisomers, they tested whether a protein-of-interest was in a different size complex, using a technique called size exclusion chromatography in which proteins are sifted through beads with different sized pores.To show the utility of this approach, the researchers screened the set of small molecules for their ability to change the sizes of protein complexes in prostate cancer cells. They pinpointed a molecule, MY-1B, which selectively disrupted a complex of proteins known as PA28, previously found to play a role in degrading proteins in cancer. Further work in leukemia cells confirmed that, by specifically binding to the protein PMSE1, MY-1B or a related compound (but not their mirror images) could effectively inactivate the PA28 complex.Cravatt and colleagues also followed up on an observation that a different chemical, EV-96, changed the size of a protein complex involved in splicing strands of RNA inside cells. The team discovered that EV-96 slowed the growth of cancer cells and pinpointed SF3B1 as the protein the chemical was binding to.In both cases, the new chemicals represent the first time scientists have been able to target the protein complexes\u2014PA28 and the so-called spliceosome\u2014 with small, simple synthetic chemicals.\"This means that researchers have new chemical tools in their arsenal that they didn't have before,\" says Remsberg. \"It's an opportunity for better understanding these proteins as well as investigating potential therapeutic opportunities.\"The team hopes their approach can be expanded to use other functional readouts than complex size, and they intend to use it to study different cell types in the future.\"The long-term idea is that we can use this approach to discover chemical compounds that impinge upon any readout,\" says Cravatt. \"There are certainly other readouts that we hope to be able to look at in the future.\" More information:Michael R.

  "answer_squad": " electrified spatiotemporal heating",
  "text": "A team of engineers and materials scientists affiliated with multiple institutions in the U.S., has developed a new way to depolymerize plastics using electrified spatiotemporal heating. In their paper, published in the journal Nature, the group describes the new process and its efficiency. Nature has also published a Research Briefing in the same journal issue outlining the work done by the team.          Over the past several years, plastic pollution has become a major concern, both for the environment and for the health of plants and animals, including humans, and scientists are seeking ways to recycle it. Most of the techniques developed thus far involve using chemicals to depolymerize plastics. These efforts are still extremely inefficient, however, with yields between 10% and 25%. In this new effort, the team has found a way to use pulsed electricity to boost the yield to approximately 36%.The approach involved designing a new kind of reactor with a porous carbon felt bilayer and a pulsed electric heater at the top. In their reactor, plastic bits are melted as they are fed in to the upper chamber and flow as a mass into a lower chamber, where the material is pushed through the felt filter. The plastic then begins to decompose as the temperature rises. As the molecules that make up the plastic become smaller, their volatility grows until they are expelled from the reactor as a gas, which allows more liquid to be drawn in. Using electricity to heat the plastic allows for oscillating the temperature, allowing simpler depolymerization reactions to take precedence over side reactions, which need additional heating to depolymerize.In addition to improving efficiency, the new approach uses less energy because of the oscillating instead of constant heat source. The team notes the system could be made more eco-friendly by using renewable sources for the electricity. They note that their reactor does emit other materials, such as acetylene, methane and some larger molecules, along with some aromatics. They also acknowledge that more work is required to reduce the amount of carbon released during the reactions.

  "text": "Powder thermal diffusion alloying is an important surface strengthening method that can fabricate an anticorrosion coating on magnesium alloys.       The diffusion time for most diffusion alloying processes varies from tens of minutes to hours. Meanwhile, it is hard to tell whether the diffusion source has already failed or not in the end of the diffusion alloying process.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Huang Yanliang from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS) has determined the effective time of a diffusion source that contains 10 g ZnO and 1 g NH4Cl at 400 \u2103. Surprisingly, the effective time of such a diffusion source can be longer than 150 hours.The study was published in the Journal of Materials Research and Technology.Results showed that a looser and purer diffusion source and a better air tightness of the crucible could help to prolong the effective time of the diffusion source. A longer preheating time of the diffusion source was preferred for the fabrication of a thicker Zn-rich diffusion alloyed coating in the first diffusion alloying process.                The as obtained Zn-rich coatings fabricated on Mg alloy specimens after the first diffusion alloying process with a pre-sintering time of 25 h, 50 h, 75 h, 100 h and 125 h for the diffusion source.

  "text": "Human lives have been revolutionized since lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) were successfully commercialized. However, modern portable electronics have increased energy demands and thus require batteries with high energy density. Directly using Li metal as an anode is considered a promising strategy due to its ultra-high capacity (3860 mA h g-1) and low negative electrochemical potential (- 3.04 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode).          However, using Li metal is currently not possible due to unsatisfactory cyclability, serious safety issues, and poor rate capability. A particularly important issue is the formation of a weak solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The SEI layer is formed when Li metal reacts with the electrolyte. Owing to its instability, the SEI layer often breaks down because of the large volume variation of lithium metal.The breakdown of SEI leads to the exposure of unreacted Li, which subsequently reacts with liquid electrolytes to form more SEI and thereby causes cell failure during the cycling process. Additionally, uneven nucleation and the forming of needle-like Li dendrites are other key issues restricting the use of Li metal as anodes. These result from increased local current density and eventually pierce the separator causing safety concerns. It is necessary to develop an effective strategy to inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites.Recently, Prof. Zhifeng Zheng's team from Xiamen University published a manuscript entitled \"Homogenous metallic deposition regulated by abundant lithiophilic sites in nickel/cobalt oxides nanoneedle arrays for lithium metal batteries\" in Journal of Energy Chemistry.Rock salt type NiO and CoO nanoneedle arrays were grown on lignin-derived carbon film to achieve reversible lithium stripping/plating cycling under high current density. The rational structure of the 3D networks plays an important role in promoting homogeneous Li-ion flux and alleviating local current density.The abundant lithiophilic sites in the film inhibit the Li dendritic growth and \"dead\" Li formation. Uniform bottom-up Li deposition can be facilitated by the unique three\u2013dimensional nanoneedle arrays. Because of its unique structure, the NCO-CNF electrode displayed stable lithium stripping/plating cycling up to 4000 h.Furthermore, the bottom of the unique structure has the strongest lithiophilic properties, followed by the surface of the nanoneedles and the surrounding channel. A NCO-CNF/Li|LFP full cell with an N/P ratio of three exhibits impressive reversibility at 0.5 C up to 80 cycles. In conclusion, the study proposes a rational strategy for designing lithiophilic substrates to induce homogenous metallic deposition, which is a potentially useful method for mitigating the dendrite issues in next-generation lithium metal batteries.

  "text": "Ion-transport membranes are vital components of clean-energy technologies, such as CO2 electrolyzers, water electrolyzers, fuel cells, redox flow batteries and ion-capture electrodialysis. These membranes must screen out specific substances to prevent crossover while efficiently conducting specific ions.          Polymer materials have the advantages of low cost, manufacturing scalability and small footprint, and thus dominate the use of ion-transport membranes in practical modules. However, the existing polymer membranes suffer from a ubiquitous \"conductivity-selectivity\" trade-off: highly conductive membranes tend to exhibit low selectivity and vice versa. This trade-off presents a challenge in developing membrane materials that meet the required performance criteria.In a study published in Nature on April 26, the research team led by Professor Xu Tongwen and Professor Yang Zhengjin from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and their collaborators, proposed a new type of ion exchange membrane\u2014triazine framework polymer membranes\u2014which can break the conductivity-selectivity trade-off.Compared to traditional materials, the triazine framework polymer membranes exhibited much enhanced capacity in both anti-swelling and anti-aging, showing an extremely low swelling ratio on water absorption. Their rigid channels ensured high selectivity from size-sieving, thus enabling extremely low permeability of active materials.Credit: Chinese Academy of SciencesWith proper control over the chemistry of rigid pore channels, the researchers observed near-frictionless ion flow within the all-rigid triazine framework polymer membrane (SCTF-BP), with the ion diffusion coefficient close to value in water. This is achieved by the robust micropore confinement within the rigid pore channels and multi-interaction between ion and membrane.These framework membranes exhibited both extremely low permeability of active materials and ultrahigh ion diffusivity, and their advantages were exemplified as ion-conducting membranes in 2,6-dihydroxy anthraquinone / K4[Fe(CN)6] aqueous organic redox flow batteries. The membrane delivered a neat area-specific resistance as low as 0.17 \u03a9 cm2, and thus enabled stable cell operation at extreme current densities, from 200 to 500 mA cm-2, with both high energy efficiency and high-capacity utilization.These data related to energy efficiency and capacity utilization far surpass those for otherwise identical cells assembled with commercial membranes and state-of-the-art ion-sieving membranes.This work highlights the importance of secondary interactions to develop high-performing ion-transport membranes. The design strategy proposed is believed to be broadly applicable, considering numerous options of organic reactions and functional monomers that can be utilized to construct polymer frameworks, and directs the fit-for-purpose design of membranes according to practical application demand.

  "text": "As freshwater scarcity affects millions worldwide, scientists and engineers have looked for new ways of filtering unwanted metals and minerals out of water while retaining those elements for re-use elsewhere.          Capacitive deionization (CDI), a technology in which a membrane made from electrode materials removes metal ions from water, has proved a promising technique for such next-generation water filters. Researchers from University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory envisioned the technique could be made even more efficient if they modified the molecular surface of the electrodes.With support from University of Chicago's Joint Task Force Initiative, three researchers investigated the best way to alter these surfaces. Junhong Chen, Crown Family Professor of Molecular Engineering at UChicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and Lead Water Strategist at Argonne, collaborated with two Argonne colleagues: scientist Maria Chan and senior physicist Chris Benmore. Using experimentation, machine learning, and powerful X-rays, they developed a CDI device that adsorbed lead much more efficiently than before.\"Our future economy and national security really depend on the availability of clean water,\" Chen said. \"The only way to really address this water challenge is to look into the re-use of water. This could potentially drive the recovery of resources that are important for clean energy applications and move us toward a circle economy for our society.\"Finding the best functional molecular groupsCreating such a device could have wide-ranging implications. It could help remove lead from water to create safer drinking water, and it could help with the re-use of water by trapping phosphorus and lithium from a water supply, then releasing the phosphorus for use in fertilizer and the lithium for use in clean energy technologies.Current technologies don't have the ability to selectively separate trace amounts of different ions within water, or can only do so at high cost. While some technologies can separate metals, they cannot fully distinguish one kind of metal ion from another. This is important, since while lead should be removed from drinking water, another metal, calcium, should be left in water, since it is beneficial for human health.Credit: Argonne National LaboratoryCDIs have shown promise in removing selected metal ions by using carbon materials like graphene oxide in their electrodes. To improve these devices, the UChicago-Argonne team needed to better understand the interaction between molecules and ions at the surface of the device's electrodes.Using modeling and machine learning, Chan and her team worked to understand how altering functional molecular groups\u2014specific groups of atoms that have their own characteristics\u2014on the electrode surface would affect the selectivity and removal of metal ions.\"Using computer models, we can understand and select functional groups at a molecular level. Using machine learning models, and we can broaden the search to a number of different molecules that are potentially viable,\" Chan said.The team ultimately found functional groups that could attach to the graphene oxide as well as selectively adsorb different types of ions from the water. Their predictions were experimentally validated by Chen, showing that the device could much more efficiently remove lead from water with these new functional groups.At Argonne, Benmore used the powerful Advanced Photon Source, a high-energy X-ray, to understand the structure of lead in water samples and better understand the interaction between the CDI and the lead. \"These were based on experiments done back in the 80s, and no one has really studied ions in water since, so we were really able to pick up on a lot of very old but important work and really apply new methods towards it,\" he said.Next the team plans to test its device using other metal ions, including lithium and cobalt. The project benefitted from early funding from UChicago Joint Task Force Initiative, which helps Argonne and Fermilab achieve mission success by opening channels of frequent communication and collaboration across institutions.\"The UChicago Joint Task Force Initiative support has been critical for this research project,\" Chen said. \"I think this project has fostered collaboration between UChicago and Argonne researchers, which is really very impactful because we are going to work together for this project as well as future projects.\" Provided byUniversity of ChicagoCitation:New technology more efficiently removes heavy metals from water (2023, April 27)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-technology-efficiently-heavy-metals.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Methanol is a potential feedstock for biomanufacturing since it's easily obtained in an environmentally friendly manner. But it is still challenging to construct a microbial cell factory for methanol-based bioproduction due to the toxicity of methanol and its complex cellular metabolism.       Recently, a research group led by Prof. Zhou Yongjin from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has engineered yeast Ogataea polymorpha for efficient production of fatty alcohols from sole methanol by coupling peroxisomal metabolism.The study was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on March 13.Fatty alcohols are widely used as detergents, emulsifiers, and emollients in personal care products, such as soaps, shampoos and creams. Microbial production from methanol might provide an efficient and sustainable route for supplying fatty alcohols. However, due to the toxicity of methanol and formaldehyde (the oxidative intermediate of methanol), the overproduction of fatty alcohols in microbial cell factories is hindered.In this study, the researchers observed compromised fatty alcohol production when constructing the cytosolic biosynthesis pathway in the methylotrophic yeast Ogataea polymorpha. The peroxisomal compartmentalization improved fatty alcohol production by coupling the cellular metabolism and product biosynthesis.Furthermore, the enhancing supply of precursor and cofactor in peroxisome improved the cellular fitness and enabled high-level production of fatty alcohol (up to 3.6 g/L).\"This work provides a feasible engineering strategy to improve methanol biotransformation toward sustainable production of fatty alcohols,\" said Prof. Zhou.

  "text": "Artificial intelligence can generate poems and essays, create responsive game characters, analyze vast amounts of data and detect patterns that the human eye might miss. Imagine what AI could do for drug discovery, traditionally a time-consuming, expensive process from the bench to the bedside.          Experts see great promise in a complementary approach using AI and structure-based drug discovery, a computational method that relies on knowledge of 3D structures of biological targets.We recently caught up with Vsevolod \"Seva\" Katritch, associate professor of quantitative and computational biology and chemistry at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience. Katritch is the co-director of the Center for New Technologies in Drug Discovery and Development (CNT3D) at the USC Michelson Center and the lead author of a new review paper published in Nature. The paper, co-authored by USC research scientist Anastasiia Sadybekov, describes how computational approaches will streamline drug discovery.We're on the cusp of major advances in drug discovery. What brings us to this moment?There has been a seismic shift in computational drug discovery in the last few years: an explosion of data availability on clinically relevant, human-protein structures\u2014and molecules that bind them, enormous chemical libraries of drug-like molecules, almost unlimited computing power and new, more efficient computational methods. The newest excitement is about AI-based drug discovery, but what's even more powerful is a combination of AI and structure-based drug discovery, with both approaches synergistically complementing each other.How has drug discovery been done in the past?Traditional drug discovery is mostly a trial-and-error venture. It's slow and expensive, taking an average of 15 years and $2 billion. There's a high attrition rate at every step, from target selection to lead optimization. The most opportunities for time and cost savings reside in the earlier discovery and preclinical stages.      What takes place in the early stage?Let's use a lock-and-key analogy. The target receptor is the lock, and the drug that blocks or activates this receptor is a key for this lock. (Of course, the caveat is that in biology nothing is black or white, so some of the working keys switch the lock better than others, and lock is a bit malleable too.)Here's an example. Lipitor, the bestselling drug of all time, targets an enzyme involved in the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. A receptor on the enzyme is the lock. Lipitor is the key, fitting into the lock and blocking the activity of the enzyme, triggering a series of events that decrease blood levels of bad cholesterol.Now, computational approaches allow us to digitally model many billions and even trillions of virtual keys and predict which ones are likely to be good keys. Only a few dozen of the best candidate keys are chemically synthesized and tested.This sounds much more efficientIf the model is good, this process yields better results than traditional trial-and-error testing of millions of random keys. This reduces the physical requirements for synthesis of compounds and testing them more than thousandsfold, while often arriving at better results, as demonstrated by our work and work of many other groups working in this field.Can you explain the difference between the two main computational approaches, structure-based and AI-based?Following the lock-and-key analogy, the structure-based approach takes advantage of our detailed understanding of the lock's structure. If the 3D, physical structure of the lock is known, we can use virtual methods to predict the structure of a key that matches the lock.The machine learning, or AI-based approach, works best when many keys are already known for our target lock or other similar locks. AI can then analyze this mixture of similar locks and keys and predict the keys that are most likely to fit our target. It does not need exact knowledge of the lock structure, but it needs a large collection of relevant keys.Thus, the structure-based and AI-based approaches are applicable in different cases and complement each other.Are there any computational limits to this process?When testing billions and trillions of virtual compounds on cloud computers, computational costs themselves can become a bottleneck. A modular, giga-scale screening technology allows us to speed up and reduce cost dramatically by virtually predicting good parts of the key, combine them together, sort of building the key from several parts. For a 10 billion-compound library, this drops the computational costs from millions of dollars to hundreds, and it allows further scale-ups to trillions of compounds. More information:Anastasiia V.

  "question_squad": " What is the most widely produced chemical in the world?",
  "answer_squad": " Ammonia",
  "text": "Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most widely produced chemicals in the world, with production at more than 187 million tons in 2020. About 85% of it is used to produce nitrogenous fertilizers, while the rest is used for refining petroleum, manufacturing a wide range of other chemicals, and creating synthetic fibers such as nylon. However, all this comes at a high energy cost.          Currently, most of the ammonia is produced using the conventional Haber-Bosch process, which requires combining nitrogen and hydrogen at high temperatures (400\u2013450\u00b0C) and pressures (200 atmospheres). As a result, scientists are actively seeking catalysts that can reduce the energy requirements for ammonia production and make synthesis more sustainable.Ruthenium (Ru), a noble metal, has been the primary candidate in this regard owing to its exceptional ability to absorb nitrogen at low temperatures. However, its high cost has prevented its widespread adoption in large-scale ammonia synthesis. While cobalt (Co) has been considered as a more cost-effective alternative, achieving the same catalytic activity as Ru at low temperatures has been difficult.To enhance the catalytic activity of Co, a team of researchers including Professor Masaaki Kitano at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan developed, in a recent study, a support material for Co nanoparticles. The material, a barium-containing oxyhydride electride called BaAl2O4-xHy, increases the catalytic activity of Co to a level comparable to that of Ru catalysts at low temperatures, and protects the H- ions and electrons from the effects of air and moisture. The breakthrough was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\"We attempted to develop a barium-containing oxyhydride electride, Ba2Al2O4-xHy to obtain a highly effective and chemically durable catalyst and unlock a new approach to designing novel inorganic electride materials and triggering their application in other fields,\" explains Prof. Kitano.How did the team achieve this feat? Put simply, BaAl2O4-xHy has a unique structure that promotes the dissociation of nitrogen over Co. The material exhibits a stuffed tridymite structure where AlO4 tetrahedra are linked to form a three-dimensional (3D) network structure, creating cage-like void spaces between the barium ions. These interstitial sites are like pockets for holding negative charges, enabling the material to donate electrons to Co and facilitate the breakdown of nitrogen molecules into nitrogen adatoms.To improve the electron-donating ability of the material, the researchers introduced electrons to the interstitial sites by replacing the O2- lattice ions with H- ions (O2- (framework)+ \u00bd H2 = H- (framework) + 1/2 O2 + e- (cage)). The introduction of H- ions not only improved the electron-donating ability of the BaAl2O4 but also facilitated the desired reduction of nitrogen to ammonia.By promoting both the cleavage of N2 and its subsequent reduction to ammonia, the Co/Ba2Al2O4-xHy catalyst could produce more than 500 mmol of ammonia per gram of cobalt per hour, a record value for Co-based catalysts. Moreover, compared to conventional Co catalysts, which typically have activation energies for ammonia synthesis exceeding 100 kJ/mole, the proposed catalyst demonstrated an activation energy of just 48.9 kJ/mole.Further, the stuffed tridymite structure was durable and reusable, with the AlO4-based tetrahedra framework shielding the lattice H- ions and electrons from oxidation. Finally, after exposing the Co/BaAl2O4-xHy to air, the researchers could recover up to 95% of its original activity by simply heating it in hydrogen.With its good chemical stability, enhanced catalytic activity, and high reusability, the Co/BaAl2O4-xHy catalyst shows great promise for synthesizing ammonia at low temperatures. \"This novel inorganic electride offers a new approach to developing highly effective and stable Ru-free catalysts for green ammonia synthesis,\" concludes Prof. Kitano.

  "text": "Researchers at Tokyo Tech have discovered hidden chemical order of the Mo and Nb atoms in disordered Ba7Nb4MoO20, by combining state-of-the-art techniques, including resonant X-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. This study provides valuable insights into how a material's properties, such as ionic conduction, can be heavily influenced by its hidden chemical order. These results would stimulate significant advances in materials science and engineering.          Determining the precise structure of a crystalline solid is a challenging endeavor. Materials properties such as ion conduction and chemical stability, are heavily influenced by the chemical (occupational) order and disorder. However, the techniques that scientists typically use to elucidate unknown crystal structures suffer from serious limitations.For instance, X-ray and neutron diffraction methods are powerful techniques to reveal the atomic positions and arrangement in the crystal lattice. However, they may not be adequate for distinguishing different atomic species with similar X-ray scattering factors and similar neutron scattering lengths.To tackle this issue, a research team led by Professor Masatomo Yashima of Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) in Japan sought to develop a novel and more powerful approach to analyze the order and disorder in crystals. They combined four different techniques to analyze the crystal structure of an important ionic conductor, Ba7Nb4MoO20.\"We chose Ba7Nb4MoO20 as Ba7Nb4MoO20-based oxides and related compounds are a class of emerging materials with interesting properties such as high ionic conduction and high chemical stability,\" explains Prof. Yashima. \"However, given that both the Mo6+ and Nb5+ cations have similar scattering powers, all structural analyses of Ba7Nb4MoO20 until now have been performed assuming complete Mo/Nb disorder.\"As described in their recent paper published in Nature Communications, the researchers used an approach that combined two experimental techniques, resonant X-ray diffraction (RXRD) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) aided by computational calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The NMR provided direct experimental evidence that the Mo atoms occupy only the crystallographic M2 site in Ba7Nb4MoO20, indicating the chemical order of Mo atoms.Next, the researchers used RXRD to quantify the occupancy factors of Mo and Nb atoms. They found that the occupancy factor of Mo atoms was 0.5 at the M2 site but zero at all other sites. Interestingly, the M2 site is close to the oxide-ion conducting, oxygen-deficient layer of Ba7Nb4MoO20. This suggests that the Mo atoms at the M2 site have key role in the high ion conduction of Ba7Nb4MoO20. Furthermore, DFT calculations indicated that the Mo ordering stabilizes Mo excess composition exhibiting high ionic conductivity. Positions, occupancy, and atomic displacements of protons and oxide ions were also determined by neutron diffraction.\"Our results demonstrate that the Mo order affects the material properties of Ba7Nb4MoO20,\" says Prof. Yashima. \"In this regard, our work represents a major advance in our understanding of the correlation between the crystal structure and the material properties of ionic conductors.\" Further, in contrast to single-crystal X-ray and neutron diffraction, the proposed approach can even be extended to other polycrystalline and powdered samples.Overall, the methodology presented in this study can open up new avenues for an in-depth analysis of chemical order/disorder in materials. In turn, this could lead to the development of physics, chemistry, and materials science and technology.

  "text": "Ammonia has been in the news because of its suitability as a hydrogen carrier and fuel, in addition to being a vital ingredient in fertiliser. Existing distribution networks and the ease of turning ammonia gas into a liquid make ammonia a cost-effective way to transport renewable energy. For a given volume, ammonia\u2014a molecule made up of three hydrogen atoms and one nitrogen atom\u2014carries about 50% more hydrogen atoms than hydrogen itself.          As ammonia contains only hydrogen and nitrogen, it does not emit carbon dioxide when used. If made using green hydrogen (produced with renewable energy), its production also does not emit carbon dioxide. Therefore, green ammonia could help achieve a net-zero world, particularly as a fuel for long-haul transport and heavy industry.Australia is well placed to develop a major renewable hydrogen export industry, potentially using green ammonia. Proposed projects include Cape Hardy, Collinsville, Australian Renewable Energy Hub, HyNQ, H2Tas and Gibson Island.Unfortunately, just because ammonia doesn't contain carbon, that doesn't make it good for the environment. It's a source of nitrogen pollution, which has many damaging environmental impacts. Despite Australia's natural advantage in producing green ammonia, we ironically have the biggest per capita nitrogen footprint in the world.Rarely, though, do green ammonia proponents critically assess its environmental sustainability beyond net zero claims.      Exceeding planetary boundariesThe Stockholm Resilience Centre defines nine processes that regulate Earth to support life as we know it. The boundaries of a \"safe operating space\" have been defined for each process.You probably won't be surprised to know climate change is one of the boundaries we have exceeded. You could be forgiven for thinking it has been our biggest impact on the planet. But that \"honour\" goes to biogeochemical flows of nutrients, mostly as a result of nitrogen fertilisers.Why? Well it comes back to ammonia.                Green ammonia produced using renewable energy can be used for power generation, energy storage and transport, fuel and fertiliser. Credit: Source: The Davos Agenda/World Economic Forum, CC BY-NC-ND Unbalancing the nitrogen cycleNitrogen makes up 78% of our atmosphere as dinitrogen gas (N\u2082). However, in this form it is inaccessible to living organisms.To support life, nitrogen must be converted into reactive forms such as ammonia. Once it reaches ecosystems, ammonia undergoes a series of chemical transformations. Eventually it breaks up again into N\u2082, and the cycle can start over again.For millions of years, the processes in each step of the cycle have been in balance. However, industrial fertiliser production in the 20th century has thrown this cycle out of balance.On the upside, ammonia has been a miracle chemical for growing food. An estimated 3.5 billion people are being fed thanks to chemical fertilisers. This means almost half of the world's population would go hungry if not for synthetic ammonia.The downside is too much reactive nitrogen is ending up in the environment\u2014more than twice as much as the recommended planetary boundary.In the case of excess nitrogen, crossing its planetary boundary has already had huge consequences. It has led to deterioration of ecosystems, photochemical smog, acid rain and health problems such as respiratory illnesses and cancer, algal blooms leading to fish kills such as the recent one at Menindee Lakes, damage to the Great Barrier Reef, and greenhouse gases much more potent than carbon dioxide.Producing additional ammonia as a renewable energy carrier could make these problems even worse. A problem of leakage                The Stockholm Resilience Centre planetary boundaries. (BII stands for Biodiversity Intactness Index. E/MSY is the number of extinctions per million species-years, a common measure of extinction rates. P stands for phosphorus and N for nitrogen.) Credit: Source: Azote for Stockholm Resilience Centre, based on analysis in Wang-Erlandsson et al 2022, CC BY-NC-ND Some estimate ammonia supply chains leak it into the environment at rates as high as 6%. However, research is limited. More widely understood natural gas supply chains may provide a ballpark figure of around 2.6%.Replacing fossil fuels with ammonia for long-haul trucks and shipping might reduce the carbon footprint of transport (which accounts for 37% of total carbon dioxide emissions). Yet, if 2.6% of ammonia leaked from the supply chain, we estimate this could triple the reactive nitrogen flux, further overshooting the planetary boundary. At a 6% leakage rate, it could be four times.We all know how climate change has been changing our world\u2014and that is at \"only\" 1.2 times the carbon planetary boundary. Using green ammonia as a renewable energy carrier could have an even greater impact on the nitrogen planetary boundary.A complement to ammoniaAnother renewable energy carrier can be made from green hydrogen: methanol. It's a molecule of four hydrogen atoms and single carbon and oxygen atoms.Like ammonia, methanol can be used as a fuel. It could replace petrochemical feedstocks used in industrial processes and manufacturing. Our research shows methanol could also enable biotechnology to better integrate with industrial processes.More significantly, methanol doesn't affect the nitrogen cycle. As long as it is made using a renewable source of carbon, such as carbon dioxide from direct air capture, there is a net zero impact on the environment. International Energy Agency projections show the United States has a greater emphasis on green methanol, while Australia and Europe are more focused on green ammonia.Environmental sustainability means more than net zero. In the case of green ammonia, holistic thinking is needed so we don't solve one problem only to make another worse.

  "text": "A versatile new foam material developed by researchers at the University of Georgia could significantly reduce health care-related infections caused by implanted medical devices\u2014or drastically improve cleanup efforts following environmental disasters like oil spills.          This research, titled \"Superhydrophobic and Conductive Foams with Antifouling and Oil-Water Separation Properties\" was published in the ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces January issue.Like a spongy Swiss Army knife, the porous three-dimensional foam is water-repellent\u2014meaning it resists blood, microbes and proteins, while also exhibiting antimicrobial and oil-water separation properties. Its versatility, functionality and relatively inexpensive production costs could make it a valuable resource for future clinicians and environmental remediation professionals alike.\"Making a multifunctional and versatile surface is an extremely challenging task,\" said Hitesh Handa, an associate professor in UGA's School of Chemical, Materials and Biomedical Engineering. \"You can find a surface that is only antimicrobial, or you can find one that can only prevent blood clotting. To be able to fabricate materials that are anticlotting, antimicrobial and antifouling is a significant improvement on current standards.\"The material is a coarse foam with a pair of added fillers: hydrophobic (water-repellent) electrically conductive graphene nanoplatelets and hydrophobic bactericidal copper microparticles. In addition to repelling water, their inclusion created a coarse surface that facilitated high oil adsorption capacity and the copper, a known toxin to bacterial cells, added antimicrobial properties to the surface itself.Credit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2023). DOI: 10.1021/acsami.2c22180Studies of its effectiveness yielded positive results.Using E. coli as a test bacterium, researchers found that the material resulted in a 99.9% bacterial reduction over a simple polymer. While that doesn't mean that all bacteria had been removed from the solution, it is a significant improvement that Handa thinks could improve health outcomes for many of the more than 500,000 patients who endure health care-related infections from medical implants each year.\"Current medical devices are prone to contamination,\" Handa said. \"When you put any medical device into the body, proteins are the first thing to stick to a surface, and they act like a glue that allows blood or bacteria to adhere. So, if we can stop the protein adsorption, half the battle is won.\"      Likewise, a series of tests demonstrated the material's high capacity for separating water and other oil-based pollutants. By placing a 3D sponge made from this surface into a variety of water mixtures\u2014chloroform, hydrochloric acid and other organic particles\u2014researchers were able to show its ability to absorb and remove the organic pollutants from the water, while also killing bacteria in the water itself.At scale, the material could prove impactful in environmental cleanup from oil spills or other similar scenarios.The idea follows a phenomenon called the lotus effect, which refers to self-cleaning properties that are a result of ultrahydrophobicity exhibited by the lotus flower. This has long been a model for the fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces that have proven effective at cleaning, antifogging and antifouling. Past design strategies, however, have fallen short due to a lack of functionality and scalability.\"The versatility is the key here,\" said Mark Garren, a co-author on the paper and doctoral student in Handa's lab. \"The multifunctional properties are what inspired this, then developing that and showcasing all of its abilities.\"Going forward, the primary goal for researchers is to apply the surface to medical devices and demonstrate its effectiveness before moving on to non-human animal trials, and eventually, testing in humans. Facing less rigorous safety standards, the surface may be more readily deployable in the environmental cleanup use cases.

  "text": "For the rational design of new material compounds, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying their synthesis. Analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance and spectroscopy are usually employed to study such mechanisms in molecular reactions. However, reaction pathways governing the formation of solid-state crystalline compounds remain poorly understood.          This is partly due to the extreme temperatures and inhomogeneous reactions observed in solid-state compounds. Further, the presence of numerous atoms in solid crystalline compounds hinders precise analysis. Developing new techniques that can circumvent these challenges is, therefore, necessary.More recently, in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques have been used for investigating reactions occurring in crystalline phases. Owing to their high speed and temporal resolution, synchrotron XRD measurements provide access to reaction data within extremely short time windows (few hundred milliseconds). This makes the technique promising for capturing data pertaining to short-lived intermediate reaction phases.Now, a group of researchers from Japan have used such a state-of-the-art synchrotron XRD technique to report the topochemical solid-gas reduction mechanisms in layered perovskite. The study was led by Associate Professor Takafumi Yamamoto from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) and published in the journal Advanced Science.\"We used Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4,a Ruddlesden-Popper type layered perovskite, owing to its efficient oxygen storage ability. Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 undergoes reversible and fast topochemical redox reactions under O2 and H2 and shows excellent performance as an environmental catalyst material,\" explains Dr. Yamamoto.His collaborators had previously observed that doping Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 with Palladium (Pd) significantly increases the oxygen release rate while decreasing the release temperature. Based on these observations, the team investigated the reaction pathways and structural evolution of this perovskite during the solid-gas reduction.The team began by preparing a pristine sample and a Pd-loaded sample of Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4. They then used high-speed synchrotron XRD to monitor them as they underwent fast oxygen deintercalation (reduction).The analyses revealed that the reduction of pristine Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 proceeded via thermodynamically stable phases, with pristine Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 undergoing gradual single-phase structural evolution during its reduction.In contrast, the reduction of Pd-loaded Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 involved nonequilibrium intermediate phases, a drastically different pathway. It first transformed into a dynamically-disordered phase for a few seconds and then rearranged itself via a first-order transition to reach the final ordered and stable state.Additionally, Pd metal particles on the Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 surface significantly accelerated the oxygen deintercalation reaction of Pd-loaded Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 relative to that of pristine Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4.Dr. Yamamoto adds, \"The change in reaction dynamics following the loading of Sr3Fe2O7-\u03b4 with Pd demonstrates that surface treatment can be used to manipulate reaction processes in a crystalline material.\"In summary, these findings suggest that the synchrotron XRD technique can be leveraged to study reaction pathways in solid-state compounds as well as identify their rate-determining steps. This, in turn, could help optimize the reaction pathway for the rational design of high-performance functional materials.

  "text": "This study was carried out under the leadership of Dr. Ming-Liang Tong (Key Laboratory of Bioinorganic and Synthetic Chemistry of Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry, Sun Yat-Sen University) and Dr. Shiping Yang (College of Chemistry and Materials Science, Shanghai Normal University).          Hai-Ling Wang from Sun Yat-Sen University was responsible for the synthesis of highly stable spherical clusters (Ho32 and Gd32), analysis of high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS), analysis of solution behavior and assembly mechanism.Donglin Liu from Shanghai Normal University conducted in vivo and in vitro toxicity and magnetic resonance imaging tests and analyzes on Gd32. Due to the highly exposed metal centers, high-nuclear lanthanide clusters are usually easily attacked by solvent molecules in solution and lose their stability, which limits their application in solution.Based on the ligand-protected metal cluster core strategy, the research team designed and synthesized spherical high-nuclear lanthanide clusters with high stability and excellent solubility in organic solvents or aqueous solutions. These properties are particularly striking in the reported examples of lanthanide clusters. A large number of organic ligands in the periphery tightly wrap the cluster core to ensure the stability of the spherical cluster in solution.At present, the MRI contrast agents used clinically are mainly mononuclear gadolinium chelates, which show unsatisfactory imaging contrast due to their low Gd content. According to the SBM theory, increasing the content of Gd in the molecule can effectively increase the relaxation rate of CAs.The nanocluster Gd32 with highly aggregated Gd in the molecule has a T1 relaxation rate as high as 265.87 mM\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 at a magnetic field strength of 1 T, which is much higher than that of CA Gd-DTPA (4.55 mM\u22121\u00b7s\u22121, 1 T) currently used clinically. This surprising discovery prompted the research team to further explore the toxicity of Gd32 in vitro and in vivo, and these results indicated that Gd32 has great potential as a new type of CAs.Next, the research team made an in-depth comparison of the MRI imaging effects of Gd32 and Gd-DTPA in aqueous solution, in cells, and in mice with 4T1 tumor models. There is no doubt that Gd32 is superior to Gd-DTPA.These experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of ligand-protected metal cluster core strategy to construct highly stable lanthanide clusters, and provide a new way to construct low-dose novel Gd-based MRI contrast agents.The research is published in the journal National Science Review.

  "answer_squad": " BCL6",
  "text": "Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, have created a compound that destroys a protein involved in driving cancers, including B-cell lymphoma.          The 'molecular glue'-type degrader could ultimately, with further research, be developed into a cancer drug, and will also be a powerful tool to study cancer biology.It's an example of an innovative approach to drug discovery known as protein degradation, that aims to target cancer by taking advantage of the cell's natural disposal system to remove proteins that can cause disease.In a new study, the research team describes how the degrader selectively sticks to the BCL6 protein\u2014a protein which B-cell lymphoma cells need to survive\u2014and tags it to be destroyed.BCL6 binds to the DNA and regulates genes that are involved in cell division and cell death. The protein is mutated in many cancers and finding a way to inhibit or reduce its levels could be a potential way to supress their growth.An innovative discoveryThe researchers sought to discover compounds that disrupt the function of the BCL6 protein and inhibit lymphoma cell growth. Their earlier work led to the identification of several compounds that had the potential to be developed further as BCL6 inhibitors.The team observed that some of the inhibitors they created also had the extra ability to degrade the BCL6 protein. These previously reported small-molecule degraders were able to fully deplete BCL6 in cells, but they had low solubility in water which made it difficult to dose sufficient amounts of the compound in animal models to keep the BCL6 levels down.In their new paper, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the team build on their previous findings to report the first BCL6 molecular glue-type degrader with suitable properties to test in animal models.By understanding what features of the molecule were needed to give the degrader effect, the team was able to create a potent compound that can bind to BCL6 more tightly and has improved water solubility, enabling sustained degradation of the protein in tumors in mice.The new compound had a modest effect on BCL6 levels in studies in mice\u2014with tumors growing significantly slower in the presence of the drug than in control tumors that received no drug.Although the preliminary results in mice were modest, they suggest that BCL6-targeted molecular glue-type degraders could help control tumor growth in lymphomas in combination with other therapies.The drug's ability to cause sustained depletion of BCL6 also makes it a very powerful tool to study BCL6 biology.      How do molecular glue-type degraders work?Protein turnover is a basic process that occurs in cells. It is controlled by the ubiquitin proteasome system, where specialized enzymes, including a family of proteins called the E3 ubiquitin ligases, recognize defective proteins and tag them with a small regulatory protein called ubiquitin.Once tagged with ubiquitin, another part of the system detects it and takes the tagged protein to the proteasome\u2014a protein complex that breaks down unnecessary or damaged proteins.Molecular glue-type degraders are small compounds that facilitate interactions between a target protein and the ubiquitin proteasome system. They act in a different way to more traditional 'small molecule' drugs, which bind to a specific site on a protein and block its function.While many small molecule drugs have been hugely successful cancer treatments, the protein degradation approach offers the hope of new therapies that hit currently 'undruggable' targets and potentially have long-lasting effects by completely removing proteins from cells.Complex chemistryStudy co-leader Dr. Benjamin Bellenie, senior staff scientist in the ICR's Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery, said, \"One interesting feature of our BCL6 project was that the initial compound we discovered from our screen had low solubility, which is not an ideal feature for drugs.\"\"With further investigations, we realized that the component contributing to low solubility was also giving the compound its 'glue-like' characteristic. This made it very challenging to optimize the molecule as any changes to improve its solubility often resulted in loss of its ability to stick to the target effectively.\"\"So we're thrilled to announce our discovery of a set of new molecular glue-type degraders for BCL6, which drives cancers including lymphoma. Our project was a delicate balance of optimizing solubility of our candidate compounds without losing potency, and ultimately, we were able to create a compound that can bind BCL6 very tightly and form a 'glued complex' even at low concentrations.\"Study co-leader Professor Swen Hoelder, head of chemistry at the ICR, said, \"We're very excited by the potential of protein degradation to deliver new drugs that could make a big difference in cancer treatment, and that's why we founded our Centre for Protein Degradation here at the ICR. I'm pleased to announce the discovery of our new molecular glue-type degrader of BCL6 in this new study, which is also a great example of creative science in a cutting-edge, innovative field in cancer drug discovery.\" More information:Rosemary Huckvale et al, Improved Binding Affinity and Pharmacokinetics Enable Sustained Degradation of BCL6 In Vivo, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (2022).

  "answer_race": " a new way to improve the stability of plastic materials",
  "question_squad": " What is the main cause of plastic degradation?",
  "answer_squad": " atmospheric oxygen",
  "text": "Plastic materials are prone to degradation by atmospheric oxygen. These auto-oxidation reactions occur at ambient temperature but become especially relevant during melt processing. Adding antioxidants to the polymers results in a pronounced slowing-down of the oxidation processes. Only in this way, the production of plastic parts by injection molding, for example, is possible.          Developing new plastic grades is accompanied by lengthy experimental procedures to optimize the antioxidant content. For Fraunhofer Institute for Structural Durability and System Reliability, these online rheological investigations are a promising method for accelerating the development process.AntioxidantsOrganic matter, and therefore also plastics, degrade by auto-oxidation when in contact with air. This degradation is initiated by elevated temperature or light and propagates as a radical chain reaction that causes cleavage of the polymer chains. The latter are primarily attacked by the OH radical resulting in the formation of hydroperoxide moieties. These triggers follow-up reactions leading to regeneration of the OH-radical.For optimum protection of the polymer, two different types of antioxidants must be added. The primary antioxidant, often containing a phenolic structure, quenches the OH-radical. Secondary antioxidants consist of sterically hindered alkyl-derivatives of functional groups, such as phosphites or thioethers. These react with the hydroperoxide without OH formation. Both types of antioxidant therefore act in a synergistic way. A typical commercially available stabilizer package containing both antioxidants in equal amounts was used in the described experiments.Studying process stabilizationCommercially available virgin plastic grades are typically equipped with appropriate stabilizer packages ready for use. For the sake of resource efficiency and economy, the optimum content of the process stabilizer must be determined during the development of new plastic grades. Processing of used plastics to recyclates faces the same problem because the stabilizers have been regularly depleted during the previous life cycle.Compounding the mill charge to recyclates to be used for example in injection molding, requires adding stabilizers adjusted to the respective type of plastics and its stage of aging. The traditional way to optimize the stabilizer content is based on compounding a series containing varying amounts of antioxidants. The compounds are then characterized offline by means of different tests, such as the melt volume rate (MVR, DIN 1133-1) or the oxidative induction time (OIT, ASTM D3895-19). First reliable results are obtained only after the compounding step.Online characterization offers new potentialResearchers at Fraunhofer LBF are working to obtain an indication regarding the efficacy of the actual stabilizer content during the compounding step. To this end, the viscosity of the melt is used as a recorded response while varying the recipe. This is realized by incorporating an online rheometer behind the screw tips of a twin screw extruder to measure the flow curves of the shear as well as the elongational viscosity.The first experiments were carried out on a minimally stabilized virgin polypropylene (PP).The amount of stabilizer added was varied at selected screw speeds. The reduced process-related degradation is immediately reflected in an increase in viscosity in the flow curves. Above a certain additive level there is no further increase in viscosity. This means that for the actual processing conditions, the stabilizer concentration has reached the limit above which no further improvement can be achieved.Thus, online rheology provides the formulation developer with valuable information regarding the efficacy of a processing stabilizer during compounding.Furthermore, the flow curves of the different polymers are not identical. The information content of a flow curve is therefore much higher than that of a single numerical value from an MVR measurement. In addition, the flow curves of the elongational viscosity can be included in the evaluation. Supported by an appropriate AI-based system, online rheology appears to be a very promising tool in implementing stabilization during the production of recyclates with the ability of real-time adjustment to the aging stage of the mill charges.

  "text": "Development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has been rapid, but the rise of variants forces scientists to frequently modify treatments. Ideally, therapies would target mutation-resistant viral proteins, but this has proven difficult. Researchers reporting in ACS Central Science, however, have now developed a system that directly targets and degrades the viral RNA genome, reducing infection in mice. The method could be adapted to fight off many viruses, as well as treat various diseases.          Vaccines and antiviral drugs typically target proteins critical to viral infection and replication. This targeting induces evolutionary pressure for the virus to mutate, however, reducing the effectiveness of existing treatments and requiring development of new vaccines and drugs.To get around this issue, researchers have turned to targeting highly conserved structures within the viral RNA genome. Other groups have linked small molecule RNA binders to ribonuclease L ligands (RIBOTACs), creating degraders that relied on ribonuclease expression within cells, which varied across tissues.Avoiding this dependency, Gon\u00e7alo J. L. Bernardes, Konstantinos Tzelepis, Sigitas Mikutis and colleagues showed that attaching imidazole to RNA could degrade the nucleic acid, so they wondered whether attaching imidazole to an RNA-binding molecule would result in targeted degradation.To accomplish this, the team used pyridostatin (PDS), which binds to G-quadruplex (G4) RNA structures, and MTDB, which binds to betacoronaviral pseudoknots, as the RNA-binding molecules. The researchers then appended each compound with a flexible linker and imidazole and called these molecules proximity-induced nucleic acid degraders (PINADs). By bringing imidazole into close proximity to the RNA, both PINADs degraded SARS-CoV-2 RNA.In addition, the compounds were effective when tested in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and its alpha and delta variants. Importantly, when the researchers gave the MTDB degrader to mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, viral load was reduced, as were levels of a biomarker of viral infection and replication.The researchers say that their system should allow any RNA-binding small molecule to be converted to a PINAD, so that it could someday be used to target and destroy other disease-related RNAs. This list could include disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or Huntington's disease, targeting the mRNAs of misfolded proteins that have otherwise proven difficult to target.

  "answer_squad": " Period",
  "text": "New research from a multidisciplinary team helps to illuminate the mechanisms behind circadian rhythms, offering new hope for dealing with jet lag, insomnia and other sleep disorders.          Using innovative cryo-electron microscopy techniques, the researchers have identified the structure of the circadian rhythm photosensor and its target in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), one of the major organisms used to study circadian rhythms. The research, \"Cryptochrome-Timeless Structure Reveals Circadian Clock Timing Mechanisms\" published April 26 in Nature.The research focused on fruit fly cryptochromes, key components of the circadian clocks of plants and animals, including humans. In flies and other insects, cryptochromes, activated by blue light, serve as the primary light sensors for setting circadian rhythms. The target of the cryptochrome photosensor, known as \"Timeless\" (TIM), is a large, complex protein that could not previously be imaged and thus its interactions with the cryptochrome are not well understood.Circadian rhythms work via what are basically genetic feedback loops. The researchers found that the TIM protein, along with its partner, the Period (PER) protein, act together to inhibit the genes that are responsible for their own production. With suitable delays between the events of gene expression and repression, an oscillation in protein levels is established.This oscillation represents the \"the ticking of the clock and seems to be fairly unique to the circadian rhythm,\" said senior author Brian Crane, the George W. and Grace L. Todd Professor and chair of chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences.Blue light, Crane said, changes the chemistry and structure of cryptochrome's flavin cofactor, which allows the protein to bind the TIM protein and inhibit TIM's ability to repress gene expression and thereby reset the oscillation.Much of the hard work of the study went into figuring out how to produce the complex of cryptochrome-TIM so it could be studied, because TIM is such a large, unwieldy protein, Crane said. To achieve their results, first author Changfan Lin, M.S. '17, Ph.D. '21, modified the cryptochrome protein to improve the stability of the cryptochrome-TIM complex and used innovative techniques to purify the samples, making them suitable for high-resolution imaging.      \"These new methods allowed us to obtain detailed images of the protein structures and gain valuable insights into their function,\" said Lin, a Friedrich's Ataxia Research Alliance Postdoctoral Fellow at the California Institute of Technology. \"This research not only deepens our understanding of circadian rhythm regulation but also opens up new possibilities for developing therapies targeting related processes.\"Co-author Shi Feng, a doctoral student in the field of biophysics, did much of the cryo-electron microscopy work. Cristina C. DeOliveira, a doctoral student in the field of biochemistry and molecular and cell biology, was also a co-author.One unexpected result from the study sheds light on how DNA damage is repaired in a cell. Cryptochromes are closely related to a family of enzymes involved in repairing damage to DNA, called photolyases. Crane said the research \"explains why these families of proteins are closely related to each other, even though they're doing quite different things\u2014they're making use of the same molecular recognition in different contexts.\"The study also offers an explanation for the genetic variation of flies that allows them to adapt to higher latitudes, where days are shorter in the winter and it's cooler. These flies have more of a certain genetic variant that involves a change in the TIM protein, and it wasn't clear why the variation could help them. The researchers found that because of how the cryptochrome binds TIM, the variation reduces the affinity of TIM for the cryptochrome. The interaction between the proteins is then modulated and the ability of light to reset the oscillation is changed, thus altering the circadian clock and extending the period of the fly's dormancy, which helps it survive the winter.\"Some of the interactions that we see here in the fruit fly can be mapped onto human proteins,\" Crane said. \"This study may help us understand key interactions between components that regulate sleep behavior in people, such as how the critical delays in the basic timing mechanism get built into the system.\"Another exciting finding, said Lin, was the discovery of an important structural area in TIM, called the \"groove,\" which helps explain how TIM enters the cell nucleus. Previous studies had identified some factors involved in this process, but the exact mechanism remained unclear. \"Our research provided a clearer understanding of this phenomenon,\" Lin said.

  "text": "Researchers at the College of Environmental Science and Engineering of Nankai University have introduced a new strategy to realize rapid biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) measurement by using the competitive switching of electrotrophic and heterotrophic pathways of facultative bacteria. The findings were published in Water Research under the title \"Switchover of Electrotrophic and Heterotrophic Respirations Enables the Biomonitoring of Low Concentration of BOD in Oxygen-rich Environment.\"          The research team isolated and obtained a strain of Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 with both electrotrophic and heterotrophic respiration from microbial electroactive biofilms (EABs) over a period of five years. The findings of research reveal that this bacterium can respire with a polarized graphite electrode in the absence of a degradable organic carbon source, and the current generated at this point can be used as the baseline of sensors.When degradable pollutants are present in the water, RAG-1 swiftly switches to heterotrophic respiration, resulting in a decrease in current. The decrease in current value is proportional to the concentration of organic pollutants. Based on this, the research team developed a novel bio-cathode BOD sensor, which has a linear response to common pollutants such as organic acids, sugars, proteins, humic acids, as well as mixtures such as low-concentration domestic sewage and lake sediments. It realizes sensitive monitoring of oxygen-rich and low-BOD water, with a test time of less than three hours.This study further explains the switchover mechanism of facultative electrotrophic bacteria's metabolic pathways and their adaptability and resilience to contaminated environment. Based on this new principle, the research team will develop more electrotrophic-heterotrophic microorganisms as sensing elements to support rapid BOD monitoring under complex environmental scenarios. This technique is expected to be used in water quality regulation for aquaculture, water quality monitoring for reclaimed water, and more.

  "text": "Plastics are everywhere in our daily lives, but not all plastics are created equal\u2014far from it.          Take, for instance, polyethylene terephthalate, a plastic used to make soda bottles and clothing fibers. Then there's high-density polyethylene, from which shampoo bottles, milk jugs and cutting boards are derived. Don't forget polystyrene for packaging, or low-density polyethylene, which gives us cling wrap and grocery bags.All of these are plastics, which are the most widely used types of polymers\u2014macromolecules made of repeating units of small molecules called monomers. Post-consumer plastics are almost always collected as a mixed stream of waste, and products are often manufactured from two or more types of plastics.The bad news is that these items, though all \"plastics,\" are chemically and physically incompatible, and there's no good industrial method for reusing or re-processing them into other useful products. That's why most of those \"recyclables\" you're throwing into bins every week are going to a landfill. Even after careful sorting and separation into individual plastics, mechanical recycling usually yields inferior products, termed down-cycling.Polymer chemists at Colorado State University have long been leaders in finding ways to tackle the environmental problems humans have created with plastics waste. Now, they've come up with fundamental new chemistry that seeds a creative solution to the challenge of recycling mixed-use plastics.Led by University Distinguished Professor Eugene Chen in the Department of Chemistry, and Tomislav Rovis and Sanat Kumar, professors at Columbia University (Rovis was formerly a faculty member at CSU), the team has devised a new chemical strategy that delivers specifically designed small molecules called universal dynamic crosslinkers into mixed plastic streams.These crosslinkers transform a former muck of unmixable materials into a viable new set of polymers, which can be turned into new, higher-value, re-processable materials, a process known as upcycling. The work is published in the journal Nature.Dynamic crosslinkersWhen heated and processed together with the dynamic crosslinkers added in small amounts, the mixed plastics are made compatible with each other through in-situ formation of a new material, called a multiblock copolymer.Kumar likened the block copolymers to soap molecules, which make water compatible with oily dirt molecules. \"In a similar way, these new types of dynamically formed 'soaps,' i.e. the block copolymers, compatibilize mixed plastics and make them usable as a new kind of material with useful properties.\"This new method of upcycling, which does not involve deconstructing or reconstructing any of the original polymers, introduces a potential solution for recapturing materials and energy endowed in post-consumer mixed plastics that typically end up in landfills.The team designed their crosslinkers and tested them on a variety of plastics, including samples of mixed polyethylene Ziploc bags and polylactide cups without prior purification or removal of additives or dyes, which are typically present in post-consumer plastic products. They combined their experiments with modeling studies to verify that the crosslinkers induce the formation of new multiblock copolymers.\"The system is so efficient, it compatibilizes three different polymers into a single new material,\" Rovis said.Multiple use cyclesThe researchers posit that their new strategy could help achieve the ultimate goal of reusing mixed plastic waste over multiple use cycles, Chen said.\"A key barrier is cost; we are talking about millions of tons of plastic waste, and you have to consider how many of these dynamic crosslinkers you need, although we currently need only less than 5% of the weight of the plastics in our upcycling process. Like many fundamental discoveries made in history, practical obstacles exist at the very beginning, but we are very excited about future potential.\" More information:Clarke, R.W. et al, Dynamic crosslinking compatibilizes immiscible mixed plastics, Nature (2023).

  "text": "Researchers have developed a new chemical process that is not limited to wind turbine blades but works on many different so-called fiber-reinforced epoxy composites, including some materials that are reinforced with especially costly carbon fibers.          This process could contribute to establishing a potential circular economy in the wind turbine, aerospace, automotive and space industries, where these reinforced composites, due to their light weight and long durability, are used for load-bearing structures.Being designed to last, the durability of wind turbine blades poses an environmental challenge. Wind turbine blades mostly end up at waste landfills when they are decommissioned, because they are extremely difficult to break down.If no solution is found, we will have accumulated 43 million tons of wind turbine blade waste globally by 2050.The newly discovered process is a proof-of-concept of a recycling strategy that can be applied to the vast majority of both existing wind turbine blades and those presently in production, as well as other epoxy-based materials.The results have just been published in Nature, and Aarhus University, together with the Danish Technological Institute, have filed a patent application for the process.Specifically, the researchers have shown that by using a ruthenium-based catalyst and the solvents isopropanol and toluene, they can separate the epoxy matrix and release one of the epoxy polymer's original building blocks, bisphenol A (BPA), and fully intact glass fibers in a single process.However, the method is not immediately scalable yet, as the catalytic system is not efficient enough for industrial implementation\u2014and ruthenium is a rare and expensive metal. Therefore, the scientists from Aarhus University are continuing their work on improving this methodology.\"Nevertheless, we see it as a significant breakthrough for the development of durable technologies that can create a circular economy for epoxy-based materials. This is the first publication of a chemical process that can selectively disassemble an epoxy composite and isolate one of the most important building blocks of the epoxy polymer as well as the glass or carbon fibers without damaging the latter in the process,\" says Troels Skrydstrup, one of the lead authors of the study.Troels Skrydstrup is a professor at the Department of Chemistry and the Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO) at Aarhus University.

  "text": "Safer and more effective blood thinners could be on the way following a groundbreaking discovery by researchers at UBC and the University of Michigan, published today in Nature Communications.          By combining their expertise in blood clotting systems and chemical synthesis, the researchers have designed a new compound called MPI 8 that offers the potential to prevent blood clots without any increased risk of bleeding\u2014a common side effect of existing blood thinners.\"The development of MPI 8 represents a major breakthrough in the field of blood clot prevention and treatment,\" said Dr. Jay Kizhakkedathu, a professor and Canada Research Chair at UBC's department of pathology and laboratory medicine and the UBC Centre for Blood Research. \"By targeting a specific molecule involved in clot formation without disrupting the natural clotting process, we've created a blood thinner that has proven safer and more effective in animal models, with enormous potential to improve human lives as well.\"Further research will be needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of MPI 8 in humans, but initial results offer hope for a new era in blood clot prevention and thrombosis treatment while serving as a testament to the power of collaboration in research medicine.Blood clots are a serious health concern affecting millions of people around the world. When left untreated, they can lead to life-threatening conditions such as deep vein thrombosis, heart attack, pulmonary embolism and stroke.Blood thinners, also known as anticoagulants or antithrombotic drugs, are essential in the treatment and prevention of blood clots but carry a significant risk of bleeding. This can cause complications and limit their use in some patients.Existing blood thinners such as heparin, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and warfarin work by targeting enzymes that are essential for blood clotting. However, they must be carefully dosed and monitored because disabling those enzymes threatens the normal clotting process required to heal wounds.UBC and Michigan researchers took an innovative approach to instead target polyphosphate, a molecule involved in blood clotting that accelerates the process but is not essential for it.\"Our thought was that polyphosphate might be a safer target to go after with an antithrombotic drug, because it would just slow these clotting reactions down\u2014even if we take out 100 percent of the action of the polyphosphate,\" said Dr. Jim Morrissey, a professor of biological chemistry and internal medicine at the University of Michigan whose work has illuminated the role of polyphosphate in blood clotting.\"We really had to come up with an extremely novel way to target it compared to the usual drugs that target clotting, and that's where the expertise of Dr. Kizhakkedathu's lab became so important.\"After building a library of potential molecules and screening them for their desired criteria, the Kizhakkedathu lab zeroed in on MPI 8. This unique molecule has \"smart\" binding groups with positive charges that are drawn to polyphosphate's negative charge. It will bind to polyphosphate and inhibit it while leaving the body's other negatively charged cells and proteins alone, eliminating toxic side effects.In preclinical studies, MPI 8 demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in preventing blood clots in mice without increasing bleeding risk. The drug showed no signs of toxicity, even at high doses.\"Not only does the drug show promise as a safer and more effective option for patients, but the design platform we used to create MPI 8 is flexible, potentially allowing for the development of additional compounds with similar properties and efficacy,\" said Dr. Chanel La, who worked on the project as a chemistry Ph.D. student in the Kizhakkedathu lab.\"Assuming our work continues to produce positive results, I would be very excited to get MPI 8 into an approved clinical trial and bring this drug closer to becoming a reality for patients in need.\" More information:Smart thrombosis inhibitors without bleeding side effects via charge tunable ligand design, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "Researchers have a new scientific tool called Polybot, combining the power of artificial intelligence with robotics. Potential applications include speeding up the discovery of wearable biomedical devices, materials for better batteries and more.          Today's wearable technologies like smart glasses and watches are just the start. The next generation of flexible electronics will be more efficient and sustainable, better able to monitor our health and treat certain diseases, and much more. They will be composed of electronic polymer materials\u2014a soft pliable substance that can conduct electricity.\"Just imagine the next generation of polymer electronics,\" said Jie Xu, assistant chemist at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory with a joint appointment in the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. \"They are not going to be rigid anymore.\"To hasten the discovery time, researchers at Argonne have a new tool, a self-driving laboratory called Polybot that automates aspects of electronic polymer research and frees scientists' time to work on tasks only humans can accomplish. This tool combines the computational power of artificial intelligence (AI) with the automation possible with robotics. It is housed in the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM), a DOE Office of Science user facility at Argonne.In an article published as the cover story in Chemistry of Materials, Xu and Henry Chan, a CNM assistant scientist, along with researcher Aikaterini Vriza, shared their vision on using self-driving laboratories for different types of materials research.Polybot is one of several autonomous discovery labs starting up at Argonne and other research organizations. While still in their infancy, their main purpose is to harness the power of AI and robotics to streamline experimental processes, save resources and accelerate the pace of discovery.The potential applications of Polybot extend far beyond biomedical devices, Xu said. They include materials for computing devices with brain-like features and new sensors for monitoring climate change. They also include new solid electrolytes that would eliminate the current liquid electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries, making them less likely to catch fire.Using Polybot, the CNM team is focusing on polymer electronics for energy-saving and medical purposes. These include devices that are recyclable or decompose after use.      Scientists usually prepare polymers for electronics by synthesizing polymer molecules with desired chemical structures, creating a solution with a mixture of many components. They then convert the solution into a thin layer of solid material. Layers of different compositions printed together serve as the basis for making different types of devices.To achieve targeted performance, the number of potential tweaks is overwhelming. They run from spiking the fabrication recipe with different formulations to varying the processing conditions. By conventional experimental means, such development can take years of intense labor. Polybot can greatly reduce the development time and cost.A typical experiment with Polybot begins by using AI and robots for different tasks. The automated system chooses a promising recipe for a polymer solution, prepares it and prints it as a very thin film at a selected speed and temperature. The system then hardens this film for an optimal length of time and measures key features, such as thickness and uniformity, as a quality check. Next, it assembles multiple layers together and adds electrodes to form a device.After that, Polybot measures the device's electrical performance. All the relevant data are automatically recorded and analyzed with machine learning and passed to the AI component. The AI then direct what experiments to do next. Polybot can also respond to feedback provided by users and data from the scientific literature.\"This is all done with minimal human intervention,\" Xu said.\"We have plans in place to expand the capabilities of our self-driving lab to take advantage of other Argonne scientific facilities,\" said Chan.Already, the properties of electronic devices fabricated in Polybot have been analyzed with a powerful X-ray beam. This was done by using an instrument with a robotic sample handler at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), a DOE Office of Science user facility at Argonne. That connection could be strengthened to take full advantage of the APS after its upgrade is complete in 2024.\"X-ray scattering analysis expands the Polybot's characterization down to the molecular level, revealing information about the orientation and packing of the molecules that can help speed up the search for the best materials with optimal performance,\" said Joseph Strzalka, a physicist in Argonne's X-ray Science division. \"We are working on bringing the Polybot's capabilities to an APS beamline so we can generate the large numbers of materials the APS upgrade will be capable of studying.\"\"We are excited at the prospect of leveraging the supercomputing capabilities at Argonne to enhance Polybot,\" Chan explained. \"The goal is to conduct physics-based simulations prior to, during and after an actual experiment to gain deeper insights into a material or device and provide better feedback to the AI.\" The team plans to utilize the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, a DOE Office of Science user facility, to perform the simulations. This will streamline the discovery process even further.With these capabilities and more, self-driving labs like Polybot have the potential to accelerate the discovery process from years to months. They also could reduce the cost of complex projects from millions to thousands of dollars.

  "text": "In the RUBIO project, 18 partners are turning the vision of a sustainable plastics industry into reality. Their goal is to use regionally available plant residues to create versatile, sustainable products that are recyclable and biodegradable. As part of the project, the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research IAP is developing new types of the bioplastic polybutylene succinate (PBS) so that it can be used for significantly more applications. Together with the company POLIFILM EXTRUSION GmbH, the Fraunhofer IAP has developed an initial commercial product.          Bioplastics are increasingly providing an alternative to petroleum-based plastics. These sustainable materials offer a number of advantages: They are made from renewable resources and help to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and CO2 emissions into the environment. They can be biodegradable and have processing properties comparable to those of classic petroleum-based plastics. Like classic plastics, bioplastics can be sorted, fractionated and recycled.Why aren't petroleum-based plastics simply replaced by bioplastics?Despite the high potential, there are a number of factors that prevent companies from manufacturing their products from bioplastics: Worldwide, there are only a few manufacturers offering bioplastics on the market. For plastics processors, this causes problems with ensuring supply, higher costs, and a too limited choice of different types of bioplastics to realize the wide range of possible applications.In addition, there is a need for technical improvement and it is often not clear for which specific applications bioplastics are suitable. Finally, bioplastics are currently often produced from sugarcane and corn\u2014potential food or feed sources, which could raise a kind of \"food or plastic\" discussion.New PBS types enable more diverse areas of applicationTherefore, the need for developments in this field is great. Experts from the Fraunhofer IAP are tackling these hurdles together with partners from science and industry in the project \"Regional Entrepreneurial Alliance for the Development of Value Added Chains for Technical Bioplastics in Central Germany,\" RUBIO.Thomas B\u00fcsse, who coordinates the joint project \"Processing\" at RUBIO and heads the Processing Pilot Plant for Biopolymers (located in Schwarzheide in Brandenburg, Germany) of Fraunhofer IAP, explains: \"Depending on the application or processing technology, the plastic used must be hard or soft, perhaps also high or low viscosity can be required. However, there are only three types of PBS on the market, and these are suitable only for a limited number of processing methods and applications.\"For this reason, the team in Dr. Antje Lieske's department \"Polymer Synthesis\" of Fraunhofer IAP in Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany, is developing entirely new types of PBS that can be processed using a much wider range of methods\u2014for instance from blow molding to injection molding. Thus, the researchers are also increasing the portfolio of possible applications.The know-how of the polymer specialists at the Fraunhofer IAP goes far beyond the mere development of synthesis processes for new types of bioplastics. In the synthesis pilot plant of the Fraunhofer Pilot Plant Center for Polymer Synthesis and Processing PAZ in Schkopau, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany the team led by Dr. Ulrich Wendler, head of the \"Synthesis and Product Development\" department at the Fraunhofer IAP, is transferring the results from the laboratory and pilot plant to an industrial pilot scale. The question of how the newly developed plastic types and blends can be thermoplastically processed is being intensively investigated in the processing pilot plant.Tests on biodegradability, printability, sealability or machinability are also carried out here\u2014criteria that the researchers can set individually at the customer's request. Recyclability is also tested in the RUBIO consortium. \"The important thing is that bioplastics can and must be recycled. Degradability only comes into play when large or small plastic particles are lost during use and thus end up in the environment,\" B\u00fcsse emphasizes.Within the framework of the RUBIO project Fraunhofer IAP and POLIFILM EXTRUSION GmbH have achieved a first success. The German company produces plastic films for various applications in the packaging, construction, agricultural, automotive and other sectors on more than 80 extrusion lines at its Wei\u00dfandt-G\u00f6lzau site in Saxony-Anhalt. The partners have developed a PBS film that can be used for shipping bags.\"This cooperation is an important step towards sustainability and allows us to offer products made from regional waste materials that are recyclable and additionally biodegradable if lost to the environment. Another advantage is the processing on common extrusion lines, so that nothing stands in the way of the triumphal march of PBS materials,\" explains Tobias Otto, Project Manager R&D at POLIFILM EXTRUSION GmbH.      No 'food-or-plastic' discussion due to regional plant residuesThe development of the new PBS film goes even further, because so far the bioplastic is not yet based on regional raw materials. But that will change in the further course of the cooperation. Plant residues from the region will be the raw material in the future.\"In principle, all materials that contain cellulose or lignocellulose can be used. This includes unrotted fermentation residues from biogas plants, residues from farms that occur in a variety of forms, or theoretically even waste from paper production,\" explains Thomas B\u00fcsse. Ideally, the use of regional residual materials has another advantage in the long term: Shorter transport routes can lead to lower prices and greater sustainability of the plastic products produced.

That's the premise of an ecofriendly disposable sensor, reported in  Analytical Chemistry, that can check levels of glucose and other biomarkers in saliva. Researchers say the easy-to-produce device could someday help doctors assess a range of conditions.          Wood is a renewable, biodegradable, natural material that is widely available at low cost, which makes it attractive for researchers who design electronics and sensors. However, this is challenging because the material isn't good at conducting electricity. One solution is to use wood as a passive substrate and then coat it with metals and carbon-based inks. Alternatively, high-power lasers can char specific regions on the wood, turning those spots into conductive graphite.But this complicated technique requires sophisticated and expensive instrumentation, an oxygen-free atmosphere and fire retardants. To develop a cheaper and easier process, Christos Kokkinos and colleagues turned to low-power diode lasers, which have already been successfully used to make polyimide-based sensors but haven't previously been applied to wooden electronics and electrochemical sensors.The team used a portable, low-cost laser engraver to create a pattern of conductive graphite electrodes on a wooden tongue depressor, without the need for special conditions. Those electrodes formed two electrochemical cells separated by lines drawn with a water-repellent permanent marker.The biosensor was then used to rapidly and simultaneously measure concentrations of nitrite and glucose in artificial saliva. Nitrite can reveal oral diseases, such as periodontitis, while glucose can serve as a diagnostic for diabetes. The researchers say these low-cost devices could be adapted to detect other saliva biomarkers and would be quick and easy to produce on-site at medical facilities.

  "text": "The combustion of oil, coal or natural gas produces carbon dioxide, or CO2. This notorious greenhouse gas is a major driver of global warming, but it is also a raw material. It is technically possible to convert CO2 into useful carbon compounds, a process which requires energy, water, suitable electrodes and special catalysts.          CO2 can be electrochemically converted to carbon monoxide, formate or methane, but also to ethylene, propanol, acetate and ethanol. However, industrial processes must be designed to be highly selective and extremely efficient to produce only the desired products and not a mixture of products.\"By electrolytically reducing CO2 to useful hydrocarbons, we can produce new fuels without using fossil resources. We thus are putting the CO2 back into the cycle, just like recycling,\" explains Dr. Matthew Mayer, leader of the Helmholtz Young Investigator Group \"Electrochemical Conversion\" at HZB. The electrical energy for the electrolysis can be provided by renewable energy from wind or solar, making the process sustainable.The zero-gap cell: a sandwich of many layersFrom school, we know electrolysis can be done in a simple beaker of water; a further development of this is the H-cell, which is shaped like the letter H. However, such cells are not suitable for industrial use. Instead, industrial electrolyzers are designed with a sandwich architecture consisting of several layers: On the right and left are the electrodes that conduct the current and are coated with catalysts, a copper-based gas diffusion layer that lets in the CO2 gas, and a separation membrane.The electrolyte (here supplied at the anode and called anolyte) consists of dissolved potassium compounds and allows ions to move between the electrodes. The membrane is designed to allow negatively charged ions to pass through and to block positively charged potassium ions.The problem: Potassium crystals Nevertheless, potassium ions from the electrolyte pass through the membrane and form tiny crystals at the cathode, clogging the pores. \"This shouldn't happen,\" says Flora Haun, a Ph.D. student in Matthew Mayer's team.Using scanning electron microscopy and other imaging techniques, the scientists were able to study the process of crystal formation at the cathode in detail. \"With energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, we were able to locate the individual elements and show exactly where potassium crystals were forming,\" Flora Haun explains.The more potassium the electrolyte contains, the more the cathode becomes clogged, the investigations showed. But there is no simple way to solve the problem: reducing the potassium concentration is good on the one hand, but bad on the other, since the reaction equilibrium also shifts: instead of the desired ethylene, carbon monoxide is produced.The electrolyte is the key\"The most important observation is that cations can still penetrate the anion exchange membrane, but to an extent that depends on the concentration of the electrolyte. And that with the concentration of the electrolyte we simultaneously regulate which products are formed from the CO2,\" says Dr. Gumaa El Nagar, a postdoctoral researcher in the team.\"In the next step, we want to use operando and in situ measurements using X-rays to find out in detail how ion migration in the cell affects the chemical reaction processes,\" says Matthew Mayer.The study is published in the journal Nature Communications.

  "text": "Researchers from the Institute of Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering at TU Graz and the Austrian Center of Industrial Biotechnology (ACIB) have developed a novel method for the production of central components of mRNA vaccines and applied for a patent.          In an article published in the journal Nature Communications, Bernd Nidetzky, Martin Pfeiffer and Andrej Ribar explain how they produced the essential vaccine ingredient pseudouridine by means of biocatalytic synthesis and thus created an alternative to the previous method of chemical synthesis.One process step is sufficientThis alternative offers some decisive advantages. The chemical synthesis of pseudouridine not only involves toxic reagents and rare raw materials, but is also very energy- and time-consuming due to the necessary four to eight process steps and cooling to minus 20 degrees.Biocatalysis, on the other hand, requires only one process step with four parallel reactions that take place at room temperature. In addition, only four enzymes are needed as catalysts (uridine phosphorylase, phosphopentose mutase, pseudouridine monophosphate glycosidase and phosphatase), and these can be produced quite easily with E.coli bacteria. Biocatalysis also produces no waste materials; the only waste is phosphate, but this is recycled again during the catalysis process.Another important advantage is efficiency. Since, in short, the chemical production of pseudouridine converts the naturally occurring uridine, which is less efficient for vaccines, there is no 100% yield during the conversion process. However, due to the smaller number of process steps, biocatalytic synthesis achieves a yield of 92 to 95%, compared to just 40% to 50% for the chemical processes published so far.Inspiration from natureThe researchers based the development of this new process on one of their earlier studies in which they discovered that the YeiN enzyme is a biocatalyst for the production of C-nucleotides. Since pseudouridine is the C-nucleoside of the RNA building block uridine, they had the idea of taking uridine, which can be produced in large quantities by means of bacterial fermentations, as a raw material and re-establishing the bond between its basic building blocks. The inspiration for this came from nature.Unlike pseudouridine, uridine has an N-glycosidic bond, which is cleaved into ribose-1-phosphate (sugar) and uracil during natural degradation in cells by means of the enzyme uridine phosphorylase. Then the enzyme phosphopentose mutase comes into play, which rearranges the ribose-1-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate, which is metabolized in the cells.This is followed by the application of the YeiN enzyme, which is used to link the ribose-5-phosphate and the uracil to pseudouridine-5-phosphate. Phosphatase is used to split off the phosphate from the pseudouridine and the goal is reached. Since pseudouridine is much less water-soluble than uridine, it simply crystallizes in the course of the reaction and can therefore be easily obtained by filtering the reaction supernatant.Production on a larger scale\"Our work shows that biocatalysis is a potent alternative to the chemical synthesis of C-nucleotides such as pseudouridine,\" explains Bernd Nidetzky, head of the Institute of Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering at TU Graz.\"We hope to implement the production on a larger scale soon and thus make pseudouridine available sustainably and cheaply in larger quantities. This could possibly also make the production of mRNA vaccines cheaper in the medium term, as potential partners from industry could implement our application quite promptly.\" More information:Martin Pfeiffer et al, A selective and atom-economic rearrangement of uridine by cascade biocatalysis for production of pseudouridine, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "Raman imaging offers a greater potential for detecting multiple enzyme activities than fluorescence imaging, demonstrate Tokyo Tech researchers by developing 9CN-rhodol-based activatable Raman probes using a novel mechanism for Raman signal activation. The strategy allows a synthesis of highly activatable Raman probes with high aggregation and multiplexing ability, making it a promising tool for extending the range of Raman probes for the detection of multiple enzyme activities in heterogeneous biological tissues.          The involvement of enzymes in a wide range of biological activities makes them ideal biomarkers for the detection of diseases. In fact, cancer-specific diagnostic technologies use fluorescence imaging for detecting upregulated cancer-associated enzymes in the affected cells. Moreover, since tumor tissues are heterogenous, detecting multiple enzyme activities simultaneously could allow precise cancer visualization and diagnosis. However, the inability to detect multiple enzyme activities can potentially limit the application of fluorescence imaging in heterogeneous tumor tissues and other complex biological phenomena.As an alternative, the narrower spectral width of Raman spectral imaging offers hope for multiplexing biological imaging with molecular probes. Over the years, several functional and activatable Raman probes (dyes) for detecting bioanalytes have been developed, but those for detecting enzyme activities have been limited. Further, the previous design strategies have failed to control the diffusion of enzyme-generated hydrolysis product of these probes, making it difficult to distinguish regions with target enzyme activity in tissues.Against this backdrop, a team of researchers from Japan led by Professor Mako Kamiya and Assistant Professor Hiroyoshi Fujioka of Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) recently reported, taking inspiration from aggregation-based fluorescent probes, a new molecular design strategy for the synthesis of activatable Raman probes based on 9CN-rhodol. Their study was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.Explaining the choice of rhodol derivatives for molecular scaffold, Prof. Kamiya says, \"Hiroyoshi found that rhodol derivatives with a nitrile group at the ninth position (9CN-rhodols) and a net charge of zero exhibit a single sharp Raman peak and have higher aggregation ability in aqueous solution than 9CN-pyronins with positive charge. Accordingly, we used 9CN-rhodol scaffold dyes to create Raman probes that can exhibit high sensitivity and undergo red shift in molecular absorption towards a region of resonant Raman effect and form aggregation upon interacting with the target enzymes.\"Accordingly, the team first synthesized 9CN-rhodol derivatives and selected two derivatives, 9CN-JR and 9CN-JCR, as candidates for designing the activatable Raman probes. They then tested the enzyme detection performance of both probes in live cells using a dual-color stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging technique. Of the two, 9CN-JCR emerged as the better and brighter probe for multiplexing.Next, the team isotope-labeled the nitril group of 9CN-JCR scaffold with Carbon-13 (13C) and Nitrogen-15 (15N) and then created two new isotope edited 9CN-JCR probes for \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzymes. The new set of 9CN-JCR-based probes was then able to simultaneously detect the activities of all these enzymes in the live cell culture.Moreover, the probes allowed ex vivo imaging of distinct cell regions expressing target enzyme activity in Drosophila wing disk and fat body. The high spatial selectivity and sensitivity exhibited by the 9CN-JCR probes was attributed to the electronic pre-resonance effect of the scaffold dye and aggregate formation of the hydrolysis products formed by probe-target cell interaction.The rhodol-based probes could aggregate upon reaction with the enzymes, improving their intracellular retention, and increased the SRS signal intensity during enzyme detection.In summary, the facile strategy demonstrated in this study can facilitate the development of highly specific activatable Raman probes for the simultaneous detection of multiple enzyme activities. \"Our aggregation-based molecular design strategy for Raman probes will offer substantial advantages for applications involving the investingation of enzyme activity associated with diseases and essential biological activities,\" concludes Prof. Kamiya.

  "text": "Recently, Professor Wu Dayu of Changzhou University, the user of China's Steady High Magnetic Field Facility (SHMFF), Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), together with his collaborators proposed a facile mechanical strategy to optimize the electronic structures of the catalytic center by mechanically induced spin transition, and realized a new method for designing efficient biomimetic catalysts.          The results were published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition.In recent years, the synthesis of transition-metal catalysts has received extensive attention. However, to improve catalytic activity/selectivity, it's urgent to precisely control the electronic structure of the catalytic center at the atomic level.Wu's team in-situ induced partial spin crossover (SCO) of the iron catalytic active center around the grid-like lattice from high spin (HS, S = 5/2) to low spin (LS, S = 1/2). Due to the partial SCO of the iron center, the mixed-spin (MS) nanosheet catalyst exhibited a high CO yield of 19.7 mmol g-1 and a selectivity of 91.6%, far above the high-spin counterpart.SHMFF experimental conditions were employed in this study to confirm the spin transition of the catalytic active center.Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the electron configuration of low-spin 3d orbitals effectively increased the overlap of bonding orbitals between O-2p and Fe-3dxy/dyz, thereby significantly promoting the selective adsorption of CO2. However, the high-spin 3d orbital overlapped with the O-2p orbital through the 3dz2 anti-bond orbital, which greatly weakened the bonding interaction between the catalyst and the substrate, and reduced the catalytic activity.In addition, DFT calculations showed that low-spin state played a key role in reducing the activation barrier. Researchers used electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer, Mossbauer, magnetic susceptibility and other experimental methods to analyze and characterize the electronic structure of catalysts before and after mechanical exfoliation.

  "text": "A team of researchers led by Prof. Jiang Changlong from Institute of Solid State Physics (ISSP), Hefei Institutes of Physical Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a new sensing system for detecting carbaryl residues. The research findings have been published in ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.          Carbaryl is a widely used insecticide that can easily enter the body through respiratory intake and dermal contact, resulting in serious health hazards, including carcinogenicity and reproductive abnormalities. Therefore, it is crucial to detect carbaryl residues in environmental and food samples. However, existing detection techniques such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis are time-consuming and require complex preprocessing, making them impractical for field testing.To address this issue, HFIPS researchers developed a dual-mode ratiometric fluorescent probe based on a combination of silicon quantum dots (Si QDs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe QDs). This sensing center was capable of visual quantitative detection of carbaryl with high sensitivity and immediate feedback. Upon the addition of carbaryl, the dispersion of AuNPs changed, resulting in a color change of the solution that could be observed by the naked eye.                Schematic diagram of a smartphone sensing platform detecting carbaryl. Credit: Zhang Zhong             Additionally, the fluorescence emission intensity of Si QDs increased while that of CdTe QDs decreased due to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect. The sensing system showed a dual response signal that performed a significant fluorescence color transition from red to blue under UV light. The detection limit (LOD) was as low as 16.3 nM, which was far below the maximum residue standard.The researchers then designed a portable intelligent sensing platform using 3D printing technology and color recognition, which could successfully apply the sensing system to detect carbaryl in actual samples with good selectivity and anti-interference ability.This study not only provided an advanced sensing strategy for sensitivity and rapid carbaryl detection in the field but also offered new insights into quantitative analysis of other trace analytes.Overall, the new sensing system has the potential to contribute significantly to environmental contaminant monitoring and agrifood safety.

  "text": "Stanford researchers have discovered a simple and environmentally sound way to make ammonia with tiny droplets of water and nitrogen from the air.          Ammonia (NH3) is the starting point for producing chemical fertilizers for farm crops. For over a century, the world has relied on the Haber-Bosch process to yield ammonia in bulk, a breakthrough that helped revolutionize agriculture and feed a booming human population. But the industrial procedure is energy intensive. To break nitrogen's strong bonds, the Haber-Bosch process requires roughly 80-300 atmospheres of pressure and temperatures around 572-1000 F (300-500 C). The steam-treating of natural gas involved in the process also releases ample amounts of climate-changing carbon dioxide.All told, to satisfy the current annual worldwide demand for 150 million metric tons of ammonia, the Haber-Bosch process gobbles up more than 2% of global energy and accounts for about 1% of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.In contrast, the innovative method debuted by the Stanford researchers requires less specialized circumstances.\"We were shocked to see that we could generate ammonia in benign, everyday temperature-and-pressure environments with just air and water and using something as basic as a sprayer,\" said study senior author Richard Zare, the Marguerite Blake Wilbur Professor in Natural Science and a professor of chemistry in the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences. \"If this process can be scaled up, it would represent an eco-friendly new way of making ammonia, which is one of the most important chemical processes that takes place in the world.\"The new method also uses little energy and at low cost, thus pointing a way forward to potentially producing the valuable chemical in a sustainable manner. Xiaowei Song, a postdoctoral scholar in chemistry at Stanford, is the lead author of the study, published April 10 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.New chemistry from blue-sky studyThe new chemistry discovered follows in the footsteps of pioneering work by Zare's lab in recent years examining the long-overlooked and surprisingly high reactivity of water microdroplets. In a 2019 study, Zare and colleagues novelly demonstrated that caustic hydrogen peroxide spontaneously forms in microdroplets in contact with surfaces. Experiments since have borne out a mechanism of electric charge jumping between the liquid and solid materials and generating molecular fragments, known as reactive oxygen species.Taking those findings further, Song and Zare began a collaboration with study co-author Basheer Chanbasha, a professor of chemistry at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia. Chanbasha specializes in nanomaterials for energy, petrochemical and environment applications and came to Stanford as a visiting scholar last summer.The research team zeroed in on a catalyst\u2014the term for any substance that boosts the rate of a chemical reaction but is not itself degraded or changed by the reaction\u2014that they suspected could help blaze a chemical pathway toward ammonia. The catalyst consists of an iron oxide, called magnetite, and a synthetic membrane invented in the 1960s that is composed of repeating chains of two large molecules.The researchers applied the catalyst to a Graphite mesh that Song incorporated into a gas-powered sprayer. The sprayer blasted out microdroplets in which pumped water (H2O) and compressed molecular nitrogen (N2) reacted together in the presence of the catalyst. Using a device called a mass spectrometer, Song analyzed the microdroplets' characteristics and saw the signature of ammonia in the collected data.      Low-tech, low-energy ammonia synthesisZare and colleagues were very pleased with this result, especially in light of the relatively low-tech approach. \"Our method does not require the application of any electrical voltage or form of radiation,\" said Zare.From a broader chemistry perspective, the method is remarkable in that it uses three phases of matter: nitrogen as gas, water as liquid, and catalyst as solid. \"To our knowledge, the idea of using gas, liquid, and solid all at the same time to cause a chemical transformation is a first of its kind and has a huge potential for advancing other chemical transformations,\" said Zare.While promising, the ammonia production method revealed by Zare, Song, and Chanbasha for now is only at the demonstration stage. The researchers plan to explore how to concentrate the produced ammonia as well as gauge how the process could potentially be scaled up to commercially viable levels. While Haber-Bosch is only efficient when pursued at huge facilities, the new ammonia-making method could be portable and done on-site or even on-demand at farms. That, in turn, would slash the greenhouse gas emissions related to the transportation of ammonia from far-off factories.\"With further development, we're hoping our ammonia generation method could help address the two major looming problems of continuing to feed Earth's growing population of billions of people, while still mitigating climate change,\" said Zare. \"We are hopeful and excited to continue this line of research.\"Zare is also a member of Stanford Bio-X, the Cardiovascular Institute, the Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford ChEM-H, the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, and the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute.

  "text": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are typical organic compounds found in cigarette smoke and vehicle exhaust. In addition, PAHs are produced from incomplete combustion of organic material and cooking. The highest concentrations of PM-bound PAHs ranged from 550 ng/m3 to 39,000 ng/m3, and have been observed in Chinese kitchens, fire stations, and ships.          Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may combine with ultrafine particles (UFPs) in the air to form particle-bound PAHs. PM0.1 may adsorb large amounts of toxic organic compounds, and long-term exposure to indoor UFPs from cooking has resulted in nervous responses by the human brain. PAHs have been detected in the venous blood of people exposed to combustion by-products in rural areas of China at concentrations up to 762 ng/mL.The A\u03b2 peptide contains various isoforms, with 42 amino acids in its structure. It is more abundant in human cerebrospinal fluid. It has been shown that chronic exposure of fish to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) resulted in increased concentrations of the A\u03b242 peptide in the brain, leading to a decrease in their cognitive behavior, memory locomotor and motor activity. A\u03b2 oligomers may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by damaging neurons and disrupting electrochemical signals.Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including phenanthrene, pyrene and B[a]P have increased the aggregation kinetics of the A\u03b2-peptide. Although the aggregation of A\u03b2 peptides and the formation of oligomers are enhanced in the presence of PAHs, what are the molecular interactions between A\u03b2 polypeptides and PAHs?To answer this question, researchers from Nazarbayev University, Tokyo University of Science and their teams collaborated to explore and reveal the effect of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as the major compounds of cooking particles on the structure of A\u03b242 peptide. Their study reveals that A\u03b2 polypeptides interact strongly with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of different properties, and that these organic pollutants alter the structure of A\u03b242 and promote the progression of Alzheimer's disease. This study, titled \"Effect of ambient polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nicotine on the structure of A\u03b242 protein,\" is published online in Frontiers of Environmental Science & Engineering.In this study, the research team found that the structure of the A\u03b242 peptide monomer was affected by benzo[a]pyrene, nicotine and phenanthrene molecules, depending on their hydrophobicity, size, and H-bonding capacity. The secondary structure of the A\u03b242 peptide was changed by organic pollutants, with an almost 50% decrease in the \u03b1-helix and 2%\u201310% increase in the \u03b2-sheets of the peptide. The team's results also suggested that benzo[a]pyrene, nicotine, and phenanthrene might have an effect on the progression of Alzheimer's disease.This study successfully conducted atomic and molecular dynamics studies using GROMACS to study the structure of the A\u03b242 peptide monomer in the presence of benzo[a]pyrene, nicotine and phenanthrene. This work not only analyzed the effects of organic pollutants on the results of the A\u03b2 peptide monomer at the molecular level, but also provides guidance for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and increases attention to the neurodegenerative disorders caused by air pollution.

  "text": "The Haber-Bosch process is the industrial approach for NH3 production today, which must be operated at energy-intensive high temperatures and pressures. The reduction of dinitrogen (N2) by electrocatalysis offers an alternative way for NH3 production at ambient conditions and a variety of electrocatalysts have been studied over the past few years.          However, even the best catalytic system reported could only get unsatisfied performance (such as the selectivity and production rate of NH3) due to the inertness of N2. The lithium-mediated N2 reduction reaction (Li-eN2RR) has been found to be a promising route to promote electrochemical NH3 synthesis.In this regard, a group of researchers has summarized the reaction mechanisms, the catalysts developed, and the electrolytes involved based on the most recent research progress of Li-eN2RR. They also point out the challenges and possible resolving strategies in the Li-eN2RR.This could provide a panoramic view of the related field and facilitate the development of Li-eN2RR for green NH3 production. Sun et al. published their review in Industrial Chemistry & Materials.\"The electrocatalytic reduction of N2 for the production of NH3 has been the subject of extensive research, which has been comprehensively reviewed by numerous scholars with expertise in the field,\" said corresponding author Zhenyu Sun, a professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology.\"These reviews provide detailed insights into the catalytic performance and mechanisms involved, which can be of great assistance to researchers. However, the NH3 production rate is still low, far behind the requirement of industrial application. The lithium-mediated N2 reduction reaction (Li-eN2RR) holds great potential for the production of NH3 under ambient conditions.\"\"Therefore, we provide this comprehensive overview to summarize the recent progress of Li-eN2RR. This review demonstrates the basic aspects of Li-eN2RR including the common composition of electrolytes, suppression of hydrogen evolution, reaction mechanism, the reported electrocatalysts, and the challenges and prospects, which can be helpful to new individuals in this field as well as serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals alike.\"      The rate-determining step in the synthesis of NH3 is often the adsorption and activation of N2. However, due to the inertness of N2, it is extremely hard to break the N\u2261N triple bond. In the Li-eN2RR process, Li can be used as a mediator to fix N2 as Li3N, which subsequently converts to NH3.\"There have been different viewpoints on the reaction mechanism of Li-eN2RR. We provide detailed analysis of the reported mechanisms,\" Sun said.Three different mechanisms, including chemical N2 splitting and chemical protonation, N2 activation and protonation through an associative mechanism, and chemical N2 splitting and electrochemical protonation were introduced with their respective reaction steps.The section about the reaction mechanisms of Li-eN2RR demonstrates the different routes of N2 activation and hydrogenation to NH3 production. \"Through the different mechanisms, we can have a comprehensive understanding of Li-eN2RR, which can guide the catalytic system design.\"The rational design of electrocatalysts is crucial for Li-eN2RR. There have been some strategies for the engineering of the electrodes to get enhanced performance.\"The electrocatalysts together with their design strategies were categorized based on the metal species involved,\" Sun said.\"Different kinds of electrocatalysts including noble metal catalysts such as Ru, Ag, Au; nonprecious metal catalysts such as copper-based materials, molybdenum, lithium-liquid alloy-salt, stainless steel cloth; and non-metal catalysts such as carbon-based materials were comprehensively overviewed. It was discussed in detail about their performance and the catalytic active sites in Li-eN2RR, which may enlighten the design of the future catalysts towards efficient NH3 production.\"Another important part of Li-eN2RR is the electrolytes. According to Zhenyu Sun, more attention should be given to the study of electrolytes in electrocatalytic N2 reduction considering the significance of electrolytes for the reaction and for N2 dissolution.Some Li-containing electrolytes have been developed for Li-eN2RR, yet more efforts still need to be devoted to further improving the NH3 yield. This requires the synergistic work between the electrolytes and the electrocatalysts as well as the study of their interface.\"The primary objective of this review is to provide readers with a clear understanding of the current research progress of Li-eN2RR, which is still in its early stage yet promising for electrocatalytic NH3 production. We also highlight the challenges and propose strategies to overcome them. We hope it is helpful to promote the development of Li-eN2RR towards green NH3 production,\" Sun said.

  "text": "Autologous and allogeneic bone grafts are considered the gold standard when it comes to reconstructing bones, largely due to their bioactive compounds and osteoblastic cells that can generate new bone effectively. However, limited supply, donor-site complications, and risk of disease transmission have deterred its widespread use.          In contrast, xenograft materials represent a feasible alternative because they are safe to use and come in abundance; even though they stem from mammalian tissue which is costly, poses environmental risks and ethical issues especially in underprivileged regions. Nonetheless, xenograft materials do have their limitations. Most commercialized xenograft materials are prepared from mammalian tissue with heavy bio-cost, environmental pollution and potential ethical issues, especially in underdeveloped areas.Therefore, a top priority of bone graft materials development is to obtain safe, modifiable, and environmentally friendly synthetic biomaterials capable of replacing natural graft materials\u2014the exact motivation that spurred a new discovery by an international team of researchers.Recently, a research team developed a dissolution-precipitation method to convert eggshells into endotoxin-free and immunocompatible amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) particles.\"Eggshells is an ideal raw material to synthesize bone graft materials as it contains plenty of calcium and phosphorous components,\" said first author of the study, Dr. Qianli Ma Qianli Ma the Department of Biomaterials at the University of Oslo (UiO). \"In addition, some trace elements associated with bone regeneration, such as magnesium and strontium, are also found in eggshell.\"                Osteogenic eggshell acp materials in 3d spheroids: eggshell acp encourages osteoblasts to produce a large amount of opn and collagen i for supporting bone formation.

In the model, ACP materials were observed to interact with osteoblasts more realistically, and were safe, cell-friendly and effective in promoting bone regeneration.\"This technique promises to create an unlimited supply of bioactive and sustainable bone graft materials while reducing the environmental pollution,\" said senior and corresponding author Professor H\u00e5vard Jostein Haugen, who is from the same department at UiO. \"The osteoblastic spheroids constructed in the study provided a more practical biomaterial research model, reflecting the three-dimensional interactions between cells and biomaterials.\"The researchers hope their latest findings, published in Smart Materials in Medicine, will inspire further work on converting ordinary food waste into high value-added biomaterials.

  "text": "Excessive use of fossil energy causes global warming and other environmental problems. To reduce the greenhouse effect, two major greenhouse gases-CO2 and CH4 as the feedback are used to produce syngas (CO and H2) by CO2-CH4 reforming technique (DRM).       The key to DRM is the choice of catalyst. The catalyst for DRM reaction mainly consists of two parts: the active metal and the support, in which a suitable support plays an important role in promoting the reaction activity and stability. Currently, ZrO2 is considered as a promising catalyst support due to the presence of oxygen vacancies. However, studies on the effect of oxygen vacancies on the ZrO2 surface for CO2 adsorption and activation processes are still lacking.A research group of Juntian Niu from Taiyuan University of Technology investigated the effect of oxygen vacancies for the adsorption and activation of CO2 on the surface ZrO2 by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.They found that the oxygen vacancies contribute greatly to both the adsorption and activation of CO2, and the essence lies in oxygen vacancies greatly facilitate the charge transfer from the ZrO2 surface to the CO2 molecule. Additionally, it was found that t-ZrO2 with the presence of oxygen vacancies is most favorable to the adsorption and activation of CO2 by the comparison of different ZrO2 crystalline phases.The new findings elucidated the role of oxygen vacancies in CO2 adsorption and activation for the preparation of high-performance DRM reaction catalysts using ZrO2. Meanwhile, it provided guidance for the design of CO2 high-efficient catalysts at an atomic level.These findings were published in Frontiers in Energy.

This added to the already significant amount of PPE waste generated by hospitals and in other medical settings.          Researchers from Heriot-Watt University have developed a process that degrades a common face mask using the power of fresh air and 200W of electricity\u2014about the same as a small microwave.The team's findings are reported in the journal npj Materials Degradation.Dr. Humphrey Yiu, assistant professor at Heriot-Watt University, said, \"PPE from the health care sector has always been a waste challenge.

  "answer_squad": " Enhanced utilization of bark by means of cascade processing",
  "text": "The extractives and chemical composition of hybrid aspen bark allow it to be used in several applications in the chemical industry. In the doctoral dissertation of Pasi Korkalo, who is a researcher at the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) and a doctoral student at the University of Oulu's Sustainable Chemistry unit, the chemical composition of the bark biomass of hybrid aspen was studied, activated carbon was produced from the bark extract, and a pesticide chemical was produced from the bark's hemicellulose. All chemical products were separated from the biomass following cascade processing principles.          The hybrid aspen tree, a species that originated from the crossbreeding of European and American aspen, was introduced to Finland in the 1950s. Its fast growth made it an attractive raw material for the wood industry. However, the hybrid aspen did not reach the same value as other dominant tree species in the market, as the market changed significantly before the cultivated hybrid aspen plantations were ready for harvesting.\"Currently, hybrid aspen is seen as an opportunity to increase diversity in conifer-dominated forests. Applied chemistry can explore new uses and added value of the trees,\" says Pasi Korkalo.Enhanced utilization of bark by means of cascade processingThe extractives and chemical structure of hybrid aspen bark make it suitable for various applications in the chemical industry. The goal of the doctoral research was to produce different fractions from the same bark biomass for further processing, by using the cascade processing principle.First, rigid carbon foam was produced from hybrid aspen bark extracts, which can replace fossil-based foam chemicals in insulation or filler applications that require heat tolerance. Rigid foam also works well as a starting material for activated carbon.After separating the extractives from the bark, the extraction residue was further utilized by torrefication, i.e., roasting in oxygen-free conditions. The method produced a distillate that was found to be an effective chemical in controlling certain weeds and fungal diseases of plant crops. The study found that hot water extraction of bark , that was applied to separate raw material for the foams, improved the performance of the chemical produced from the extraction residue against weeds.Finally, after the production of chemicals, torrefied bark biomass still remained, which could be further utilized as a raw material for biochar or in energy production.Korkalo concludes, \"By using cascade processing of the bark, several possibilities for use and added value can be achieved from a single raw material source. This, in turn, can arouse new interest in the possibilities of using hybrid aspen and the biomass separated from the species.\"In cascade processing, different value components and bioproducts are separated from the raw material, i.e., the main or side stream of biomass, by sequentially connected technological unit processes. The entire biomass is fully utilized into products, nutrients, and energy of the highest possible added value, while avoiding the creation of new unused by-products.

  "question_squad": " What is the most common way to generate hydrogen?",
  "answer_squad": " water electrolysis",
  "text": "University of Alberta researchers have developed a new catalyst that could revolutionize how we generate power and purify water. When placed in any type of water and provided with a small amount of power, the catalyst produces hydrogen that can be fed into a fuel cell to generate electricity along with distilled water that is safe to drink.          The catalyst was discovered almost entirely by chance when Robin Hamilton was creating an electrode for an undergraduate student working on a waste biomass upcycling project. He mixed up a combination of powders and allowed them to sit overnight in water, intending to finish the cell the following day. When he returned in the morning, the mixture was bubbling\u2014a reaction that was extremely out of the ordinary.\"It ends up being that when you mix these two things together, they interact, they work together and hydrogen comes off. It floored us,\" says Hamilton, a senior research associate in the Department of Chemistry.Hamilton consulted chemistry professors Jeff Stryker and Jonathan Veinot, sharing the unexpected discovery and drawing on their respective expertise. The team quickly realized they had something remarkable on their hands\u2014the specific combination of powders could serve as a new type of catalyst.The catalyst they created is made with material that is non-toxic and plentiful. It's easy and inexpensive to produce, making it an affordable and accessible alternative to current catalysts on the market, which require materials that are expensive and in limited supply.Their catalyst can also be used with any type of water, another factor that gives it an edge over current ways to generate hydrogen, such as water electrolysis.\"There's a scarcity of potable water and that's the biggest problem with water electrolysis to generate hydrogen\u2014you have to use clean water,\" says Hamilton. \"With this, you don't. We take something that is dirty, that you can't drink, and generate hydrogen and electricity in a fuel cell. And it spits out water you can drink.\"\"You could turn oil sands tailings ponds into usable fuel while purifying the water. It sounds incredulous, it sounds like it's too good to be true, but it's not,\" adds Veinot.In addition to the catalyst being a marked improvement on the current catalysts available, it also transforms what is typically an energy-intensive process into something that can be achieved with far lower temperatures and less energy input.      The new catalyst-driven process also results in little oxygen, making it less volatile than current methods. As Hamilton explains, when using a hydrogen fuel cell, the most common method to generate hydrogen is through water electrolysis. This process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen, separates them, then recombines them in the fuel cell to generate electricity.\"You mix hydrogen and oxygen and reach certain concentrations, that's an explosive mixture. So you have to separate them to be able to use it safely. With our method, we sequester the oxygen without these expensive membrane separators that are normally used, and we can generate the hydrogen and have it go directly into the fuel cell. You don't have to separate it,\" says Hamilton.\"Think about having your garden hose providing you with the water that can be converted basically on demand to the fuel you want. It takes away transport, it takes away storage, it takes away negative explosive possibilities,\" adds Veinot.The researchers are initially looking to craft off-grid devices that could help remote communities or aid in disaster relief, when access to natural gas and potable water is an issue. They're envisioning an all-in-one system that is relatively compact and easy to use\u2014\"kind of like a SodaStream, but instead of squirting out CO2 to get your fizzy drink, it's off-gassing hydrogen that goes into your fuel cell to generate your power,\" says Hamilton.\"Off-grid solutions are the initial target because that's where we can make the most impact.\"Applied Quantum Materials, a company co-founded by Veinot, is incubating Dark Matter Materials, a new company co-founded by Stryker and Hamilton to commercialize the new catalyst and method. Dark Matter Materials has already received interest from the local energy and agricultural sector, as well as from several multinational companies based in the United States, Europe, and Asia.\"We're in a unique circumstance in Alberta in that Edmonton is going to be a hydrogen hub. The U of A has a history in energy involvement, and the chemistry department has a history of involvement with energy with respect to the oilsands,\" says Veinot. \"We now have a pivotal opportunity to push this forward to the next level.\" Provided byUniversity of AlbertaCitation:Researchers discover a way to produce hydrogen and purify water at the same time (2023, April 24)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-hydrogen-purify.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Cellular respiration is a complex and highly regulated process that allows cells to draw energy from nutrition. An international team of scientists in Finland, Germany and Poland have investigated the important role of long-chain fatty acids in guiding this process. The findings, published in Nature Communications, will shed light on the understanding of mitochondrial function that involve disruptions in cellular energy metabolism.          They are tiny and highly efficient energy factories operating inside our cells. Often referred to as \"powerhouses,\" mitochondria extract most cellular energy from nutrition. Researchers from the University of Oulu, (Finland), the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS, Germany), and the University of Warsaw (Poland) have now succeeded in demonstrating how long-chain fatty acids regulate the amount of energy drawn in this process called cellular respiration. The discovery is ground-breaking as the importance of long-chain fatty acids produced by mitochondria in cellular respiration had not been previously known and the results open up a completely novel approach.\"This information helps us understand diseases that involve impaired mitochondrial function and cellular respiration much better than before,\" says M. Tanvir Rahman from the University of Oulu and lead author on the paper.The study is part of a more extensive research project investigating the connection between cellular respiration and the cell's nutritional state. The scientists used a protein engineering method, in which the mutants of the so-called MECR enzyme involved in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis were designed using computational molecular modeling, along with structure determination by crystallography, and other experiments to validate the predictions. \"Our study is an example of a successful case of targeted protein modification,\" says researcher Kaija Autio from the University of Oulu.The experiments in this interdisciplinary study were carried out by biochemists and crystallographers from the Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine of the University of Oulu and Biocenter Oulu, while the molecular modeling was done by computational biophysicists from the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS) and the University of Warsaw. \"This study really demonstrates the value of combining computational and experimental approaches to reveal complex biomolecular mechanisms,\" says Rebecca Wade from HITS.

  "text": "Electrocatalysis as an efficient energy storage and conversion technology opens up a new path to solve the existing problems of energy depletion and environmental pollution caused by fossil fuel consumption. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of crystalline porous materials with high specific surface area, high porosity, and designable structure, have shown great potential as new electrocatalysts. However, the inherent low electrical conductivity and low stability of MOFs have greatly hindered their further application in electrocatalysis.          How to design and synthesize highly stable and conductive MOFs materials, and regulate the energy of MOFs electrocatalytic reaction intermediates and the adsorption strength of active species are the keys to enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. Based on the above ideas, a large number of MOFs-based electrocatalysts have been newly reported in recent years. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a timely summary of the latest progress. Li et al. published their review in Industrial Chemistry & Materials.\"The development of efficient, green, and low-cost metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-based electrocatalysts is crucial to address the existing energy depletion and environmental pollution problems caused by fossil fuel consumption,\" said Jiandong Pang, a professor at Nankai University.\"In this review, we systematically summarized the research progress on the application of MOFs materials in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), hydrogen oxidation reactions (HOR), oxygen evolution reactions (OER), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), and nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) according to the categories of monometallic MOFs, bimetallic MOFs, MOF-based composites and MOFs as supports, thus revealing the structure-property relationships.\"\"Strategies to enhance the stability and conductivity of MOFs-based electrocatalytic materials are also summarized. We also provided an outlook on the opportunities and challenges facing MOFs in electrocatalysis and list the problems that need to be explored and solved.\"As a new type of crystalline porous material, MOFs are known for their various predictable and designable structures, high surface area, guest-accessible voids, and easily functionalized channels. MOFs materials are currently used in a wide range of different electrocatalytic reactions, including HER, HOR, ORR, and OER.These reactions are at the heart of the following devices or cells: metal air cells, renewable fuel cells, electrolytic water to hydrogen devices, and other important electrochemical energy conversion devices. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen to ammonia also shows attractive applications in the field of energy conversion.      Despite the many unique advantages of the above electrocatalytic reactions, their cost must be carefully considered in order to achieve commercialization. Therefore, it is essential and urgent to design green, low energy consuming, and highly stable MOFs electrocatalysts from both efficiency and cost perspectives.\"The synthesis of MOFs with predictable structures and high stability has been an important goal in the field of MOF research. A clear strategy to guide the design of ligands and metals will help to develop novel functionalized MOFs and provide a fire-new reference for various fields,\" Pang said.\"Synthesis with the same reactants may lead to MOFs with different topologies and properties, and the reaction time, method, and temperature of synthesis will also affect the crystal structure, morphology, and pore environment of MOFs, which will further affect the performance of the materials. There are two common adjustment directions for the synthesis of MOF-based electrocatalysts, i.e., tuning the size of MOFs and modulating the conductivity of MOFs.\"\"Furthermore, based on the diversity of metal ions and ligands, specific metal centers and ligands containing specific organic functional groups can be selected to design and synthesize MOFs with high stability under catalytic environment and applied to the study of electrocatalysis. To make MOFs with high stability, researchers generally choose to construct frameworks using carboxylate-based ligands (hard Lewis bases) and high-valent metal ions (hard Lewis acids, such as Al3+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Ti4+, and Zr4+) or azo-based ligands (soft Lewis bases) and low-valent transition metal ions (soft Lewis acids, such as Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) based on hard-soft-acid-base (HSAB) theory. The designed MOF possesses high stability and will greatly enhance its electrocatalytic performance,\" said Xian-He Bu, a professor at Nankai University.Pang said that there is still great scope for optimizing MOFs materials for future electrocatalytic designs. Incorporating catalytically active ligands (e.g. porphyrins) into MOFs and modulating the catalytic effect by adjusting the pore environment and pore structure is an effective strategy to enhance electrocatalytic performance. In addition, the formation of MOFs with bimetallic active sites using binuclear metal clusters/ions to optimize the electronic structure and surface state of the metal centers is also a feasible strategy.To maximize the benefits of MOFs, the use of MOFs as supports for loading metal nanoparticles or metal monoatoms and the compounding of MOFs with inorganic active materials are also suggested strategies.\"In this review, our main goal is to provide readers with timely and accurate updates on the latest research advances and electrocatalytic performance enhancement strategies in the field, while providing an outlook for future developments in the field,\" Bu said.

Their research results were published in Journal of Materials Chemistry C.The misuse of biochemical molecules can cause significant environmental problems, so developing low-cost sensors for detecting these molecules is essential.The sensor they've developed is called the high-throughput near-infrared surface-enhanced Raman scattering (HNIR-SERS) biochemical sensor. It's a combination of inkjet printing technology and plasma metal nanoparticles that enables high-sensitivity detection of multiple biochemical molecules in one substrate.To develop this sensor, researchers utilized imprinting technology to fabricate a grid substrate with separated regions arranged in a typical cubic pattern.They then assembled porous Au@AuAg nanorods on the substrate using inkjet printing, resulting in the formation of the HNIR-SERS sensor. This new type of sensor achieves high sensitivity and specificity in detecting multiple biochemical molecules on one substrate.The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of the HNIR-SERS sensor by detecting 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP), rhodamine 6G (R6G), methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) with an enhancement factor of 108 for 4-ATP.This development provides an effective method for realizing high-throughput and low-cost NIR-SERS sensors and could pave the way for practical applications in Raman detection chips.

  "answer_squad": " RNA ligases",
  "text": "Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are single-stranded molecules that play an essential role in the cells of all living organisms. As \"transcripts\" of our genes, mRNAs, for example, are involved in the translation of genetic information by carrying in their own sequence the instructions for the creation of a protein. \"In order to fulfill their diverse functions in the cell, RNAs often need to be chemically modified after their creation or repaired after damage,\" explains Andreas Marx, professor of organic and cellular chemistry at the University of Konstanz.          One chemical reaction that plays a role here is the three-step linking (ligation) of two RNA strands at their respective opposite ends. This reaction is triggered by specialized enzymes called RNA ligases and is present in all forms of life, from viruses to fungi and plants. In vertebrates, including humans, such RNA ligases had yet to be identified.An interdisciplinary research team from Konstanz has now discovered the first human RNA ligase of this type, the protein C12orf29. At the cellular level, the study results, published in Nature Communications, suggest a protective function of the enzyme against cellular stress.Antioxidant defense system of our cells\"We noticed C12orf29 during extensive studies of human lung carcinoma and kidney cells that we performed in search of proteins with a specific chemical signature and for which we used new chemical tools. It caught our attention because until then it was not understood what the protein's functions were,\" Marx says.The researchers therefore developed and used various protocols to purify and predict the structure of the unexplored protein and performed experiments to track down its chemical function. They were thus able to prove what was initially only a reasonable suspicion: C12orf29 links RNA strands using adenosine triphosphate (ATP).The researchers were able to show in detail that this process follows a characteristic, three-step reaction pattern known from other RNA ligases of other life forms. To learn more about the function of C12orf29 at the cellular level, the researchers went one step further after elucidating the chemical mechanism.\"We used the CRISPR/Cas gene scissors to generate a line of human kidney cells in which the gene encoding C12orf29 was knocked out. We were then able to compare these knockout (KO) cells with 'normal' kidney cells under varying experimental conditions,\" Marx explains.In particular, when treating the cells with menadione, a K vitamin, clear differences were observed between KO cells and the wild-type cells with functional RNA ligase: Comparatively low concentrations of menadione were sufficient to damage KO cells. In contrast, the wild-type cells were only damaged at significantly higher concentrations.Since menadione is known to cause oxidative stress, the researchers concluded from this result that C12orf29 protects against oxidative cellular stress. \"We assume that a previously hidden human RNA repair mechanism underlies this biological function of C12orf29. We now need to examine this mechanism in further studies,\" Marx says. More information:Yizhi Yuan et al, Chemoproteomic discovery of a human RNA ligase, Nature Communications (2023).

Ce element with unique electronic structure can be used to modify semiconductor photocatalysts to improve their photocatalytic performance.In a study published in Molecules, the research group led by Prof. Lu Canzhong from Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, reported the visible light absorption of Ce/TiO2.The researchers achieved simultaneous doping of Ce in the TiO2 lattice using a simple sol-gel method which achieved Ce synchronous doping in the lattice of TiO2. They observed morphology and structure of the pure TiO2, Ce-doped TiO2 (Ce/TiO2), and CeO2-mixed TiO2 (CeO2-TiO2) samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). They found that Ce doping in the lattice of anatase TiO2 resulted in a smaller grain size of the sample.Additionally, the researchers revealed the high photocurrent density (10.9 \u03bcA\u00d7cm-2) of Ce/TiO2 by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test, which is 2.5 times that of common TiO2 material (4.3 \u03bcA\u00d7cm-2).

Ce/TiO2 shows visible light absorption up to 500 nm, while pure TiO2 shows no obvious response in the visible region.Moreover, the researchers unveiled that the electron-trapping centers formed by Ce doping into the TiO2 lattice improved the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes. The narrow bandgap of Ce-doped TiO2 showed excellent visible light absorption and photocurrent response. Due to the Ce doping, the Ce/TiO2 samples achieved high photocurrent density and incident photon current efficiency (IPCE).This study provides a practical strategy and an important reference for the preparation and understanding of highly efficient visible light-activated rare earth-doped photocatalysts.

  "text": "A new smart material developed by researchers at the University of Waterloo is activated by both heat and electricity, making it the first ever to respond to two different stimuli.          The unique design paves the way for a wide variety of potential applications, including clothing that warms up while you walk from the car to the office in winter and vehicle bumpers that return to their original shape after a collision.Inexpensively made with polymer nano-composite fibres from recycled plastic, the programmable fabric can change its color and shape when stimuli are applied.\"As a wearable material alone, it has almost infinite potential in AI, robotics and virtual reality games and experiences,\" said Dr. Milad Kamkar, a chemical engineering professor at Waterloo. \"Imagine feeling warmth or a physical trigger eliciting a more in-depth adventure in the virtual world.\"The novel fabric design is a product of the happy union of soft and hard materials, featuring a combination of highly engineered polymer composites and stainless steel in a woven structure.Researchers created a device similar to a traditional loom to weave the smart fabric. The resulting process is extremely versatile, enabling design freedom and macro-scale control of the fabric's properties.The fabric can also be activated by a lower voltage of electricity than previous systems, making it more energy-efficient and cost-effective. In addition, lower voltage allows integration into smaller, more portable devices, making it suitable for use in biomedical devices and environment sensors.\"The idea of these intelligent materials was first bred and born from biomimicry science,\" said Kamkar, director of the Multi-scale Materials Design (MMD) Centre at Waterloo.\"Through the ability to sense and react to environmental stimuli such as temperature, this is proof of concept that our new material can interact with the environment to monitor ecosystems without damaging them.\"The next step for researchers is to improve the fabric's shape-memory performance for applications in the field of robotics. The aim is to construct a robot that can effectively carry and transfer weight to complete tasks.The findings are published in the journal Small.

Textiles with antimicrobial properties could reduce the use of antibiotics. On February 28, Tuser Biswas defended his doctoral thesis Enzyme Printed Fabrics: Bio-functionalisation of Synthetic Textiles by Digital Inkjet PrintingThe conventional textile industry devours natural resources in the form of water, energy, and chemicals. A more resource-efficient way to produce textiles is with ink jet printing. Tuser Biswas, who recently defended his doctoral thesis in Textile Material Technology, seeks to develop methods for functional textiles. He has shown that it is possible to print enzymes on textiles. These are proteins that function as catalysts in the body, as they set chemical processes in motion without themselves changing. They could, for example, be used in medical textiles with antimicrobial properties or to measure biological or chemical reactions.\"Ever since the industrial revolution, our society has used an abundance of synthetic and harsh chemicals. Our research works to replace these chemicals with environmentally friendly and bio-based materials,\" said Tuser Biswas.Promising results with enzymes on textilesDeveloping a good enzyme ink was not entirely easy and it took a number of attempts before he finally, to his great joy, had successful results. Tuser Biswas explained that the most important result is to show how a printed enzyme could bind another enzyme to the surface of a fabric. Although the activity of the enzymes decreased by 20%\u201330% after printing, the results are still promising for future applications. At the same time, the work has provided new knowledge about many fundamental questions about printing biomaterials on fabric.\"Before starting the project, we found several related studies that focused on producing a finished product. But we wanted to study the fundamental challenges of this subject, and now we know how to make it work,\" said Tuser Biswas.He is now seeking funding to continue researching the subject and has so far received a grant from the Sjuh\u00e4rad Savings Bank Foundation. During the Days of Knowledge event on April 20, he will talk about his research to representatives from the City of Bor\u00e5s and business, the Sjuh\u00e4rad Savings Bank Foundation, and the University of Bor\u00e5s.Medical textiles instead of antibioticsTuser Biswas hopes that continued research in textile technology can provide alternatives to using antibiotics. With increasing antibiotic resistance, it is an important issue not only locally but worldwide.\"Instead of treating the patient with a course of antibiotics, one can act preventively and more effectively by damaging the bacteria on the surface where they start to grow. In a wound dressing, for example. Nanoparticle-based antimicrobials can reduce growth effectively. It is possible as nanoparticles can interact better with the bacterial membrane and reach the target more easily than conventional antimicrobials.\" Provided byUniversity of Bor\u00e5sCitation:Functional textiles: An alternative to antibiotics (2023, April 21)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-functional-textiles-alternative-antibiotics.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " eosin Y",
  "text": "National University of Singapore (NUS) scientists have demonstrated that stepwise customized functionalization of multihydrosilanes to access fully substituted silicon compounds can be realized using neutral eosin Y, an inexpensive dye molecule.          The development of a unified catalytic platform for stepwise and programmable functionalization of multihydrosilanes is highly challenging. However, having this platform will facilitate the rational design of organosilanes with predictable functions, in which bespoke silane molecules are required.Three specific requirements need to be simultaneously realized through a single catalytic system: (i) the selective and preferable hydrogen atom abstraction of silicon-hydrogen (Si-H) bonds in the presence of various activated carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds; (ii) a diverse range of Si-H functionalisations; and (iii) highly selective monofunctionalization of di- and trihydrosilanes.In a recent paper, Associate Professor Jie WU and his colleagues from the Department of Chemistry, NUS, have developed a new method for synthesizing organosilanes, a family of chemical compounds which have a variety of applications from organic and polymer synthesis, materials science, medicinal chemistry, to agriculture.The researchers used eosin Y, a low-cost, readily available dye molecule, as a photocatalyst to selectively remove hydrogen atoms from hydrosilanes. This enables different functional chemical groups to be attached to the silicon atom in a step by step manner, potentially creating a wide variety of useful silicon compounds. An amount of energy of approximately 90 kcal/mol is required to break a Si-H bond, and the uniqueness of this catalyst is that it uses much lower energy (~63 kcal/mol) to break the Si-H bond.Also, unlike other photocatalysts, eosin Y is able to selectively break the Si-H bonds rather than some more reactive C-H bonds. More than eight different new chemical transformations have been realized by the research team using various commodity feedstocks as the starting materials to react with hydrosilanes.These findings were published in the journal Nature Chemistry.The researchers also used a continuous microflow reactor for the monofunctionalization of di- and trihydrosilanes, which resulted in high selectivity and yield. Unlike conventional bath reactors, the continuous microflow reactor allows for high mixing efficiency and precise residence time control. Also, this process is highly scalable. The use of eosin Y with microflow reactor offers a convenient strategy for stepwise decoration of silicon atoms to access silanes with four different substituents in a programmable and on-demand manner.The research team plans to extend the strategy to generate chiral silicon reagents, and to apply this method to materials/polymers containing Si-H bonds for post-functionalization purposes. They are also working towards fully automating the on-demand synthesis of multifunctional silanes.Prof Wu said, \"We would like to establish a general and sustainable strategy to synthesize functional organosilanes in an efficient, on-demand, and fully automated fashion. With this method, the preparation of desired silicon reagents will be more easily accessible, and in future, chemists can focus their energies on the design and development of functional silicon molecules limited only by their imagination.\" More information:Xuanzi Fan et al, Stepwise on-demand functionalization of multihydrosilanes enabled by a hydrogen-atom-transfer photocatalyst based on eosin Y, Nature Chemistry (2023).

  "answer_squad": " photoactivatable fluorophores",
  "text": "Inspired by the mechanism behind light-sensitive sunglasses, a team led by a North Carolina State University researcher invented a family of fluorescent dyes to illuminate biological processes at a very small scale\u2014comparable in size to human hair.          The researchers described the mechanism behind the dyes in a publication in ACS Applied Optical Materials, led by Yang Zhang, assistant professor of textile engineering, chemistry and science at NC State.The Abstract spoke to Zhang about how the dyes work.The Abstract: How do these dyes work?Yang Zhang: We designed a family of dyes called \"photoactivatable fluorophores.\" These fluorescent dye molecules change color when they're hit by blue light irradiation. The dyes change color because part of the dye structure is photosensitive, and light irradiation changes their molecular structure. The dye conformations will emit light on a greener spectrum initially, and will emit red light after irradiation.TA: How do the dyes fluoresce?Zhang: It's like when human beings eat food, we absorb energy so we can do work, and then we go to bed to relax. After the molecule absorbs the energy, it wants to relax back to its ground state, so it relaxes and throws out the photons. The microscopic biological world is dark, and these dyes help to illuminate the biological processes with a microscope.TA: How do you use them to illuminate microscopic processes?Zhang: We designed these dyes to be used with microscopy in basic biomedical research, although they have not been used in humans. We used the dyes to illuminate tiny transport molecules, or nanocarriers, diffusing within developing nematodes, or in developing flies. Those are typically hard to image using any other approaches.Currently, we are exploring our dyes for single-molecule imaging, building upon work that won three scientists the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2014. This technique helps biomedical researchers investigate complicated life processes down to the nanoscale\u2014in other words, at the molecular level.TA: Do dyes like this exist already, and if so, how are the ones you worked on different?Zhang: The dyes we worked on are brighter, and we think they are safer. That's because they emit light in the near-infrared region. You want to avoid having irradiation absorbed into tissue or cells. Also, we excite the cells by hitting them with light at a longer wavelength, so at a lower energy level. That will avoid heating up the cells, and potentially killing them. Our next steps are to look more closely at the phototoxicity levels to see how these dyes can be used more widely for single-molecule imaging.

  "answer_race": " To introduce a new research on TB.",
  "question_squad": " What is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide?",
  "answer_squad": " TB",
  "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide that is spread in the air like the common cold. TB is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and was responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Mtb will usually attack the lungs but can attack any part of the body.          Drug resistant TB strains are spreading and present a major concern. New work and a paper by a team of scientists from Manchester, Cambridge and Huddersfield Universities using a structure-guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization obtained a series of compounds with activity against clinically relevant drug-resistant isolates. These will support further development of much-needed additional treatment options against Mtb.During infection the TB bacteria can utilize lipids (cholesterol and fatty acids) from the human host to act as nutrients to maintain and fuel the infectious state.  The teams' paper, just published in Chemistry\u2014A European Journal, outlines this collaborative project and the results of their research into a set of enzymes involved in a key step in the breakdown of host cholesterol used by the TB bacteria.Called \"Structure Based Discovery of Inhibitors of CYP125 and CYP142 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis,\" their work involves characterizing the enzymes using the UK's national synchrotron, Diamond Light Source X-ray macromolecular crystallography beamlines to view their structures in molecular detail.Corresponding author, Dr. Kirsty McLean Senior Lecturer in Cell Biology/Biochemistry in the Department of Biological and Geographical Sciences, University of Huddersfield explained that these enzyme structures are used to design inhibitor molecules that can bind to the enzymes and prevent them doing their job\u2014essential for TB infection.The inhibitors molecules initially came from screening a library of small chemical compounds and were then gradually built up and synthesized chemically designing them to sit specifically into the enzyme structure. This process iteratively combines protein structure knowledge and chemical synthesis to design a succession of better inhibitors. The leading compounds were tested against clinically active and drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and revealed anti-TB activity.\"Using a structure-guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization, compounds with micromolar range in-cell activity against clinically relevant drug-resistant isolates were obtained. These will support further development of much-needed additional treatment options and provide routes to probe the role of CYP125 and CYP142 in Mtb pathogenesis. This study should incite further development of an alternative range of anti-TB inhibitors,\" adds Dr. McLean.Dave Hall, Science Group Leader for Diamond's Macromolecular Crystallography Group concludes, \"Much of the team's X-ray diffraction data was collected and managed using tools for remote access to our beamlines and new shift modes. Our staff worked closely with the group across various of our beamlines including I03, I04, I04-1 and I24. We are delighted to have helped move this important research on to the next stage.\"With the emergence of extensive drug resistance, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed, and continued drug discovery efforts required. Host-derived lipids such as cholesterol support Mtb growth, and are also suspected to function in immunomodulation, with links to persistence and immune evasion. Mtb cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes facilitate key steps in cholesterol catabolism and thus present potential targets for inhibition.The authors present a series of compounds based on an ethyl 5-(pyridin-4-yl)-1H-indole-2-carboxylate pharmacophore, which bind strongly to both Mtb cholesterol oxidases CYP125 and CYP142.

  "answer_race": " A new kind of tissue scaffold.",
  "question_squad": " What is the basic protein that makes up the intercellular matrix?",
  "answer_squad": " Collagen",
  "text": "Collagen is the basic protein that makes up the intercellular matrix, or in other words, the environment for the connective tissue cells of our body, such as tendons, bone, and cartilage. It looks like long threads, woven into three-dimensional networks. This, in turn, creates a kind of a tissue scaffold.          Due to the fact that collagen fibers are durable, elastic, and also serve as signals that determine the cell's so-called destiny, in medicine they are used as an environment to accelerate growth and differentiation of tissues, for example in wound healing. Most often such materials are artificially synthesized from collagen dissolution. However, even the most advanced technologies are unable to create collagen \"networks\" that exactly repeat the structure of a natural cellular environment, most favorable for its regeneration, or in other words, tissue repair.Scientists from Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University (Kaliningrad) with their colleagues from Voronezh State University (Voronezh) have proposed to use natural collagen extracted from Dosidicus gigas squid as tissue scaffold for growing cells instead of artificially synthesized collagen.This large marine animal is the most popular commercial species of squid that is used in cooking and also by scientists when studying animal brain and behavior. With regard to the availability and high volumes of Dosidicus gigas catch (up to 700 tons a year), this species may yet become a source of collagen for medical purposes on an industrial scale.                Structure of the scaffold material. Credit: Evgeny Chupakhin             The authors have extracted collagen from the squid's skin, then the protein was blended with glycerin and water and dried in a special chamber, in order to shape it in the form of a scaffold. The durability and elasticity of the resulting fibrous material was then tested by stretching the sample. It turned out that the material's mechanical properties matched those already used as cell scaffolds in regenerative medicine.Analysis of amino acid sequence, which is part of the protein, has shown that the Dosidicus gigas collagen is similar to mammal collagen, making it possible to be used when working wit human cell cultures with no risk of rejection.In order to experimentally prove that the squid scaffold is suitable for growing human cells, scientists have placed samples into small plastic nutrient-filled walls, and afterwards applied human stem cell cultures onto their surfaces.      Cell culture observation has shown that in four days the cells strongly bound to the collagen scaffold, forming a big network with each other. Besides that, cells began to actively interact with the substrate, transforming it and releasing extracellular matrix into the environment\u2014molecules which play an important role in tissue restoration. The authors have also concluded that squid collagen has no toxic effect, since the median survival of cells that were cultivated there was 90%.\"The technology of creating collagen scaffolds of squid protein is quite simple, and therefore can be easily used at an industrial scale. The experiments have shown that our proposed material has high durability and elasticity, it is biocompatible, non-toxic, and also contributes to growth, division and migration of human embryonic cells. This suggests that it can be considered a promising replacement for synthetic collagen, currently used in modern regenerative medicine,\" says Evgeny Chupakhin, associate professor of PSC Institute of Medicine and Life Sciences at Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University.The results of the work have already attracted the interest of the industry. For example, only one company, Varseas, produces collagen of the described type in Russia.The study is published in the journal Polymers.

  "answer_squad": " ChatGPT",
  "text": "The artificial intelligence developer OpenAI promises to reshape the way people work and learn with its new chatbot called ChatGPT. At the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, in fact, the large language model is already aiding materials engineers, who are harnessing its power to quickly and cost-effectively extract information from scientific literature.          For several years, Dane Morgan, a professor of materials science and engineering at UW\u2013Madison, has used machine learning, a type of data-based AI, in his lab to evaluate and search for new types of materials with great success. Maciej Polak, a staff scientist who works closely with Morgan, brainstormed other tasks AI might help with.\"AI can increasingly help with tasks that are quite complex and time consuming,\" says Polak. \"And we thought, 'What is something materials scientists do very often that we wish we had more time for?' One key thing is reading papers to get data.\"Polak says materials scientists often download and then comb through long research papers to search for one small group of numbers to add to their data sets.\"We thought we could just offload all of these time-consuming tasks onto an AI that could read those papers for us and give us that information,\" says Polak.Asking chatbots, even powerful ones like ChatGPT, to simply look for and extract data from the full text of a paper remains beyond their capabilities. So Polak refined the technique, asking the bots to review sentence by sentence and decide whether each contained relevant data or not\u2014a task that boiled papers down to one or two key sentences. He then asked the bots to present the information in a table form, at which point a human researcher could review the table and sentences to make sure they were correct and relevant. The technique yielded an accuracy rate of about 90%, allowing the researchers to extract data from a set of papers to create a database on the critical cooling rates for metallic glasses.In February 2023, Polak, Morgan and colleagues posted a paper about the technique on the arXiv preprint server.While the technique reduced the researchers' paper-reading workload by about 99%, Polak was interested in improving it even more.\"I was the person still doing that last, manual step\u2014checking the accuracy of the tables,\" he says. \"So, I wanted to find a way to fully automate this process.\"      To get to that point, the team engaged in \"prompt\" engineering\u2014figuring out the exact questions and sequence that would cause the bot to extract and then double-check the information they wanted. They applied their initial approach to extracted the data table, and then they asked the bot a series of follow-up questions to introduce the possibility that the data set was wrong. That forced the AI to double back, recheck the data and flag mistakes. In the vast majority of cases, the AI was able to identify faulty information.\"That's the most important thing; it can admit it made a mistake,\" says Polak. \"Maybe it doesn't know how to fix it, but at least we're not getting factually incorrect information.\"The team released a separate paper on this iteration of the technique on arXiv in March 2023.Morgan says this type of prompt engineering with ChatGPT and other large language models feels unusual at first.\"This isn't programming in the traditional sense; the method of interacting with these bots is through language,\" Morgan says. \"Asking the program to extract data and then asking it to check if it is sure with normal sentences feels closer to how I train my children to get correct answers than how I usually train computers. It's such a different way to ask a computer to do things. It really changes how you think about what your computer can do.\"Importantly, the technique doesn't require a lot of effort or deep knowledge, according to Polak.\"Previously, people had to write hundreds of lines of code to do something like this, and the results often weren't great,\" Polak says. \"Now we have this huge improvement in capabilities with tools like ChatGPT.\"Morgan is quick to note that integrating AI into research does not replace graduate students and scientists. Instead, these tools could allow researchers to pursue projects they previously didn't have the time, money or people-power to undertake.\"I think these tools will change the way we do research, analogously to how Google changed the way we did research,\" Morgan says. \"Today we typically explore a field by using Google and other search tools to help us find papers and related resources, and then we read those papers and resources to extract information and data. Now you can go to one of these large language models to collect information around a topic and, using techniques like those we've been developing, build a database for review within hours.\" More information:Maciej P.

  "text": "What doesn't smell good is hard to recycle. This simple rule also applies to the growing volume of plastic waste worldwide. One way to recycle it in an environmentally compatible and climate-friendly manner as high-quality post-consumer recyclates is through improved sorting and reprocessing. Until now, the reduced material quality has considerably limited the reuse of plastic recyclates, and this is mainly due to their odor.          Scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Structural Durability and System Reliability LBF have now developed a new environmentally friendly process on a laboratory scale to remove odors from plastic packaging.The new process is based on pressurized water extraction. It removes the tracer fragrance limonene from commercial HDPE packaging and does not require organic solvents. This reduces costs and protects the environment. In this way, the material quality of processed plastic waste can be significantly increased within one hour.The in-process analysis is based on infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry that provide the research team with data on the chemical composition of the samples as a function of different extraction conditions. The analytical data show that significantly less limonene is present in the samples after extraction. Furthermore, in addition to the fragrance, other impurities and short-chain HDPE are removed from the samples that were originally contained in the packaging.Based on these analyses, the Darmstadt experts determined the optimal process parameters for pressurized water extraction of fragrances from HDPE packaging. \"The project results demonstrate the benefits of a systemic approach to solving current plastics technology issues with great social relevance,\" emphasizes Dr. Guru Geertz, who oversees the project at Fraunhofer LBF.Material analysis with machine learning methods optimizes extraction processTo develop the process, detailed insights into the chemical kinetics of the extraction process were necessary, which were made possible by a novel approach for in-process analytics: Evaluating the data with the aid of machine learning methods was the key to optimize the extraction parameters in terms of the desired economical process control. At the current stage of development, an application scenario for the new process is emerging for the improved treatment of plastic waste.\"The extraction process we have developed shows a way to reprocessed single-use plastics with an increased range of applications, and this serves to protect the environment,\" says Dr. Geertz. Due to the underlying concept, the process is equally suitable for industrialized, emerging, and developing countries, so that all market participants who bring plastic products into the trade can potentially benefit from it.

Increasing studies have shown that MOB are present and even active in anoxic environments, without using O2 as an electron acceptor by them, but their survival strategy and ecological contribution are still mysterious.Researchers led by Dr. Li Biao from Prof. Wu Qinglong's team at the Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NIGLAS), together with their collaborators, have investigated the survival strategies of MOB under anoxic conditions. Their results were published in Water Research.After two years of enrichment, the researchers obtained an enriched consortium dominated by \u03b3-MOB, Methylomonas and several other heterotrophic bacteria, but without anaerobic methanotrophs.They found that the MOB consortium can couple CH4 oxidation and Fe(III) reduction under anoxia using electron shuttles such as riboflavin. Within the MOB consortium, MOB converted CH4 to low molecular weight organics such as acetate for the consortium bacteria as a carbon source, while the latter secreted riboflavin to facilitate extracellular electron transfer.\"A metabolic flexibility was observed in this conventionally considered O2-dependent microbe, MOB. Given that iron is the fourth most abundant element on Earth and generally abundant in lacustrine sediments, the use of iron oxides as electron acceptors may be a critical lifestyle for MOB and an important CH4 sink on early Earth, where anoxic conditions are ubiquitous,\" said Dr. Li.In the in situ anoxic sediments, several types of microbes associated with the consortium, including Methylomonas, were transcriptionally active. In addition, Fe(III) reduction coupled with CH4 oxidation mediated by the MOB consortium reduced 40.3% of the CH4 emissions in the iron-rich sediments.\"There are many iron-rich areas in South China, MOB in these iron-rich areas may play a crucial role in mitigating CH4 emission even under anoxia there. Our study reveals how MOBs survive under anoxia and expands the knowledge of this previously overlooked CH4 sink in iron-rich sediments,\" said Dr. Li.

  "text": "A team of materials scientists from NASA working with a colleague from The Ohio State University and another from HX5 LLC has developed a 3D printing process that produces an alloy that is much more resistant to stress than others now in use. Their study is reported in Nature.          As scientists develop new ways to produce energy and explore space, a need has arisen for materials that can survive under extreme conditions\u2014those used to make rocket nozzles, for example. To meet that need, materials scientists have been creating alloys that are ever more resistant to heat and other stressful elements. In this new effort, the research team took a big step forward by developing a 3D process to create an alloy that is much more resilient than anything created thus far.Prior research has shown that adding ceramic to metal alloys gives them more resilience. Unfortunately, adding ceramic has proven to be problematic due to the difference in characteristics of metals and ceramics\u2014the lighter ceramic bits tend to float to the top when added to molten metal. To overcome that problem, the researchers turned to 3D printing.They used an \"ink\" made of a mixture of cobalt, nickel and chrome particles and programmed the printer to add a dusting of yttrium oxide powder to each layer of ink. As the printing progresses, a layer of the metal alloy is printed onto a surface, followed by a fine layer of yttrium oxide particles, which are then heated with a laser, forcing the particles into the metal alloy. The result is a layer of metal alloy infused with tiny pieces of ceramic material. As the process continues, an object is created\u2014a nozzle, for example. The researchers call the new alloy GRX-810.The team tested their new material using the \"creep test,\" whereby a test material is subjected to high temperatures while also carrying a heavy load to provide stress. The longer it lasts, the more resistant the material. Current top materials typically last approximately 10 hours\u2014 GRX-810 lasted for 6,500 hours. More information:Timothy M.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the MIT professor who is also a member of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab?",
  "answer_squad": " Markus Buehler",
  "text": "MIT researchers are using artificial intelligence to design new proteins that go beyond those found in nature.          They have developed machine-learning algorithms that can generate proteins with specific structural features, which could be used to make materials that have certain mechanical properties, like stiffness or elasticity. Such biologically inspired materials could potentially replace materials made from petroleum or ceramics, but with a much smaller carbon footprint.The researchers from MIT, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and Tufts University employed a generative model, which is the same type of machine-learning model architecture used in AI systems like DALL-E 2. But instead of using it to generate realistic images from natural language prompts, like DALL-E 2 does, they adapted the model architecture so it could predict amino acid sequences of proteins that achieve specific structural objectives.In a paper to be published in Chem, the researchers demonstrate how these models can generate realistic, yet novel, proteins. The models, which learn biochemical relationships that control how proteins form, can produce new proteins that could enable unique applications, says senior author Markus Buehler, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering and professor of civil and environmental engineering and of mechanical engineering.For instance, this tool could be used to develop protein-inspired food coatings, which could keep produce fresh longer while being safe for humans to eat. And the models can generate millions of proteins in a few days, quickly giving scientists a portfolio of new ideas to explore, he adds.\"When you think about designing proteins nature has not discovered yet, it is such a huge design space that you can't just sort it out with a pencil and paper. You have to figure out the language of life, the way amino acids are encoded by DNA and then come together to form protein structures. Before we had deep learning, we really couldn't do this,\" says Buehler, who is also a member of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.Joining Buehler on the paper are lead author Bo Ni, a postdoc in Buehler's Laboratory for Atomistic and Molecular Mechanics; and David Kaplan, the Stern Family Professor of Engineering and professor of bioengineering at Tufts.      Adapting new tools for the taskProteins are formed by chains of amino acids, folded together in 3D patterns. The sequence of amino acids determines the mechanical properties of the protein. While scientists have identified thousands of proteins created through evolution, they estimate that an enormous number of amino acid sequences remain undiscovered.To streamline protein discovery, researchers have recently developed deep learning models that can predict the 3D structure of a protein for a set of amino acid sequences. But the inverse problem\u2014predicting a sequence of amino acid structures that meet design targets\u2014has proven even more challenging.A new advent in machine learning enabled Buehler and his colleagues to tackle this thorny challenge: attention-based diffusion models.Attention-based models can learn very long-range relationships, which is key to developing proteins because one mutation in a long amino acid sequence can make or break the entire design, Buehler says. A diffusion model learns to generate new data through a process that involves adding noise to training data, then learning to recover the data by removing the noise. They are often more effective than other models at generating high-quality, realistic data that can be conditioned to meet a set of target objectives to meet a design demand.The researchers used this architecture to build two machine-learning models that can predict a variety of new amino acid sequences which form proteins that meet structural design targets.\"In the biomedical industry, you might not want a protein that is completely unknown because then you don't know its properties. But in some applications, you might want a brand-new protein that is similar to one found in nature, but does something different. We can generate a spectrum with these models, which we control by tuning certain knobs,\" Buehler says.Common folding patterns of amino acids, known as secondary structures, produce different mechanical properties. For instance, proteins with alpha helix structures yield stretchy materials while those with beta sheet structures yield rigid materials. Combining alpha helices and beta sheets can create materials that are stretchy and strong, like silks.The researchers developed two models, one that operates on overall structural properties of the protein and one that operates at the amino acid level. Both models work by combining these amino acid structures to generate proteins. For the model that operates on the overall structural properties, a user inputs a desired percentage of different structures (40% alpha-helix and 60% beta sheet, for instance). Then the model generates sequences that meet those targets. For the second model, the scientist also specifies the order of amino acid structures, which gives much finer-grained control.The models are connected to an algorithm that predicts protein folding, which the researchers use to determine the protein's 3D structure. Then they calculate its resulting properties and check those against the design specifications.Realistic yet novel designsThey tested their models by comparing the new proteins to known proteins that have similar structural properties. Many had some overlap with existing amino acid sequences, about 50% to 60% in most cases, but also some entirely new sequences. The level of similarity suggests that many of the generated proteins are synthesizable, Buehler adds.To ensure the predicted proteins are reasonable, the researchers tried to trick the models by inputting physically impossible design targets. They were impressed to see that, instead of producing improbable proteins, the models generated the closest synthesizable solution.\"The learning algorithm can pick up the hidden relationships in nature. This gives us confidence to say that whatever comes out of our model is very likely to be realistic,\" Ni says.Next, the researchers plan to experimentally validate some of the new protein designs by making them in a lab. They also want to continue augmenting and refining the models so they can develop amino acid sequences that meet more criteria, such as biological functions.\"For the applications we are interested in, like sustainability, medicine, food, health, and materials design, we are going to need to go beyond what nature has done. Here is a new design tool that we can use to create potential solutions that might help us solve some of the really pressing societal issues we are facing,\" Buehler says. More information:Markus J.

  "text": "There are high expectations that quantum computers may deliver revolutionary new possibilities for simulating chemical processes. This could have a major impact on everything from the development of new pharmaceuticals to new materials. Researchers at Chalmers University have now, for the first time in Sweden, used a quantum computer to undertake calculations within a real-life case in chemistry.          \"Quantum computers could in theory be used to handle cases where electrons and atomic nuclei move in more complicated ways. If we can learn to utilize their full potential, we should be able to advance the boundaries of what is possible to calculate and understand,\" says Martin Rahm, Associate Professor in Theoretical Chemistry at the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, who has led the study.Within the field of quantum chemistry, the laws of quantum mechanics are used to understand which chemical reactions are possible, which structures and materials can be developed, and what characteristics they have. Such studies are normally undertaken with the help of super computers, built with conventional logical circuits. There is however a limit for which calculations conventional computers can handle. Because the laws of quantum mechanics describe the behavior of nature on a subatomic level, many researchers believe that a quantum computer should be better equipped to perform molecular calculations than a conventional computer.\"Most things in this world are inherently chemical. For example, our energy carriers, within biology as well as in old or new cars, are made up of electrons and atomic nuclei arranged in different ways in molecules and materials. Some of the problems we solve in the field of quantum chemistry are to calculate which of these arrangements are more likely or advantageous, along with their characteristics,\" says Martin Rahm.A new method minimizes errors in the quantum chemical calculationsThere is still a way to go before quantum computers can achieve what the researchers are aiming for. This field of research is still young and the small model calculations that are run are complicated by noise from the quantum computer's surroundings. However, Martin Rahm and his colleagues have now found a method that they see as an important step forward. The method is called Reference-State Error Mitigation (REM) and works by correcting for the errors that occur due to noise by utilizing the calculations from both a quantum computer and a conventional computer.\"The study is a proof-of-concept that our method can improve the quality of quantum-chemical calculations. It is a useful tool that we will use to improve our calculations on quantum computers moving forward,\" says Martin Rahm. The article, \"Reference-State Error Mitigation: A Strategy for High Accuracy Quantum Computation of Chemistry,\" is published in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation.The principle behind the method is to first consider a reference state by describing and solving the same problem on both a conventional and a quantum computer. This reference state represents a simpler description of a molecule than the original problem intended to be solved by the quantum computer. A conventional computer can solve this simpler version of the problem quickly. By comparing the results from both computers, an exact estimate can be made for the amount of error caused by noise. The difference between the two computers' solutions for the reference problem can then be used to correct the solution for the original, more complex, problem when it is run on the quantum processor.By combining this new method with data from Chalmers' quantum computer S\u00e4rimner the researchers have succeeded in calculating the intrinsic energy of small example molecules such as hydrogen and lithium hydride. Equivalent calculations can be carried out more quickly on a conventional computer, but the new method represents an important development and is the first demonstration of a quantum chemical calculation on a quantum computer in Sweden.\"We see good possibilities for further development of the method to allow calculations of larger and more complex molecules, when the next generation of quantum computers are ready,\" says Martin Rahm.      Quantum computer built at ChalmersThe research has been conducted in close collaboration with colleagues at the Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience. They have built the quantum computers that are used in the study, and helped perform the sensitive measurements that are needed for the chemical calculations.\"It is only by using real quantum algorithms that we can understand how our hardware really works and how we can improve it. Chemical calculations are one of the first areas where we believe that quantum computers will be useful, so our collaboration with Martin Rahm's group is especially valuable,\" says Jonas Bylander, Associate Professor in Quantum Technology at the Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience.

  "text": "The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into C2+ products such as ethylene is a promising path toward the carbon neutral goal, but it remains a big challenge due to the high activation barrier for CO2 and similar reduction potentials of many possible multi-electron transfer products.          In a study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the research group led by Prof. Cao Rong and Prof. Huang Yuanbiao from Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter of the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported a tandem photocatalysis strategy to support conversion of CO2 to ethylene.The researchers developed this tandem photocatalysis strategy by the construction of the synergistic dual sites in rhenium-(I) bipyridine fac-[ReI(bpy)(CO)3Cl] (Re-bpy) and copper-porphyrinic triazine framework (PTF(Cu)). With these two catalysts, they produced a large amount of ethylene at a rate of 73.2 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1 under visible light irradiation. Ethylene cannot be obtained from CO2 by the use of either component of the Re-bpy or PTF(Cu). Only monocarbon product CO is produced under similar conditions with a single catalyst.In the tandem photocatalytic system, the researchers found that the CO generated at the Re-bpy sites was adsorbed by the nearby Cu single sites in PTF(Cu), and this was followed by a synergistic C-C coupling process which ultimately produces ethylene.Based on the analysis of the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the researchers photoreduced CO2 to Re-bpy-CO* over the Re-bpy, from which some of the CO can be desorbed and moved to the nearby PTF(Cu) where it is adsorbed by the single-atomic Cu site to form PTF(Cu)-CO*.Additionally, the C-C coupling occurred in the synergy of the intermediates PTF(Cu)-CO* and Re-bpy-CO* to form Re-*CO-CO*-Cu, which was finally reduced and released as ethylene with multistep proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) processes. DFT calculations demonstrated that the coupling process between PTF(Cu)-*CO and Re-bpy-*CO to form the key intermediate Re-bpy-*CO-*CO-PTF(Cu) is vital to the C2H4 production.This study provides a new way for the design of efficient photocatalysts for photocoversion of CO2 to C2 products via a tandem process driven by visible-light under mild conditions.

  "answer_squad": " Ac-225",
  "text": "Thanks to a recent upgrade to the medical isotope facilities at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory, actinium-225 (Ac-225), an isotope that shows great promise for treating cancer, can now be produced, purified, and shipped ready for use directly from the Lab. The first shipment left Brookhaven in mid-March.          \"This upgrade will streamline the overall production and distribution of Ac-225 to research centers by eliminating the need to ship material off site for final processing,\" said Cathy Cutler, Director of Medical Isotope Research & Production (MIRP) at Brookhaven Lab.The promise of Ac-225 stems from the way this radioactive isotope decays. It emits alpha particles, which can deliver a lethal punch to cancerous cells over a short distance. Attaching Ac-225 to molecules that target tumors could potentially kill cancer cells without harming surrounding tissue. Ac-225 can also be used to generate bismuth-213, another alpha-emitter.Since 2014, MIRP scientists have been part of the DOE Isotope Program \"Tri-Lab\" effort to produce Ac-225 (and Ac-225/Bi-213 generators) so doctors can run clinical trials to test its efficacy. Using powerful proton accelerators, scientists at Brookhaven and Los Alamos National Laboratory irradiate targets made of thorium-232. The proton bombardment transforms some of the thorium atoms into actinium-225. Both Brookhaven and Los Alamos have been shipping their irradiated targets to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which has the facilities to extract and purify the isotope.\"Dmitri Medvedev of MIRP played a huge role in making this happen, both developing the targets we use at the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer (BLIP) and collaborating on the way we process alpha emitters with the Tri-Lab team,\" Cutler said.This Tri-Lab effort established reliable, routine Ac-225 production, and demonstrated that the process is scalable. But the availability of \"hot-cell\" space\u2014the specialized labs and equipment needed for processing radioactive materials\u2014limited how much Ac-225 could be made.                This long-exposure image makes it possible to see the glow of actinium-225, an isotope that shows great promise for treating cancer. Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory             In 2018, the Brookhaven team and DOE worked out a solution. With an $8.5 million investment from the DOE Science Laboratories Infrastructure program, they began refurbishing an old metallurgical laboratory that had been dormant at Brookhaven since the 1990s. The renovation, led by Brian McCaffrey of Brookhaven Lab's Facilities & Operations Directorate, included retrofitting the obsolete hot cell facility and labs to create a new All-Purpose (AP) Hot Cell facility to enhance Brookhaven's Isotope Program processing capabilities.      \"ORNL aided us in translating the process here. We also had to get special licensing and install new radiation-monitoring equipment,\" Cutler said.Brookhaven's new AP hot cells, completed in March, have doubled the number of Ac-225 processing sites for DOE's Isotope Program. This expanded processing capacity provides redundancy so Brookhaven and ORNL can serve as backups for each other.There are clear benefits in having both target irradiation and hot cells for processing at one laboratory. It establishes a more efficient path for producing larger Ac-225 batch sizes by removing the logistical challenges inherent in involving multiple labs and transporting targets.\"Now we can irradiate the targets and process them right here at Brookhaven so that Ac-225 can be shipped directly to research centers,\" Cutler said.The hope is that this accelerator-produced supply of Ac-225 will advance the development of promising cancer treatments\u2014and ultimately support the market demands of therapies that get approved.

  "answer_squad": " Bk-249",
  "text": "Researchers need a better way to extract individual heavy metal elements, called actinides, to obtain a purer product. In 2018, researchers discovered that the actinide berkelium, when oxidized, does not form negatively charged ions in solutions of high nitric acid, as other actinides do. This meant an anion exchange column could separate berkelium by absorbing other actinides with negatively charged ions.          This system moves berkelium dissolved in highly concentrated nitric acid through a series of columns. The top column blocks negatively charged impurities. The lower column collects berkelium while positively charged impurities pass through. Nitric acid then strips purified berkelium from the lower column. This produced the world's purest Bk-249 to date.The extraction of individual actinides is essential for improving nuclear fuel recycling and nuclear waste management. This new method is much faster than the previous approach, taking just eight days compared to eight weeks. It is also easier, cleaner, and yields purer product. This could be applied toward the production of heavy actinides.If berkelium's state allows it to chemically bond, it can be directly extracted from a mixture of other actinides. This is useful when researchers want only berkelium from a complex solution. In addition, this method could be applied to other separations\u2014for example, rare einsteinium and fermium.By replacing the original multi-drying-down and multi-column runs with a single dual column run, the new method for purifying berkelium results in historically high radiochemical purity of the finished product\u201497.25 percent purity, compared to 93.9 percent for the previous method. The new process also is significantly quicker and simpler, leaving less room for error. Instead of needing sensitive pH adjustments, temperature control and drop counts, the new method achieves the separation of metal ions by easy operations at room temperature.The first member of the second half of the actinide series, berkelium can be used to learn more about the behavior of heavier elements, whose studies are limited by very short half-lives, very high radioactivity, and very short supply. Currently, berkelium's primary use is in heavy element research.For example, its most stable isotope, Bk-249, played a significant role in the creation of superheavy element 117, tennessine. A byproduct of californium-252 production at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Bk-249 was irradiated in a calcium-48 beam by an international research collaboration to create a half-dozen atoms of the element tennessine.The research is published in the Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry.

  "text": "Lignin depolymerization is playing a pivotal role in transforming the second most abundant type of biopolymer in nature into many valuable chemicals/fuels. This route could directly replace their petrol-based equivalents and therefore presents a great pathway to fight climate change and contribute to future sustainability.          Interpretation of the reaction pathways helps with gaining an insightful mechanic view in understanding the depolymerization chemistry and paving new paths for lignin valorization at the industrial scale. However, such interpretation heavily relies on the state-of-art analytical capability, since in the process there are many oligomeric products formed but not well-characterized due to the limited instrumental analysis choices.A team of scientists, therefore, summarized the considerable progress in the formation and identification of lignin oligomeric products in recent years. Both the existing and expected potential valorization routes are discussed, and technical hurdles and recommendations are provided in an attempt to catalyze the development of new discoveries and enabling technologies. The work is published in Industrial Chemistry & Materials.\"Analyzing the oligomeric products from lignin polymerization is playing important role in transforming the renewable lignin polymer to many valuable chemicals and fuels,\" said Seema Singh, a director of biomass deconstruction division at Joint Bioenergy Institute.\"In this review, we systematically discussed the recent development of identification of the oligomeric products from various lignin depolymerization, thus revealing the mechanical insight of the processes and to provide helpful guidance for understanding the formation of such oligomers chemically. We also provided our perspectives on the existing and expected potential valorization routes for the oligomers as well as discussed the remaining challenges to this field.\"Common targeted products from lignin depolymerization are monomeric phenols, aromatics, cycloalkanes, and dicarboxylic acids. The large scale of one such process can be exemplified by the industrial production of vanillin through oxidative catalytic depolymerization.The relatively low cost of the substrate and the ease of operation counteract the fact that the yield of vanillin is often not high, which overall still makes this process economically viable. The same logic, however, may not be well applied to other lignin-valorization routes, such as reductive catalytic depolymerization, which is often a pre-treatment of lignin (via hydrogenolysis) if the final products are fuel-ranged cycloalkanes.      A similar dilemma also exists in the thermochemical treatment of lignin. Regardless of the chemical treatments, oligomeric fractions from any lignin depolymerization are inevitably formed as the side products, and in many cases, can be the major products as well. The inherent causes, although not very clear so far, have been extensively discussed in many studies.One of the commonly agreed viewpoints is the unavoidable participation of the crosslinking/repolymerization reactions during the proceeding of various lignin depolymerizations. Major efforts, therefore, had been made to mitigate the repolymerization processes.\"The depolymerization of lignin provides access to a new dimension of the utilization of lignin-based materials,\" said Blake Simmons, director of Biological System and Engineering Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, \"In order to improve processes of bioenergy/bioproducts, more research efforts should emphasize on the reactivity and selectivity of depolymerized lignin oligomers. There is huge room to control the structure, molecular weight, branching, and functional complexity to adapt lignin to various valorization processes.\"\"So far, we don't know if repolymerization is the only explanation for the formation of the oligomeric products or not, but there have been enough publications, especially in recent years, reporting that the formation could be sometimes also due to other reasons depends on the condition,\" said Yinglei Han, a postdoctoral researcher at Joint Bioenergy Institute and Sandia National Laboratories.\"We therefore highly motivated to summarize all the options and present an overview on elucidating the formation causes. Presently, three routes have been identified and established to reveal the formation of the oligomeric products during various depolymerization.\"\"One of the biggest technical hurdles in achieving this potential is the difficulty in identifying all depolymerization products,\" said Han, \"The oligomers are indispensable pieces if one wants to gain an insightful mechanistic view of the process or to valorize them. Such difficulty could mainly be attributed to the structural heterogeneity of lignin which could significantly diversify the derived oligomeric products compared to the depolymerization of those petroleum-based polymers (e.g., polyethylene, polystyrene).\"The state-of-the-art methods for characterizing these oligomeric products are Two-dimensional Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Elite) and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, combined with other less informative instrumental analyses, such as UV/vis, UV-florescence, pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrum, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.All these techniques combined, however, are still inadequate for distinguishing and then quantifying each oligomer. More efforts are needed in this aspect in the future, which is pivotal in utilizing these oligomeric products in many other applications.\"The reported pathways for the valorization of such oligomeric products can be generally categorized into three, 1) further depolymerization for more phenolic monomers, 2) modification of lignin oligomers into value-added materials, and 3) decomposition to short-chain dicarboxylic acids or even hydrogen gas,\" Han said, \"Several new ideas have recently been proposed and tested for utilizing lignin oligomers, such as transformation to photocatalyst, antioxidant, or use as a battery binder.\"\"In this review, our main goal is to provide readers with timely and accurate latest research progress on oligomeric product formation during depolymerization, which is a much-needed topic in the lignin valorization field,\" Singh said.

  "text": "A pair of chemists at Cornell University has extended the scope of carbonyl olefination reactions by developing a new electrophotocatalytic process. In their paper published in the journal Science Advances, Keri Steiniger and Tristan Lambert describe their new process and the situations in which it might be used.          Olefins (a class of unsaturated, open-chain hydrocarbons) are often used as the basis for organic synthesis in the manufacture of plastics, the processing of petrochemicals and preparation of many types of rubbers\u2014but they have a drawback: They generally involve use of a strong base, which tends to limit tolerance of functional groups during reactions.In this new effort, the researchers used electrophotocatalysis to extend the scope of such reactions. In their process, electrophotocatalytic and electrochemical oxidations are paired to create intermediates in a way that can be controlled. It also allows alkenes, which serve as olefination agents, to react with both ketones and aldehydes. As the reaction occurs, two main byproducts are released\u2014hydrogen and nitrogen gases. They acknowledge that the process looks a bit unorthodox when viewed from a distance, but insist that in practice, it works quite well.In the new process, a diazo compound is generated electrochemically from an organic carbonyl (any of a functional group made up of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom) along with a hydrazine (a volatile alkaline liquid). Due to cycloaddition, a cyclic diazene is produced along with the desired alkene.As nitrogen is lost, a distonic radical cation reduction leaves the target olefin. The researchers note that the reaction allows for controlling the rate at which the electrons are transferred, which in turn allows for the conversion to an olefin, as opposed to a cyclopropane. They also note that the process can be used with a broad range of unactivated alkenes.In addition to broadening the scope of carbonyl olefination reactions, the new process also allows for creating olefins without production of wastes typically associated with their syntheses. The research team suggests it could also be used as an alternative to Witting olefination, allowing the creation of a host of new products, including some in the pharmaceutical industry.

  "text": "A team of UCR electrical engineers and material scientists demonstrated a research breakthrough that may result in wide-ranging advancements in electrical, optical, and computer technologies.          The Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering research group, led by distinguished professor Alexander Balandin, has shown in the laboratory the unique and practical function of newly created materials, which they called quantum composites.These composites consist of small crystals of called \"charge density wave quantum materials\" incorporated within a polymer (large molecules with repeating structures) matrix. Upon heating or light exposure, charge density wave material undergoes a phase transition that leads to an unusual electrical response of the composites.Compared to other materials that reveal quantum phenomena, the quantum composites created by Balandin's group exhibited functionality at a much wider range of temperatures and had a greatly increased ability to store electricity, giving them an excellent potential for utility.The University of California, Riverside, researchers describe the unique properties in a paper titled \"Quantum Composites with Charge-Density-Wave Fillers\" published in the journal Advanced Materials. The lead authors of the paper are Zahra Barani and Tekwam Geremew, UCR graduate students with the college's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, who synthesized and tested the composites. Another UCR graduate student Maedeh Taheri is a co-author who helped with electrical measurements. Balandin and Fariborz Kargar, an assistant adjunct professor and project scientist, are the corresponding authors.The term quantum refers to materials and devices where electrons behave more like waves than particles. The wave nature of electrons can give materials unusual properties that are used in a new generation of computer, electronic and optic technologies.Materials that reveal quantum phenomena are sought for building quantum computers that go beyond the limitations of most computing that is now based on chips that use binary bits for computations. Such materials are also sought for super-sensitive sensors used for various electronic and optic applications.But the materials with quantum phenomena have major drawbacks, Balandin said.      \"The problem with these materials is that the quantum phenomena are fragile and typically observed only at extremely low temperatures,\" he said. \"The defects and impurities destroy the electron wave function.\"Remarkably, the charge density wave material in the quantum composites created by Balandin's lab exhibited functionality as high as 50\u00baC above room temperature. This transition temperature is close to the temperature of the operation of computers and other electronic gadgets, which heat up when they operate. This temperature tolerance opens a possibility for a wide range of applications of quantum composites in electronics and energy storage.The researchers also found that quantum composites have an unusually high dielectric constant\u2014a metric that characterizes the material's ability to store electricity. The dielectric constant of the electrically insulating composites increased by more than two orders of magnitude, which allows for smaller and more powerful capacitors used for energy storage.\"Energy storage capacitors can be found in battery-powered applications,\" Balandin said. \"Capacitors can be used to deliver peak power and provide energy for computer memory during an unexpected shut-off. Capacitors can charge and discharge faster compared to batteries. In order to broaden the use of capacitors for energy storage, one needs to increase the energy per volume. Our quantum composite material may help to achieve this goal.\"Another possible application for quantum composites is reflective coating. The change in the dielectric constant induced by heating, light exposure, or application of an electrical field can be used to change the light reflection from the glasses and windows coated with such composites.\"We hope that our ability to preserve the quantum condensate phases in the charge-density-wave materials even inside disordered composites and even above room temperature can become a game changer for many applications. It is a conceptually different approach for tuning the properties of composites that we use in everyday life,\" Balandin added.

  "answer_squad": " LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl",
  "text": "Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are a promising solution to the contemporary problem of the impending global energy crisis. SOFCs show high efficiency, lower emissions, and have low operating costs, making them an ideal power source for a fossil fuel-free society.          Conventional SOFCs with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes have high operating temperatures (700\u00b0C\u20131000\u00b0C), and their widespread adoption has been limited by their degradation issues and high cost. Therefore, there is a need to search for new materials exhibiting high conductivities and stability at low temperatures (100\u00b0C\u2013300\u00b0C). While some bismuth(Bi)-containing materials exhibit high oxide-ion conductivities through the conventional vacancy diffusion mechanism, they are not very stable under reduced atmospheres. As an alternative, the interstitialcy migration mechanism, involving the knock-on motion of interstitial and lattice oxide ions, has attracted much attention. However, they are rarely observed in Bi-containing materials.A team of researchers from Japan led by Prof. Masatomo Yashima of Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) put their heads together to find a solution to these problems. In their recent breakthrough published in Advanced Functional Materials, the team reported a new Bi-containing compound, LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl, where the oxide ions migrate via the interstitialcy mechanism. The team demonstrated that LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl exhibits both high stability and a high oxide-ion conductivity that is superior to those of even the best oxide-ion conductors at low temperatures (below 201\u00b0C).When asked how the team was able to discover LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl, Prof. Yashima explains, \"Most known Bi-containing materials exhibit high oxide-ion conductivities via the conventional vacancy diffusion mechanism. The alternative mechanism, interstitialcy diffusion, is rare in these materials. Thus, we specifically searched for Bi-containing materials with interstitial oxygen site that could enable the interstitialcy diffusion.\"The interstitial oxygen site refers to the empty space within a crystal structure the oxide ions partially occupy. Prof. Yashima's group selected a Bi-containing Sill\u00e9n oxychloride, LaBi2O4Cl, with a triple fluorite-like layer to ensure the presence of such interstitial oxygen sites. They then partially substituted the Bi3+ cation with a high valence dopant, tellurium (Te) cation Te4+, in the Sill\u00e9n phase LaBi2O4Cl to increase the amount of interstitial oxygen atoms (x/2) in LaBi2\u2013xTexO4+x/2Cl. The chemical composition, LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl (x = 0.1 in LaBi1\u2013xTexO4+x/2Cl), was then chosen for detailed experimental and computational studies since the bulk conductivity of LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl was the highest among those of all the other compositions, i.e., LaBi2\u2013xTexO4+x/2Cl (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.2).      The team found that LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl exhibits high chemical and electrical stability at 400\u00b0C in a wide oxygen partial pressure region between 10\u221225 to 0.2 atm, as well as a high chemical stability in CO2, wet H2 in N2, and air with natural humidity. Further, LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl demonstrated a high oxide-ion conductivity of 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 S cm\u22121 at 702\u00b0C. The bulk conductivity of the material was significantly higher than those of the best oxide-ion conductors such as Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 at temperatures between 96\u00b0C\u2013201\u00b0C.To elucidate the mechanism underlying the high oxide-ion conduction, the team performed neutron-diffraction experiments, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and DFT calculations. The results indicated that the extremely high oxide-ion conduction is explained by an interstitialcy migration of oxide ions through the lattice and interstitial sites, which is a rare occurrence in Bi-containing materials.The discovery of the high oxide ionic conductivity along with high chemical and electrical stability of LaBi1.9Te0.1O4.05Cl, and the unique mechanism underlying the high conductivity will open door to further research on Bi-containing compounds and Sill\u00e9n phases, and eventually to high-performance SOFC electrolytes at low temperatures.\"There were studies on the photocatalysis and luminescence of Sill\u00e9n phases in the research literature. In our study, we have now demonstrated that Sill\u00e9n Bi-containing oxychlorides can also act as promising electrolytes for SOFCs and could contribute to the fuel cell revolution,\" concludes Prof. Yashima.

  "text": "Plants that glow under ultraviolet (UV) light aren't just inventions of science fiction TV and movies. Roots of a traditional medicine plant called the orange climber, or Toddalia asiatica, can fluoresce an ethereal blue hue. And now, researchers have identified two coumarin molecules that could be responsible. These natural coumarins have unique fluorescent properties, and one of the compounds could someday be used for medical imaging. Their study is published in ACS Central Science.       Fluorescent substances take in UV light that is directed on them and release vibrantly colored visible light. And some glow even more brightly when they are close together, a phenomenon seen in compounds called aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). They are key components in some optical devices, cellular imaging techniques and environmental sensors. However, these molecules are usually made in a lab, and many are toxic. Some plants already have this ability, so, Ben Zhong Tang, Zheng Zhao, Xiao-Dong Luo and colleagues turned to nature to find naturally occurring and safer AIEgens.The researchers dried orange climber roots, crushed them into a powder, and then isolated and identified coumarin compounds with aggregation-induced emission properties: 5-methoxyseselin (5-MOS) and 6-methoxyseselin (6-MOS). When dissolved in an organic solvent, 5-MOS exhibited a blue-green glow and 6-MOS had a slightly dimmer blue glow. In addition, both AIEgens had low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility.Then in a final series of experiments, the team found that mitochondria could be clearly identified in live cells stained with 5-MOS without any additional processing, making cell imaging easier and faster than with most current methods. The newly reported compound is a natural, plant-derived option that could advance bioimaging, the researchers say.

  "text": "In a project commissioned by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), researchers at Nagoya University in Japan have developed poly(styrenesulfonic acid)-based PEMs with a high density of sulfonic acid groups.          One of the key components of environmentally friendly polymer electrolyte fuel cells is a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM). It generates electrical energy through a reaction between hydrogen and oxygen gases. Examples of practical fuel cells include fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and fuel cell combined heat and power (CHP) systems.The best-known PEM is a membrane based on a perfluorosulfonic acid polymer, such as Nafion, which was developed by DuPont in the 1960s. It has a good proton conductivity of 0.1 S/cm at 70-90 \u00b0C under humidified conditions. Under these conditions, protons can be released from sulfonic acid groups.Proton conduction in such membranes typically depends on the proton transport mechanism between protons, sulfonic acid groups, and water molecules. Typically, the higher the density of the sulfonic acid groups in the membrane, the higher the density of protons that can be released from the sulfonic acid groups; therefore, the higher density of the sulfonic acid groups usually results in higher proton conductivities.However, using a conventional synthesis process, it is difficult to synthesize PEMs with a high density of sulfonic acid groups. For instance, to increase the density of sulfonic acid groups in a poly(styrenesulfonic acid)-based PEM, the sulfonation reaction must be carried out over long hours or under severe conditions. It usually uses highly oxidizing substances, such as fuming sulfuric acid and chlorosulfonic acid.Unfortunately, this leads to undesirable side reactions, such as cleavage of the backbone chains of the polymer. Therefore, to avoid unwanted side reactions during polymer synthesis, commercially available PEMs are usually synthesized to have a low density of sulfonic acid groups. For commercially available Nafion or poly(styrenesulfonic acid)-based PEMs such as Selemion by AGC, the ion exchange capacity (IEC), an index of the density of acid groups, is typically less than 1.0 meq/g.In the paper, Atsushi Noro and colleagues at the Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University and from the Institutes of Innovation for Future Society also Nagoya University, have developed poly(styrenesulfonic acid)-based PEM with an ultrahigh density of sulfonic acid groups.The IEC of the PEM was 5.0 meq/g. This is five times higher than the IEC of typical commercially available PEMs such as Nafion or Selemion. Its proton conductivity at 80\u00b0C under 90%RH (a common operating condition for polymer electrolyte fuel cells) was 0.93 S/cm. This is six times higher than the conductivity of Nafion (0.15 S/cm) or Selemion (0.091 S/cm) under the same measurement conditions.Future fuel cells must be operated under more severe operating conditions such as higher temperatures and lower humidities. This study will contribute to the synthesis and development of next-generation higher-performance PEMs exhibiting a good conductivity of 0.1 S/cm or higher under such severe conditions. The study will also contribute to the goal of reaching a net-zero carbon society.

  "text": "Among all greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide is the highest contributor to global warming. If we do not take action by 2100, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the average temperature of our world will increase by about 34 degrees Fahrenheit. Finding effective ways to capture and store CO2 has been a challenge for researchers and industries focused on combating global warming, and Amir Barati Farimani has been working to change that.          \"Machine learning models bear the promise for discovering new chemical compounds or materials to fight against global warming,\" explains Barati Farimani, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. \"Machine learning models can achieve accurate and efficient virtual screening of CO2 storage candidates and may even generate preferable compounds that never existed before.\"Barati Farimani has made a breakthrough using machine learning to identify ionic liquid molecules. Ionic liquids (ILs) are families of molten salt that remain in a liquid state at room temperature, have high chemical stability and high CO2 solubility, making them ideal candidates for CO2 storage. The combination of ions largely determines the properties of ILs. However, such combinatorial possibilities of cations and anions make it extremely challenging to exhaust the design space of ILs for efficient CO2 storage through conventional experiments.Machine learning is often used in drug discovery to create so-called molecular fingerprints alongside graph neural networks (GNNs) that treat molecules as graphs and use a matrix to identify molecular bonds and related properties. For the first time, Barati Farimani has developed both fingerprint-based ML models and GNNs that are able to predict the CO2 absorption in ionic liquids.\"Our GNN method achieves superior accuracy in predicting the CO2 solubility in ion liquids,\" states Barati Farimani. \"Unlike previous ML methods that rely on handcrafted features, GNN directly learns the features from molecular graphs.\"Understanding how machine learning models make decisions is just as important as the molecular properties they identify. This explanation provides researchers with extra insight into how the structure of the molecule affects the property of ionic liquids from a data-driven perspective. For example, Barati Farmimani's team found that molecular fragments that physically interact with CO2 are less important than those that have a chemical interaction. Additionally, those with less hydrogen connected to nitrogen could be more favorable in formalizing a stable chemical interaction with CO2.These findings, published in ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering, will enable researchers to advise on the design of novel and efficient ionic liquids for CO2 storage in the future.

  "answer_race": " Hydrogels Keep Taking Water",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the hydrogel commonly used in cosmetic creams?",
  "answer_squad": " polyethylene glycol",
  "text": "The vast majority of absorbent materials will lose their ability to retain water as temperatures rise. This is why our skin starts to sweat and why plants dry out in the heat. Even materials that are designed to soak up moisture, such as the silica gel packs in consumer packaging, will lose their sponge-like properties as their environment heats up.          But one material appears to uniquely resist heat's drying effects. MIT engineers have now found that polyethylene glycol (PEG)\u2014a hydrogel commonly used in cosmetic creams, industrial coatings, and pharmaceutical capsules\u2014can absorb moisture from the atmosphere even as temperatures climb.The material doubles its water absorption as temperatures climb from 25 to 50 degrees Celsius (77 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit), the team reports.PEG's resilience stems from a heat-triggering transformation. As its surroundings heat up, the hydrogel's microstructure morphs from a crystal to a less organized \"amorphous\" phase, which enhances the material's ability to capture water.Based on PEG's unique properties, the team developed a model that can be used to engineer other heat-resistant, water-absorbing materials. The group envisions such materials could one day be made into devices that harvest moisture from the air for drinking water, particularly in arid desert regions. The materials could also be incorporated into heat pumps and air conditioners to more efficiently regulate temperature and humidity.\"A huge amount of energy consumption in buildings is used for thermal regulation,\" says Lenan Zhang, a research scientist in MIT's Department of Mechanical Engineering. \"This material could be a key component of passive climate-control systems.\"Zhang and his colleagues detail their work in a study appearing today in Advanced Materials. MIT co-authors include Xinyue Liu, Bachir El Fil, Carlos Diaz-Marin, Yang Zhong, Xiangyu Li, and Evelyn Wang, along with Shaoting Lin of Michigan State University.Against intuitionEvelyn Wang's group in MIT's Device Research Lab aims to address energy and water challenges through the design of new materials and devices that sustainably manage water and heat. The team discovered PEG's unusual properties as they were assessing a slew of similar hydrogels for their water-harvesting abilities.\"We were looking for a high-performance material that could capture water for different applications,\" Zhang says. \"Hydrogels are a perfect candidate, because they are mostly made of water and a polymer network. They can simultaneously expand as they absorb water, making them ideal for regulating humidity and water vapor.\"The team analyzed a variety of hydrogels, including PEG, by placing each material on a scale that was set within a climate-controlled chamber. A material became heavier as it absorbed more moisture. By recording a material's changing weight, the researchers could track its ability to absorb moisture as they tuned the chamber's temperature and humidity.What they observed was typical of most materials: as the temperature increased, the hyrogels' ability to capture moisture from the air decreased. The reason for this temperature-dependence is well-understood: With heat comes motion, and at higher temperatures, water molecules move faster and are therefore more difficult to contain in most materials.\"Our intuition tells us that at higher temperatures, materials tend to lose their ability to capture water,\" says co-author Xinyue Liu. \"So, we were very surprised by PEG because it has this inverse relationship.\"In fact, they found that PEG grew heavier and continued to absorb water as the researchers raised the chamber's temperature from 25 to 50 degrees Celsius.\"At first, we thought we had measured some errors, and thought this could not be possible,\" Liu says. \"After we double-checked everything was correct in the experiment, we realized this was really happening, and this is the only known material that shows increasing water absorbing ability with higher temperature.\"      A lucky catchThe group zeroed in on PEG to try and identify the reason for its unusual, heat-resilient performance. They found that the material has a natural melting point at around 50 degrees Celsius, meaning that the hydrogel's normally crystal-like microstructure completely breaks down and transforms into an amorphous phase. Zhang says that this melted, amorphous phase provides more opportunity for polymers in the material to grab hold of any fast-moving water molecules.\"In the crystal phase, there might be only a few sites on a polymer available to attract water and bind,\" Zhang says. \"But in the amorphous phase, you might have many more sites available. So, the overall performance can increase with increased temperature.\"The team then developed a theory to predict how hydrogels absorb water, and showed that the theory could also explain PEG's unusual behavior if the researchers added a \"missing term\" to the theory. That missing term was the effect of phase transformation. They found that when they included this effect, the theory could predict PEG's behavior, along with that of other temperature-limiting hydrogels.The discovery of PEG's unique properties was in large part by chance. The material's melting temperature just happens to be within the range where water is a liquid, enabling them to catch PEG's phase transformation and its resulting super-soaking behavior. The other hydrogels happen to have melting temperatures that fall outside this range. But the researchers suspect that these materials are also capable of similar phase transformations once they hit their melting temperatures.\"Other polymers could in theory exhibit this same behavior, if we can engineer their melting points within a selected temperature range,\" says team member Shaoting Lin.Now that the group has worked out a theory, they plan to use it as a blueprint to design materials specifically for capturing water at higher temperatures.\"We want to customize our design to make sure a material can absorb a relatively high amount of water, at low humidity and high temperatures,\" Liu says. \"Then it could be used for atmospheric water harvesting, to bring people potable water in hot, arid environments.\" More information:Xinyue Liu et al, Unusual Temperature Dependence of Water Sorption in Semicrystalline Hydrogels, Advanced Materials (2023).

  "text": "Today, over half of the total energy produced from fossil fuels is discarded as waste heat, which accelerates global warming. If we could convert the waste heat into a more useful form of energy like electricity, we could minimize fuel consumption and reduce our carbon footprint. In this regard, thermoelectric energy conversion has gained momentum as a technology for generating electricity from waste heat.          For efficient conversion, a thermoelectric material must have a high conversion efficiency (ZT). So far, realizing a high ZT has been possible only with the use of heavy elements like lead, bismuth, and tellurium. However, the use of rare, expensive, and environmentally toxic elements such as these has limited the large-scale application of thermoelectric energy conversion.To tackle these issues, transition metal oxides based on platforms such as SrTiO3 have emerged as a more inexpensive and benign alternative. However, their ZT is typically limited by a high thermal conductivity (\u03ba), since for a high \u03ba, the temperature across the material becomes uniform more quickly, and the lowered temperature difference\u2014the driving force behind the thermoelectric conversion\u2014causes electric power generation to decrease as well.Against this backdrop, a research team including Associate Professor Takayoshi Katase from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan recently discovered a new approach to reducing \u03ba and boosting the performance of SrTiO3 by hydrogen substitution.Conventionally, the use of light elements is expected to increase the \u03ba originating from lattice vibration (\u03balat), leading to the adoption of heavy elements to reduce the \u03balat. In contrast, in their study published in Advanced Functional Materials, the team discovered that the \u03balat of SrTiO3 could be reduced to less than half its original value by substituting a light element, namely hydrogen.They clarified the mechanism underlying their observation using first-principles calculations, which showed that substituting a portion of the oxygen anions (O\u2212) with hydrogen anions (H\u2212), yielding compounds of the form SrTiO3\u2212xHx, results in a mixture comprising a strong Ti-O bond and a weak Ti-H bond. These randomly distributed Ti-(O,H) bonds, in turn, largely decrease \u03balat.The team also found that SrTiO3\u2212xHx polycrystals exhibit high electron mobility comparable to that of single-crystal materials without any deterioration in electron conduction across grain boundaries. Based on these two effects, a low thermal conductivity along with a high electrical output power are realized at the same time, resulting in an improved thermoelectric conversion efficiency in the SrTiO3\u2212xHx polycrystal.Overall, these findings can open doors to innovative strategies for developing next-generation thermoelectric materials. \"In future, the hydrogen substitution approach would realize excellent environmentally benign thermoelectric materials that do not require the use of heavy elements,\" concludes Dr. Katase.

  "text": "Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation reaction has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of its importance in solar energy conversion. For such a sluggish four-hole and four-proton transfer reaction in a long timescale of ms\u2013s, more and more studies have shown that the accumulation of multiple surface-trapped holes (e.g., high-valent iron oxo on hematite surfaces) or \"oxidizing equivalents\" is a prerequisite for efficient PEC water oxidation process. Previous PEC water oxidation studies commonly apply high potentials (>1.2 VRHE) to achieve this key. But how to complete multi-hole transfer under low bias (near the onset potential) remains unknown.       A study, published in  published in the journal Science China Chemistry and led by Prof. Yuchao Zhang (Key Laboratory of Photochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences), sought to address this topic.Zhang's research group studied the important role of excitation energy in the multi-hole accumulation process. PEC characterizations and rate law analysis showed that the UV excitation could significantly boost the accumulation of multiple surface-trapped holes, thereby cathodically shifting the onset potential by 220 mV and improving the PEC water oxidation activity by one order of magnitude.Subsequent bulk transport dynamics and surface charge-transfer kinetics demonstrated that compared with the visible-light excitation, the UV excitation reduced the formation probability of self-trapped excitons and resulted in ~3 to 5-fold increase of surface holes, which accounted for the promoted multi-hole accumulation process.These advantages enable the UV excitation to contribute about 40% to the total photocurrent under 1 solar illumination, even though its energy only occupies 6% of the incident light. This mechanism was also applicable to boost other multi-hole catalysis (such as the oxidation of thioether and nitrite) under low bias.

  "answer_squad": " molybdenum disulfide",
  "text": "Solar power technologies, which use solar cells to convert sunlight to electricity or storable fuels, are gaining momentum in a world looking beyond fossil fuels for its energy needs.          The dark bluish solar panels that dot rooftops and open fields today are typically made from silicon, a well-tested semiconductor material. Silicon photovoltaic technology has its limitations, though, losing up to 40% of the energy it collects from sunlight in the form of heat waste. Researchers at Colorado State University are studying radical new ways to improve solar power and provide more options for the industry to explore.CSU chemists are proposing to make solar cells using not silicon, but an abundantly available natural material called molybdenum disulfide. Using a creative combination of photoelectrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, the researchers conducted a series of experiments showing that extremely thin films of molybdenum disulfide display unprecedented charge carrier properties that could someday drastically improve solar technologies.The experiments were led by chemistry Ph.D. student Rachelle Austin and postdoctoral researcher Yusef Farah. Austin works jointly in the labs of Justin Sambur, associate professor in the Department of Chemistry, and Amber Krummel, associate professor in the same department. Farah is a former Ph.D. student in Krummel's lab. Their work is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The collaboration brought together Sambur's expertise in solar energy conversion using nanoscale materials, and Krummel's expertise in ultrafast laser spectroscopy, for understanding how different materials are structured and how they behave. Sambur's lab had become interested in molybdenum sulfide as a possible alternative solar material based on preliminary data on its light absorption capabilities even when only three atoms thick, explained Austin.That's when they turned to Krummel, whose lab contains a state-of-the-art ultrafast pump-probe transient absorption spectrometer that can very precisely measure the sequential energy states of individual electrons as they are excited with a laser pulse. Experiments using this special instrument can provide snapshots of how charges flow in a system. Austin created a photoelectrochemical cell using a single atomic layer of molybdenum sulfide, and she and Farah used the pump-probe laser to track the cooling of electrons as they moved through the material.What they found was astoundingly efficient light-to-energy conversion. More importantly, the laser spectroscopy experiments enabled them to show why this efficient conversion was possible.They found that the material was so good at converting light to energy because its crystal structure allows it to extract and exploit the energy of so-called hot carriers, which are highly energetic electrons that are briefly excited from their ground states when hit with enough visible light. Austin and Farah found that in their photoelectrochemical cell, the energy from these hot carriers was immediately converted into photocurrent, rather than lost as heat. This hot carrier extraction phenomenon is not present in conventional silicon solar cells.\"This work paves the way for knowing how to design reactors that contain these nanoscale materials for efficient and large-scale hydrogen production,\" Sambur said.The project was a collaboration with Professor Andr\u00e9s Montoya-Castillo and Dr. Thomas Sayer of University of Colorado Boulder, who contributed theoretical chemistry and computational modeling to help explain and verify the experimental data.\"The discovery required a 'team science' approach that brought together many different types of expertise, in computational, analytical and physical chemistry,\" Krummel said.

During metabolic process, microorganisms in food produce about 2,000 kinds of volatile metabolites with different chemical properties, including alcohols, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, acids, ketones, ethers, esters, etc.       The low concentration, variety, and large polar span of mVOCs lead to the difficulty of detection. Therefore, efficient sample pretreatment technology, highly sensitive analytical instruments and reliable data analysis methods are the key to the enrichment and detection of mVOCs.Researchers from the Wuhan Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have reviewed recent advances in mVOCs detection.

  "text": "The biomedical optics research team in Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), has developed a device for on-site immediate detection of pathogen nucleic acid. Their research results were published in Analytica Chimica Acta.          Microfluidic chips have been widely used in the nucleic acid detection of pathogens. The chips often use magnetic beads or silica gel films with high specific surface area to adsorb nucleic acid, but it may also lead to more residual fluid release agents and impurities. Therefore, microfluidic chips usually need to integrate multiple reagent storage tubes and perform fluid control in combination with microvalves and micropumps, to realize nucleic acid extraction and impurity cleaning. The complicated structure increases the complexity of the preparation process and supporting detection equipment of microfluidic chips.In this study, the researchers developed the mobile kit (Mkit) consisting of a chitosan-modified minimalistic microfluidic chip (CM3-chip) and smartphone, which realized the point-of-care testing of the nucleic acid of pathogens.The lumen wall of CM3-chip was modified with chitosan. Under acidic pH conditions, the primary amine in chitosan (pKa = 6.2 to 7.0) was positively charged. The Hofmeister effect showed that protonated amines were more likely to bond to negatively charged nucleic acids than other ions through the electrostatic interactions. CM3-chip could be directly amplified in situ after the enrichment of nucleic acid. Smartphones were used to control the whole process of detection, including temperature control, image acquisition, data processing and result analysis.Mkit has many advantages over traditional methods, including no centrifugation, no complex cleaning, no magnet attachment, and high sensitivity.A series of biological experiments showed that the detection equipment is universally applicable, selective, and user-friendly, and it can identify respiratory infectious agents with similar clinical symptoms. Artificially prepared saliva samples of H5N6 and IAV infections were also detected by Mkit.

  "text": "A viable formula for a carbon-negative, environmentally friendly concrete that is nearly as strong as regular concrete has been developed at Washington State University.          In a proof-of-concept work, the researchers infused regular cement with environmentally friendly biochar, a type of charcoal made from organic waste, that had been strengthened beforehand with concrete wastewater. The biochar was able to suck up to 23% of its weight in carbon dioxide from the air while still reaching a strength comparable to ordinary cement.The research could significantly reduce carbon emissions of the concrete industry, which is one of the most energy- and carbon-intensive of all manufacturing industries. The work, led by doctoral student Zhipeng Li, is reported in the journal, Materials Letters.\"We're very excited that this will contribute to the mission of zero-carbon built environment,\" said Xianming Shi, professor in the WSU Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the corresponding author on the paper.More than 4 billion tons of concrete are produced every year globally. Making ordinary cement requires high temperature and combustion of fuels. The limestone used in its production also goes through decomposition which produces carbon dioxide, so that cement production is thought to be responsible for about 8% of total carbon emissions by human activities worldwide.Researchers have tried adding biochar as a substitute in cement to make it more environmentally friendly and reduce its carbon footprint, but adding even 3% of biochar dramatically reduced the strength of the concrete. After treating biochar in the concrete washout wastewater, the WSU researchers were able to add up to 30% biochar to their cement mixture. The paste made of the biochar-amended cement was able to reach a compressive strength after 28 days comparable to that of ordinary cement of about 4,000 pounds per square inch.\"We're committed to finding novel ways to divert waste streams to beneficial uses in concrete; once we identify those waste streams, the next step is to see how we can wave the magic wand of chemistry and turn them into a resource,\" said Shi. \"The trick is really in the interfacial engineering\u2014how you engineer the interfaces in the concrete.\"The caustic concrete washout water is a sometimes problematic waste material from concrete production. The wastewater is very alkaline but also serves as a valuable source of calcium, said Shi. The researchers used the calcium to induce the formation of calcite, which benefits the biochar and eventually the concrete incorporating the biochar.\"Most other researchers were only able to add up to 3% biochar to replace cement, but we're demonstrating the use of much higher dosages of biochar because we've figured out how to engineer the surface of the biochar,\" he said.The synergy between the highly alkaline wastewater that contains a lot of calcium and the highly porous biochar meant that calcium carbonate precipitated onto or into the biochar, strengthening it and allowing for the capture of carbon dioxide from the air. A concrete made of the material would be expected to continue sequestering carbon dioxide for the lifetime of the concrete, typically 30 years in pavement or 75 years in a bridge.In order to commercialize this technology, the researchers have been working with the Office of Commercialization to protect the intellectual property and have filed a provisional patent application on their carbon-negative concrete work.

  "text": "Researchers have made huge strides in ensuring that red blood cell substitutes\u2014or artificial blood\u2014are able to work safely and effectively when transfused into the bloodstream.          The key is to make the artificial blood molecules big enough so they don't leak from blood vessels into tissue and cause dangerous cardiovascular side effects, notes a new study led by researchers from The Ohio State University.Although blood loss is typically treated by transfusing units of donated blood, in cases where transfusions aren't readily available or time is too limited to screen for patient blood type compatibility (such as in certain rural areas or on the battlefield), artificial blood products offer medical professionals more flexibility for treatment. In clinical trials, previous generations of these blood substitutes often resulted in several poor health outcomes, as individuals experienced symptoms ranging from narrowing of blood vessels and high blood pressure to tissue injury.In this study, researchers found that a certain sized fraction of red blood cell substitute can provide a range of health benefits, and can decrease the risk of cardiovascular side effects\u2014if its components are the right size.\"We found that as you make the red blood cell substitute molecules bigger, you have fewer side effects,\" said Alisyn Greenfield, lead author of the study and a Ph.D. student in chemical and biomolecular engineering at Ohio State. \"There's even a particular size range that has better benefits when it comes to the kind of cardiovascular effects that were seen with with previous generations of this material.\"Their findings were published in the journal Biomacromolecules.The researchers tested a red blood cell substitute called polymerized human hemoglobin\u2014PolyhHb. Although past commercial versions have been explored in clinical settings, they did not receive FDA approval due to their many side effects.To find a better solution, the team focused on identifying a target therapeutic size of PolyhHb by synthesizing material in four different-sized brackets and exploring the cardiovascular response in guinea pig models. Findings showed that the largest-sized brackets did not escape the blood vessels, or cause the blood vessels to narrow and elicit high blood pressure.Study senior author Andre Palmer, professor of chemical and biochemical engineering at Ohio State, said the antioxidant status of guinea pigs is more similar to humans than other rodents, making them a good model for the study.While these red blood cell substitutes aren't meant to replace blood entirely, this research highlights the potential of these materials. If transfused into a person soon after injury, they could be used to buy the person enough time to be transported to a medical facility to receive a blood transfusion, said Palmer.Additionally, because blood substitutes aren't made with any surface antigens or markers on the outside of the red blood cell's membrane, they can be transfused into anyone, regardless of their blood type. That said, artificial blood is still a long way from commercialization.Even though it can be stored at room temperature for several years compared to the 42-day storage period for donated blood, artificial blood doesn't come close to replicating the lifetime of real blood cells, said Palmer. Once produced, a typical red blood cell circulates in the human body for a period of about 120 days, yet the materials in current blood substitutes are made with only a half-life of about 24 hours after administration.Further study is needed to more accurately determine the red blood cell substitute's safety and efficacy in clinical settings. \"By performing this study, we demonstrated that we can improve upon what currently exists and, hopefully, be able to move our research forward and translate those materials into the clinic,\" said Greenfield.

  "text": "Bifunctional acid\u2212base catalysts are highly desirable for industrially relevant chemical processes. Owing to their ability to activate electrophiles and nucleophiles simultaneously, they allow the catalysis to proceed synergistically and cooperatively. Solid acid\u2212base catalysts are particularly advantageous since they are reusable and result in no waste products.          However, controlling the structure of such catalysts for cooperatively workable active sites is challenging. Simple and effective methods that enable the synthesis of high-performance solid acid\u2212base catalysts with desirable properties are thus required.A team of researchers led by Professor Keigo Kamata from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan have now proposed such a simple sol\u2013gel method for the synthesis of highly pure bifunctional solid acid\u2212base catalysts of perovskite-type oxides, advancing the frontiers of catalysis research. Their study was published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.Explaining the rationale for selecting perovskite-type oxides, Prof. Kamata says, \"Perovskite-type oxides are gaining importance in several fields, including magneticity, ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and catalysis. Moreover, the structure and physiochemical properties of perovskite-type oxides can be tuned by controlling their chemical composition.\"Perovskite-type oxides have a versatile composition and demonstrate good structural stability, flexibility, and controllability for several catalytic reactions. But they have not been sufficiently explored for acid\u2013base-catalyzed reactions. Moreover, the existing methods for synthesis are complex, time-consuming, and require multiple steps, making it difficult to synthesize highly pure and desirable perovskite oxide catalysts.The sol\u2013gel method developed by the team to circumvent these challenges has two key steps. The first involves preparing the precursor perovskite material, while the second comprises a calcination process to improve the surface area of the material.To prepare the precursor, the researchers dissolved a metal alkoxide containing either titanium (Ti4+), zirconium (Zr4+), or niobium (Nb5+) cations to a solution containing malic acid and hydrogen peroxide. They then added a metal acetate containing an A-site element to the solution and dried it to form a powdered precursor.Next, they subjected the precursor to a calcination process by heating it to 550\u00b0C in a nitrogen atmosphere and exposing it to air for 5 hours. The high temperature and the presence of oxygen crystallized the precursor and increased its surface area.Of the various catalysts synthesized using this method, the one with SrTiO3 nanoparticles (Sr: strontium) displayed the highest catalytic activity. It enabled efficient cyanosilylation of acetophenone with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) under mild reaction conditions without any thermal pretreatment.Upon examining the catalyst further, the team found its specific surface area (46 m2/g) to be 10 times higher than those of commercially available titanates (1\u20134 m2/g). Prof. Kamata adds, \"We observed that the synthesized nanoparticles could activate TMSCN on the basic oxygen site and the carbonyl compound on the acidic Ti site. This cooperative activation mechanism was responsible for the high catalytic activity of the catalyst for the cyanosilylation reaction.\"In summary, this straightforward method for synthesizing highly pure perovskite oxides for catalysis could become a promising strategy for enabling reactions requiring mild conditions.

  "text": "Self-assembled peptide supramolecular hydrogels have shown great application prospects in various areas, including tissue engineering, drug delivery, and biosensing.          Precisely and flexibly controlling the mechanical properties of peptide hydrogels to match the targeted applications is important. The common methods to regulate the mechanical properties of supramolecular hydrogels generally include: changing the formula (different peptide sequences, adding cross-linking agents) or changing the environmental conditions (concentration, temperature, pH and ions), both of which inevitably change the chemical composition of the hydrogel.Now, researchers from the Institute of Process Engineering (IPE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have explored strategies to control the mechanical properties of hydrogels by using the liquid\u2013liquid phase separation (LLPS)-mediated self-assembly principle without changing the chemical composition of hydrogels.The study was published in Matter.In the preparation of hydrogels, the number and size of phase-separated droplets are well-controlled in the early stage of self-assembly in order to tune the nanostructure of self-assembled precursors. These precursors can be urchin-like fibrils, beaded spindle-like fibrils, or radial fibril clusters.When it comes to further fibril growth and formation of a non-covalent cross-linking network, the structural difference between precursors leads to a difference in fibril diameter, number of fibrils, and cross-linking density of the network, thus forming hydrogel materials with different mechanical strength and recoverability.The researchers found that tuning incubation temperature and time through process sequencing could control the self-assembled precursors. An optimal initial incubation temperature could lead to optimal mechanical strength and recoverability when the chemical composition of the hydrogel remained unchanged. The optimal initial temperature was precisely the temperature at which the droplets were transformed into nanofibrils.They further confirmed through experiments and molecular simulation that at the phase transition temperature, peptide molecules showed a strong aggregation propensity, de-solvation effect, and dynamic metastable hydrogen bonding, which was conducive to fibril branching, thus enabling the hydrogel to obtain the best nanofibril strength and cross-linking density under the condition of constant concentration.

  "text": "Doping a liquid crystal with azobenzene molecules can induce reversible changes in its thermal conductivity under light irradiation. These findings have been reported in a new collaboration between the Center for Research in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Materials (CiQUS) groups and is now featured on the cover of the Journal of Materials Chemistry C.       Current challenges in this topic such as thermal dissipation in microelectronics, necessary to prevent devices from overheating, can be addressed by designing new functional materials with tunable thermal conductivity. Liquid crystals are a very interesting family of materials, with appealing applications such as LCD screens.The new study shows that azobenzene molecules can be used to control the thermal conductivity of liquid crystals using ultraviolet light.\"Azobenzenes are a class of molecules whose structure changes with light, so that when added into a liquid crystal, the transport of heat through the whole system can be modified by irradiating it with ultraviolet light,\" says Noa Varela, Ph.D. student at CiQUS and first author of the study. \"Depending on the molecular arrangement of the liquid crystal, either a increase or decrease of the thermal conductivity can be achieved upon illumination, at room temperature.\"Given the huge variety of available liquid crystals, the work arisen from the synergy between F.

  "text": "Conventional transportation equipment relies heavily on steel. But steel is heavy, and scientists are turning to alternatives in the quest to improve the safety and speed of transportation, while simultaneously lessening its environmental footprint.          Magnesium alloys, with their low density and excellent strength-to-weight ratio, are considered the next-generation base metal for multi-material design and have been touted as a possible replacement for conventional steels when appropriate.Although progress has been made in overcoming certain weaknesses associated with magnesium alloys, such as flammability, developing bonding technology that bonds magnesium alloys with structural steels has been severely limited because magnesium and iron are immiscible and do not form at the alloy phase.Yet, a research group from Tohoku University has succeeded in establishing a dealloying bonding technology that obtains a strong mechanical bond between iron and magnesium. The findings are published in the journal Scripta Materialia.\"Our dealloying reaction derives from the miscibility and immiscibility of the constituent elements in the bond, and also helped create a three-dimensional, interlocked microstructure at the interface of the two materials,\" said Kota Kurabayashi, a master's student at the Graduate School of Engineering, who co-authored the study along with Professor Hidemi Kato and Associate Professor Takeshi Wada from the Institute for Materials Research.Kato also points out that this approach provides an ideal mechanical bonding method that creates a strong anchoring effect between materials that cannot form strong bonds.Looking ahead, the research group plans to harness the advance dealloying technique to bond immiscible dissimilar materials and produce new light-weight materials that reduce the fuel consumption of automobiles, trains, and airplanes.

  "answer_squad": " AtomAI",
  "text": "Researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a machine-learning inspired software package that provides end-to-end image analysis of electron and scanning probe microscopy images.          Known as AtomAI, the package applies deep learning to microscopy data at atomic resolutions, thereby providing quantifiable physical information such as the precise position and type of each atom in a sample.Using these methods, researchers can quickly derive statistically meaningful information from immensely complex datasets. These datasets routinely include hundreds of images that each contain thousands of atoms and abnormalities in molecular structure. This improvement to data analysis allows researchers to engineer quantum atomically precise abnormalities in materials, and can be used to gain deeper insights into the materials' physical and chemical qualities.Electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy allow materials scientists, physicists and other researchers to probe atomic and molecular structures at extremely high resolutions. These high-resolution methods allow researchers to clearly observe atomic structures, making them an important tool in understanding and engineering materials at the nanoscale.Electron microscopy is useful for gaining precise information on the structure of a material, whereas scanning probe microscopy is more often used to learn about a material's functional properties, such as superconductivity or magnetism. Both methods benefit from modern image analysis methods.Deep learning is a kind of machine learning that allows a program to train itself to accurately identify the contents of an image or block of text. When traditional machine learning is applied to image analysis, relevant features are manually extracted from a set of images\u2014a process known as feature engineering\u2014and used to create a model that categorizes objects based on those features.In contrast, deep learning models automatically learn relevant features by using a network of layered \"neurons\"\u2014biologically-inspired nodes through which data and computations flow\u2014trained to detect various aspects of an image at different levels of complexity. This allows for increased precision and the analysis of more diverse information when compared with traditional machine learning, so long as enough data exists to train the system.      AtomAI, which was developed partially at ORNL's Center for Nanophase Materials Science, includes a unique model architecture to identify thin objects such as nanofibers or domain walls\u2014the interfaces separating magnetic domains\u2014in microscopy data. The software package is also built to reduce errors in image processing by accounting for unintended changes in the image data, such as incoming cosmic rays or images of non-target materials, and by incorporating certain unchanging physical characteristics into the model.Also, AtomAI includes tools that allow researchers to conduct real-time analysis of the data being gathered and to import information directly into theoretical simulations. These features are useful for gaining insights into the energetics and optical, electronic and magnetic properties of the physical structures being observed.An overview of the software package was published in Nature Machine Intelligence.\"People used to treat microscopy as a purely qualitative tool,\" said Maxim Ziatdinov, a researcher at ORNL and the lead developer of AtomAI, \"but recently there was sort of a shift in the mindset of the community: Microscopy can actually be used to extract quantitative physical information.\" Qualitative microscopy methods generally rely on researchers noting holistic information about a sample, while the new quantitative methods allow for precise numerical representations of a material's structure or properties.Software such as AtomAI has enabled this shift, providing a method to quantitatively analyze the structures of whole samples to find meaningful data that qualitative methods might misrepresent or simply not notice.Ziatdinov expects his team's work to accelerate the rate of progress in both fundamental and applied materials research. \"If you can characterize things faster and automate at least some parts of the process, then you will also speed up all aspects of materials science research,\" he said.AtomAI was designed with ease of use and access in mind. The entire package can be launched from a browser and requires minimal coding knowledge to operate.\"If you're an experimentalist, then you should be able to use machine learning without knowing all the math behind the process and without necessarily being a good coder,\" Ziatdinov said.AtomAI is a complete software package, and Ziatdinov and his team expect to expand its capabilities and support more features. He is particularly interested in adding functionality for theoretical researchers looking for accurate estimates of structures' physical characteristics, such as energetics and stability, without going through the time-consuming and expensive process of traditional simulations.Ziatdinov is also looking forward to hearing directly from other researchers about their needs and ideas for AtomAI and is working with them to integrate new features into the software package.

The test, described in a new paper in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition, could improve food safety, reduce the cost of processing fresh poultry and other foods, and help to limit broad recalls to batches that have specifically been identified as contaminated.The researchers have shown that the test provides accurate results in an hour or less without the need for accessories or a power source, compared to today's monitoring through lab cultures, which require at least a full day to produce results.Once scaled up and made available commercially, the new test could be a significant boon to poultry processors, for whom Salmonella is among the most significant contamination risks. The test would also be beneficial for ensuring the safe processing of other foods that are particularly vulnerable to Salmonella, such as eggs, dairy products and ground beef.A single major poultry processor performs tens of thousands of Salmonella lab tests each year. Reducing or even eliminating the need for overnight lab cultures would represent significant savings and make it easier to identify contamination earlier in the process.McMaster University researchers demonstrate and explain their new lab-free test for Salmonella contamination.

If it's cheap, reliable and easy, why not use it?\"Protecting the public from Salmonella is a high priority for food producers, retailers and regulators alike, since Salmonella is one of the most common and serious forms of food-borne infection, causing 155,000 deaths globally every year.What makes the test work is a new synthetic nucleic acid molecule, developed at McMaster. For the test, the molecule is sandwiched between microscopic particles such as gold.The test platform lines the inside of the tip of a pipette and begins to work when a liquefied sample of the food being tested is drawn inside the tube.      If Salmonella bacteria are present, they cut through the particles, allowing the molecule to escape.

  "answer_squad": " one that has been accepted for more than five decades",
  "text": "The process of reverse osmosis has proven to be the state-of-the-art method for removing salt from seawater and increasing access to clean water. Other applications include wastewater treatment and energy production.          Now a team of researchers reveal in a new study that the standard explanation for how reverse osmosis works\u2014one that has been accepted for more than five decades\u2014is fundamentally wrong. In the process, the researchers offer an alternate theory. Besides correcting the record, these insights could lead to more effective uses of reverse osmosis. The results of the study, led by the lab of Prof. Menachem Elimelech, are published in Science Advances.Reverse osmosis\u2014a technology first put to use in the 1960s\u2014removes salt and impurities from water by passing the water through a semipermeable membrane, which allows the water to go through while blocking the contaminants. To explain exactly how it works, researchers have used the theory of solution-diffusion. This theory assumes that the water molecules dissolve and diffuse through the membrane by way of their concentration gradient\u2014that is, the molecules move from areas of high concentration to wherever there are fewer molecules. Although this theory has been widely accepted for more than 50 years and is even taught in textbooks, Elimelech said he has long had questions about it.\"Some of the assumptions do not make any sense,\" said Elimelech, the Sterling Professor of Chemical and Environmental Engineering. For instance, he said, the theory is based in part on the idea that pressure across the membrane is constant. \"Whenever you have water flow through any porous material, there is always a pressure drop.\"To get a better sense of the physics involved, the research team\u2014which included scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Texas Tech University\u2014did a combination of experiments and computer simulations. Specifically, they used simulations of the molecules' movements, which revealed that water transport is driven by changes in pressure within the membranes. They further show that water molecules travel as clusters through a network of pores in the membrane. This contrasts with the conventional theory based on the solution-diffusion model, which assumes that the water molecules separate from each other in the membranes.Supplementing the computer simulations, the scientists performed experiments that allowed them to observe water passing through membranes. The results showed that the way that water permeates the membrane depends on the membrane pore size, the size of the water molecules, and viscosity of the water. This was also inconsistent with the solution-diffusion model.Overall, the simulations and experiments demonstrated that, rather than being driven by the concentration of molecules, reverse osmosis is driven by pressure changes within the membrane.Because previous measurements related to reverse osmosis were based on a faulty understanding of it on a molecular level, Elimelech said, many attempts to advance the field have met a dead end. Having a more accurate theory to explain reverse osmosis, he said, could open the way toward developing more effective materials and techniques to improve the process.

In South Australia, there are plans to open the world's largest hydrogen power plant near Whyalla, as part of an expansive Hydrogen Jobs Plan, which underlines the timeliness of the latest research by Flinders University, University of Adelaide and Tokyo University of Science experts.\"It's an exciting time to be involved in hydrogen science, and there are rapid advances being made to ensure the greatest possible efficiency of hydrogen production,\" says Flinders Professor of Chemical Physics Gunther Andersson, first author in a new article outlining the method in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising technique to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using semiconductor particles as photocatalysts. While researchers understand that the structural and electronic properties of photocatalyst semiconductors play a major role in determining photocatalytic activity, their goal is to find the best and most efficient material to assist this process\u2014which they have found to be chromium oxide.\"Cocatalysts can promote efficient photocatalytic water splitting by supporting the electron and hold separation and acts as active sites for the water splitting reaction,\" says Professor Andersson, who is Deputy Director of the Flinders University Institute for NanoScale Science and Technology at the College of Science and Engineering.\"However, the cocatalyst requires a protective overlayer to suppress the H2 and O2 recombination which will result in a backward reaction that takes H2 and O2 back to H2O.\"We need to find the right overlayer material to ensure the most efficient photocatalytic water splitting\u2014and this led us to explore mixed transition metal oxides.\"The researchers found that chromium oxide overlayers protect the water splitting process in photocatalysis for solar light driven hydrogen production.Their work investigated the stability, oxidation state and the bulk and surface electronic structure of chromium-oxide photodeposited onto different particles as a function of the annealing process.Importantly, the international research team also found that the chromium oxide overlayers do not contribute to the water splitting reaction.Senior co-author University of Adelaide Professor of Chemistry Gregory Metha adds, \"World-leading photocatalysts have chromium oxide overlayers and this work reveals new insights into the nature of the coating that could lead to improvements in future materials.\"It is known that chromium oxide overlayers protect the water splitting process in photocatalysis for solar light driven hydrogen production.

  "text": "A key ingredient in the manufacture of car tires and sneaker soles could be made sustainably, following new analysis of an old catalytic process. Butadiene, an essential component of synthetic rubber, is currently produced by the petrochemical industry from fossil reserves.          But it could be efficiently made in a one-step reaction from renewable ethanol using a modernized version of an unusual old catalyst. \"Butadiene is currently produced as a byproduct of the petrochemical industry, which can lead to shortages in its supply,\" explains Sang-Ho Chung, a research scientist in the labs of Javier Ruiz-Martinez, with whom he co-led the work. \"Also, these routes are clearly not sustainable,\" he adds.These challenges in butadiene production have sparked renewed interest in the Lebedev process, first developed in the 1930s, that converts ethanol to butadiene in a single catalytic reactor. \"Sustainable butadiene could be made by using bioethanol in the Lebedev process or even ethanol made using cutting-edge CO -to-ethanol processes,\" Chung says.The Lebedev process is driven by silica-magnesia catalysts that are produced by an unusual method called wet kneading. The method involves combining solid catalyst precursors in water under continuous mixing.\"Wet kneading is quite uncommon in catalyst preparation, but it is often applied to prepare high-performance silicamagnesia catalysts for the Lebedev process,\" Ruiz-Martinez says.Find out how KAUST researchers are developing sustainable catalysts. Credit: 2023 KAUSTHowever, improved wet-kneaded catalysts have mainly been discovered by trial and error. Why some catalysts outperform others is not fully understood, and \"understanding how these materials form is the first step to preparing better catalysts,\" Ruiz-Martinez says.Chung, Ruiz-Martinez and their KAUST colleagues used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study silica-magnesia catalyst formation under real wet kneading conditions. \"We found that two different catalyst particles are formed, based on the cross-deposition of silicon species onto magnesia and magnesium species onto silica,\" Chung says. The findings are published in the journal Nature Catalysis.Crucially, they showed that magnesium silicates on the silica particles tend to produce ethylene as an undesired side product. \"With that understanding, we could synthesize just the catalyst particles that are active for butadiene production and avoid the particles that produce ethylene,\" Chung says.The team also showed that the best catalysts also had certain active sites in very close proximity. \"This has helped us to work on the next generation of catalysts for this process,\" RuizMartinez says. \"We are making good progress and already have an even more selective version, which could be a key step for commercializing the process.\" More information:Sang-Ho Chung, Origin of active sites on silica\u2013magnesia catalysts and control of reactive environment in the one-step ethanol-to-butadiene process, Nature Catalysis (2023).

  "text": "A team of chemists affiliated with several institutions in Germany has found that using a ball mill can speed up sublimation needed for testing gas interactions. In their study, reported in the journal Chem, the group tested the use of a ball mill to see how it would impact sublimation.          A ball mill is a device with a spherical chamber into which heavy balls made of steel or other materials are placed. The chamber is connected to other parts that turn the chamber. When other materials are placed into the chamber with the balls and the chamber is turned, the balls are pulled up the walls of the chamber until gravity takes over, at which point they fall, crushing the other material.In this way, as the chamber continues to spin, the secondary material can be crushed to produce a powder. In this new effort, the team looked to use the ball mill in a new way\u2014to speed up sublimation, in which a material changes from a solid to a gas without first becoming a liquid. There are occasions when chemists wish to sublimate a material to a gas and then combine that gas with another gas to form a new material or to incite a reaction. Unfortunately, the process of sublimation is generally pretty slow, so the team wanted to test the idea of using a ball mill.In their work, the researchers added new components to the spherical chamber\u2014inlets and exits for the gas. In their work, that meant argon and nitrogen. This allowed a steady stream of new gas to be injected into the chamber as gas was being sublimated from test materials as the chamber was spun. The mix of gases could then be continually vented from the exit valve to a secondary chamber where it could be tested using NMR spectroscopy.Testing of several materials showed that the process worked as hoped\u2014using the ball mill increased the rate of sublimation for all those tested, though to differing degrees, allowing for a constant stream of mixed gas to exit the chamber, ready for use in a desired application.

Published April 14 in npj Materials Degradation, two common strains of fungi were used to successfully biodegrade polypropylene in a laboratory experiment.Typically found in soil and plants, Aspergillus terreus and Engyodontium album were able to break down polypropylene after it had been pre-treated with either UV light or heat, reducing the plastic by 21% over 30 days of incubation, and by 25%\u201327% over 90 days.\"Polypropylene is a common plastic used to make a huge variety of everyday products like food containers, coat hangers and cling film, but it only has a recycling rate of only one percent, meaning it is overrepresented in plastic waste and pollution globally,\" said the study's lead author from the University of Sydney's School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Ph.D. student Amira Farzana Samat.The researchers hope their method could one day reduce the vast amount of plastic polluting the environment and lead to a greater understanding of how plastic pollution might biodegrade naturally under certain conditions.\"Plastic pollution is by far one of the biggest waste issues of our time. The vast majority of it isn't adequately recycled, which means it often ends up in our oceans, rivers and in landfill. It's been estimated that 109 million tons of plastic pollution have accumulated in the world's rivers and 30 million tons now sit in the world's oceans\u2014with sources estimating this will soon surpass the total mass of fish,\" said Samat.                Engyodontium album. Credit: Amira Samat             The researchers say polypropylene is so infrequently recycled because of its short life as a packaging material and because it often becomes contaminated by other materials and plastics, necessitating new recycling methods that have minimal environmental impact.Samat's Ph.D. supervisor, Professor Ali Abbas from the School of Chemical and Molecular Engineering and Chief Circular Engineer at Circular Australia said, \"Despite the massive scale of plastic production and consumption, there has been very little attention paid to plastics degradation under environmental conditions, and our understanding of how plastics can be degraded is limited.\"\"One big question our result has raised is\u2014what are the naturally occurring conditions which can fast track the degradation of plastics? We seek to further explore the role of biological processes offered by fungi and other microorganisms.\"Professor Dee Carter, an expert in mycology (the study of fungi) in the School of Life and Environmental Sciences and co-author of the study said, \"Fungi are incredibly versatile and are known to be able to break down pretty much all substrates. This superpower is due to their production of powerful enzymes, which are excreted and used to break down substrates into simpler molecules that the fungal cells can then absorb.\"\"Often, these fungi have evolved to break down woody materials, but this ability can be repurposed to attack other substrates. This is why we find fungi growing on all sorts of man-made materials like carpets, painted furniture, tile grout, shower curtains, upholstery and even car headlights.\"Recent studies suggest some fungi may even degrade some of the 'forever chemicals' like PFAS, but the process is slow and not yet well understood. There is also evidence that the amount of plastic accumulated in the ocean is less than what might be expected based on production and disposal levels, and there is speculation that some of this 'missing' plastic may have been degraded by marine fungi.\"                How the experiment worked to biodegrade polypropylene. Credit: University of Sydney             How the process workedPolypropylene in various forms was initially treated with one of three separate methods: ultraviolet light, heat, and Fenton's reagent\u2014an acidic solution of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron often used to oxidize contaminants.In a petri dish, the fungi were applied separately as single cultures to treated polypropylene. The validity of the biodeterioration was then confirmed through microscopy techniques. While the research didn't evaluate how the plastic was degraded by the fungi or whether it was metabolized, the researchers hope to conduct further research to determine the type of bio-chemical processes taking place.Next stepsProfessor Abbas believes the low rate of plastics recycling globally presents a \"massive plastics circularity gap\": \"We need to support the development of disruptive recycling technologies that improve the circularity of plastics, especially those technologies that are driven by biological processes like in our study. It is important to note that our study did not yet carry out any optimization of the experimental conditions, so there is plenty of room to further reduce this degradation time.\"The researchers will now explore enhancing the overall efficiency in degrading polypropylene before seeking investment to scale the technology and develop a small-scale pilot prototype for commercialization.Since completing the study, the team has isolated other microorganisms from the marine environment and used a similar process to degrade marine plastic waste, with preliminary results showing even higher degradation.Samat said, \"We are quite excited about this and have started looking at different ways to improve the degradation process using these microorganisms. Watch this space.\" More information:Amira Farzana Samat et al, Biodeterioration of pre-treated polypropylene by Aspergillus terreus and Engyodontium album, npj Materials Degradation (2023).

  "text": "While the wheel does not need to be reinvented, there are benefits to the development of new nano-wheels, according to a multi-institute research team based in China. The group fabricated a novel family of metallic compounds, each of which exhibit unique properties desirable for next-generation technologies, such as advanced sensors.          Their findings were made available in Polyoxometalates.\"Polymetallic complexes are of great interest not only for their appealing molecular structure but also for their versatile applications in various fields,\" said co-corresponding author Yan-Zhen Zheng, professor in the Frontier Institute of Science and Technology (FIST) at Xi'an Jiaotong University.Polymetallic complexes, which comprise multiple atoms of various metals or a combination of metals and other elements, have the potential to imbue materials with specific properties if the molecules can be synthesized, Zheng said. Such properties include the ability to fluoresce, or glow, and magnetic quirks that allow drastic temperature changes and control.Zheng and his team focused on creating polymetallic complexes made with lanthanide elements, a group of 15 metallic materials also known as rare earth elements. They specifically used europium, terbium and gadolinium.\"Among all polymetallic complexes, lanthanide-based compounds have drawn unprecedented attention due to their interesting magnetic and luminescence behaviors,\" Zheng said. \"Several such compounds have been successfully isolated, but direct synthesis has been a challenge.\"The components of the complexes require are geometrically diverse, requiring significant coordination, according to Zheng.\"Previous findings revealed that controlling the hydrolysis\u2014breaking down a compound with water\u2014of lanthanide metal ions in the presence of appropriate organic ligands would be a powerful strategy to obtain desired species,\" Zheng said. A ligand is a molecule that bonds to a metal atom. Its addition to the complex can stabilize the structure.The researchers used hydrolysis to breakdown lanthanides in a bath containing a ligand called tricine. Tricine contains multiple arms of oxygen and hydrogen, meaning it can accommodate a large range of metals and help stabilize the resulting clusters.\"Through the simple hydrolysis reaction, we synthesized three lanthanide nano-clusters, and used X-ray diffraction analyses to reveal their stable, wheel-like structure,\" Zheng said. \"Owing to the presence of different lanthanide metal ions in these analogues, each compound shows distinctive properties.\"The europium-based cluster fluoresced red emissions, while the terbium-based cluster fluoresced green emissions. The gadolinium-based cluster exhibited potential applications in magnetic cooling. According to Zheng, the research group is continuing to investigate the synthesis and application of these clusters.

  "text": "Junior Associate Professor Kazuo Takayama and his research team used human airway organoids to screen autophagy-related compounds and found cycloheximide and thapsigargin to show strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2. Further testing revealed cycloheximide to be also effective against six SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains and other human coronaviruses. Results of this study were published online in Molecular Pharmaceutics on March 22, 2023.          Targeting host proteins involved in viral infections is an effective approach for dealing with viruses that mutate rapidly to produce new strains one after another. In this study, the scientists attempted to find COVID-19 therapeutic agents by focusing on autophagy. Autophagy is known to be closely involved with infection by SARS-CoV-2 and its elimination, thus making autophagy-related compounds potential COVID-19 therapeutic candidates.The research team screened a library of autophagy-related compounds with airway organoids to identify compounds that could control SARS-CoV-2 infection. From the 80 compounds tested, they found cycloheximide and thapsigargin to reduce infection efficiency in a dose-dependent manner.Because cycloheximide showed greater antiviral efficacy than thapsigargin, they further examined cycloheximide in detail. Cycloheximide also exhibited antiviral activity against six SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains, as well as against human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which suggests that cycloheximide has broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity. On the other hand, the researchers observed significant toxicity caused by cycloheximide in animal experiments due to its function as a protein synthesis inhibitor.Takayama believes less toxic derivatives or analogous compounds of cycloheximide that retain their antiviral effects hold great promise if developed in the future. In this study, the team demonstrated the feasibility of drug screening using human airway organoids, thus hinting at the possibility of combining the method with much larger compound libraries for more extensive COVID-19 therapeutic drug discovery.

  "text": "Discrete metal\u2013organic cages (MOCs) with unique cavities have attracted considerable research attention. Their accessible hydrophobic inner spaces can absorb and orient guest molecules by means of supermolecular interactions, making them broadly applicable to molecular encapsulation, among other applications.          The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analyses are commonly used to investigate the host\u2013guest interactions between the host MOC and adsorbed guest species. However, studying how the host\u2013guest complexes behave at molecular level remains a challenge, because high-quality single crystals of host MOC are required to realize guest exchange and structure analysis using conventional X-ray diffraction methods.In a study published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition, the research group led by Prof. Zhang Jian from Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, reported the post-assembly modification of homochiral titanium\u2013organic cages for recognition and separation of molecular isomers.The researchers extended and fixed the pre-synthesized chiral MOC into a porous framework, improving its crystal stability in the solid state and enabling the study of host guest behavior at the molecular level.By employing the chiral MOC as a precursor, the researchers synthesized a pair of size-tunable and homochiral Ti4L6 cage-based frameworks polynuclear titanium cage (PTC)-236(\u0394 and \u039b) using a post-assembly reaction. They constructed the three-dimensional microporous framework of PTC-236 by using \u0394\u0394\u0394\u0394- or \u039b\u039b\u039b\u039b-[Ti4L6] cages with triple-stranded left- or right-handed helical Zn-bimb chains (bimb = 4,4'-di(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl).The researchers found that PTC-236 was highly stable in air, water, and other solvents, and possessed chiral pore channels in its host framework and rich recognition sites provided by the cage moieties. These characteristics facilitated the study of PTC-236 in host\u2013guest chemistry via single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. They utilized PTC-236 for the X-ray diffraction analyses of more than 20 guests, including benzene (PhH) and its derivatives, aromatic/aliphatic nitriles, and aromatic alcohol molecules.The researchers also revealed that the material exhibited selective recognition and separation ability for spice Cinnamonitrile cis-trans isomers with up to 95% separation. They can clearly observe the host-guest interactions between the titanium cage and captured guests.This study provides a new strategy for the orderly combination of structurally well-defined MOCs into functional porous frameworks, expands the use of MOCs in solid phases, and develops a novel controlled multistage assembly system for isomer separation materials.

  "text": "A team of chemists from Aix-Marseille University, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay and Institut Polytechnique de Paris has discovered that the chlorella variabilis fatty acid photodecarboxylase (CvFAP) can be used to convert octanoic acids four times faster than hexadecanoic acids.          In their study, reported in the journal Science Advances, the group tested fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) and discovered a process to convert an 8-carbon fatty acid to a liquid hydrocarbon much faster than prior processes. Also, the editors at Nature have published a Research Highlights article outlining the work done by the team on this new effort.As climate change progresses, scientists around the world continue to look for ways to stop or reduce carbon emissions. One of the main areas of focus is the huge amounts of CO2 emitted by automobiles. Scientists would like to find a replacement for the fossil fuels with fuels that do not emit carbon dioxide. One possibility is the use of natural processes that can convert natural ingredients into cleaner fuel, such as algae conversion of fatty acids found in fats and oils into hydrocarbons.Such processes are driven by FAP, which is powered through sunlight conversion. Unfortunately, research efforts have been unsuccessful at producing large amounts of hydrocarbons that can be used as a fuel because the process typically involves deriving fatty acids that have long chains of carbon atoms. In this new effort, the research team found an autocatalytic effect that dramatically boosts the production of short carbon-atom chained hydrocarbons.In their work, the researchers tested the use of FAP in solutions containing 8-carbon atom chains of fatty acids. They found that when exposed to light, the enzyme chlorella variabilis was able to convert such chains to a liquid hydrocarbon up to four times as fast as those using 16-atom chains\u2014possibly opening the door to using CvFAP as a way to mass produce and sell a much greener type of hydrocarbon fuel.

In their study, reported in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science, the group analyzed air samples inside the vehicle over multiple days.          Cars, trucks and SUVs all have one thing in common: When purchased brand-new, they come with what has come to be known as that \"new car smell.\" That smell is made up of chemicals released into the air by materials used to make cars\u2014a process known as off-gassing. Prior research has suggested that some of those chemicals, such as formaldehyde, may pose a health hazard for new car drivers. In this new effort, the research team took a more serious look at the chemicals released into the air by just one vehicle\u2014a brand-new, midsize, plug-in hybrid SUV that was manufactured within one month of testing.The team parked the SUV in a local outdoor parking lot and tested the air inside of it every day for 12 consecutive days. They note that over the course of their study, environmental conditions changed, most noticeably, air temperature\u2014from 21\u00b0C to 63\u00b0C. They used gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy to identify chemicals in air sample and their concentrations.The researchers identified 20 chemicals in the air samples that had come from components used to make the vehicle. They amounts varied depending mostly on surface temperatures inside the car (not air temperatures). They found that the amounts of some chemicals, such as formaldehyde, exceeded Chinese government safety standards at some points by up to 35%. Acetaldehyde, a known carcinogen, exceeded standards by 61%. The team also found levels of benzene that they described as being unsafe for drivers breathing it for long drives.

  "text": "Thinking of CO2, terms like climate-damaging or waste product probably quickly come to mind. While CO2 has been that for a long time\u2014a pure waste product\u2014more and more processes are being developed with which the greenhouse gas can be converted into valuable raw materials. Researchers then speak of \"value-added chemicals.\" A new material that makes this possible was developed at TU Wien and recently presented in the journal Communications Chemistry.          Researchers at Prof. Dominik Eder's group developed a new material that facilitates the conversion of CO2. These are MOCHAs\u2014organometallic chalcogenolate compounds that serve as catalysts. The result of the electrochemical conversion is synthesis gas, or syngas for short, which is an important raw material for the chemical industry.CO2 becomes synthesis gasSyngas is a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2) and other gases and is used as a basic material for other substances. One of the most important fields of application is fertilizer production, in which ammonia is produced from syngas. However, it can also be used for the production of fuels such as diesel or for the production of methanol, which is used in fuel cells. Since the extraction of CO2 from the atmosphere is quite energy-intensive, taking CO2 from industrial plants is a good option. From there, it can serve as a starting material for various chemicals.However, previous methods require high temperatures and pressures as well as expensive catalysts. Therefore, the Viennese researchers were looking for catalysts that can also be used to produce syngas at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure.\"MOCHAs work differently than the catalysts used so far: Instead of heat, electricity is supplied to activate the catalyst and trigger the conversion of CO2 into synthesis gas,\" explains Junior Group Leader Dogukan Apaydin, who is responsible for research efforts towards CO2 conversion in the research group.MOCHAs as problem solversMOCHAs are a material class that was developed almost 20 years ago but has not yet found any application. The organic-inorganic hybrid materials have gained popularity again in recent years. The TU researchers recognized the potential of MOCHAs as catalysts and conducted experiments with them for the first time. However, they encountered some problems: Previous synthesis methods only yielded small amounts of product and required a lot of time. \"With the help of our synthesis method, we were able to significantly increase the amount of product and reduce the time from 72 to five hours,\" Apaydin explains.Initial tests showed that the catalytic performance of MOCHAs in the production of synthesis gas from CO2 is comparable to previously established catalysts. Moreover, they require much less energy, as the entire reaction can be carried out at room temperature. In addition, MOCHAs prove to be extremely stable. They can be used in different solvents, at different temperatures or under different pH conditions and retain their structure even after catalysis.Nevertheless, there are some parameters that the team around Dogukan Apaydin and Ph.D. student Hannah Rabl continue to research. If the same electrodes are used several times to supply energy in the form of power, there is a slight drop in performance. How the connection between MOCHAs and electrodes can be further improved to prevent this drop in performance is now being researched in long-term experiments.\"We are still at an early stage of application,\" Dogukan Apaydin admits. \"I like to compare this with solar panels, which were much more complex and expensive to produce 30 years ago than today. But with the right infrastructure and political will, MOCHAs can also be widely used in the future to convert CO2 into synthesis gas and thus make their contribution to climate protection.\" More information:Hannah Rabl et al, Microwave-assisted synthesis of metal-organic chalcogenolate assemblies as electrocatalysts for syngas production, Communications Chemistry (2023).

  "answer_race": " Ice quenching for metal",
  "question_squad": " What is the scientific term for levitation?",
  "answer_squad": " burnout",
  "text": "Associate Professor Jonathan Boreyko leads a team at Virginia Tech that has built a strong portfolio of work with ice and water, exploring the possibilities for de-icing planes, building novel water harvesting devices, and creating snow globes out of bubbles. This familiarity with water has given the team a strong sense of its behavior in different states, leading to a new project that shows how ice quenches heat in comparison to water. The findings were published in the journal Chem on April 14.          Mojtaba Edalatpour and master's student Camryn Col\u00f3n carried out this project. They investigated methods of quenching heat from metal, a critical step in applications such as metallurgy and firefighting. Both instances require speed. Metallurgists need to rapidly drop the temperature of a forged piece to achieve specific material properties, while firefighters work to stop destruction of property as quickly as possible. Quenching with water is only effective beneath a critical temperature\u2014any higher and the water levitates on its own vapor and can no longer boil the heat away.Boreyko's team wanted to see if using ice, rather than water, could bypass the levitation issue to enable the quenching of ultra-hot surfaces.Measuring, heating, and measuring againTo conduct this research, Edalatpour and Col\u00f3n heated an aluminum stage and measured the cooling rate of water versus ice. To ensure a direct comparison, they released the same amount of water and ice onto the surface after it was heated to a desired temperature.When the initial surface temperature of the stage was between 100\u00b0C and 300\u00b0C, both the water and the ice successfully quenched the surface below 100\u00b0C. The ice, however, achieved that result in half the time. At higher initial temperatures\u2014300\u00b0C to 500\u00b0C\u2014only quenching with ice was successful. Heat transfer with ice was more than 100 times more effective than with liquid water at these high temperatures.What was the difference? The properties of water prevent it from hitting the sweet spot for removing heat.That sweet spot is boiling, because the steam escaping in bubbles most efficiently carries the heat away. Because water easily levitates on its vapor at high temperatures, it becomes insulated from the surface and the boiling never occurs. Ice behaves differently. When dropped onto a hot surface, ice absorbs much of the heat as it melts. This reduces the amount of heat available for producing vapor bubbles, preventing the levitation problem. In other words, the meltwater boils at a slower pace compared to pure water, thus helping to maintain boiling at high temperatures.Boreyko compared the unusual liquid behavior with worker productivity.\"Think about a workaholic who is always focusing on their job,\" he said. \"They start off hyper-productive but quickly burn out and become ineffective. It turns out that water is the same way when exposed to ultra-high temperature surfaces: It is so focused and productive at boiling water into vapor that it experiences 'burnout,' which is the scientific term for levitation and the catastrophic failure in cooling that results. So ice is like the slow and steady tortoise that wins in the long run. It doesn't make vapor bubbles very well, but this allows it to keep boiling and avoid levitation when things get heated.\"      The frozen path continuesThe group's hypothesis of using ice for quenching followed its recent discovery that ice does not levitate and lose its boiling capability until 550\u00b0C, compared to 150\u00b0C for water. Based on those findings, Boreyko's team began several new projects applying its principles. This heat transfer is the first outgrowth to be published.Col\u00f3n's follow-up work includes measuring the cooling performance of ice when the surface is fixed at a constant temperature rather than being allowed to cool down.\"When you have a constant temperature, you can measure the steady-state heat flux, which would allow us to directly compare the heat transfer of ice versus state-of-the-art boilers,\" said Col\u00f3n.The team is also brainstorming how to implement a practical ice quenching system.\"It remains to be seen exactly how to implement three-phase heat transfer for real life applications, but we're excited to figure it out over the next several years,\" said Boreyko. \"It might involve making spray nozzles that are able to eject ice particles instead of water, or perhaps it will look more like releasing a pre-formed block of ice onto an overheated surface. There's a lot more to figure out before this becomes an on-the-shelf technology.\" More information:Jonathan R.

  "text": "Scientists have discovered yet another amazing aspect of the weird and wonderful behavior of water\u2014this time when subjected to nanoscale confinement at sub-zero temperatures.          The finding that a crystalline substance can readily give up water at temperatures as low as -70 \u00b0C, published in the journal Nature on April 12, has major implications for the development of materials designed to extract water from the atmosphere.A team of supramolecular chemists at Stellenbosch University (SU), consisting of Dr. Alan Eaby, Prof. Catharine Esterhuysen and Prof. Len Barbour, made this discovery while trying to understand the peculiar behavior of a type of crystal that first piqued their interest about ten years ago.\"Scientists are currently adept at designing materials that can absorb water,\" Barbour explains. \"However, it is much harder to get those materials (we call them 'hydrates') to then release the water without having to supply energy in the form of heat. As we all know, energy is expensive and seldom completely 'green.'\"The chemical compound in question was originally synthesized by Prof. Marcin Kwit, a specialist in organic stereochemistry at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland. It was then crystallized and brought to Barbour's lab for further study by postdoctoral fellow Dr. Agnieszka Janiak. This was mainly because of Barbour's interest in ring-shaped molecules and how they form channels when packed together in crystals.VT-SCXRD perspective view along [210] showing the evolution of difference electron density in T1-R during cooling from \u221230 to \u2212125 \u00b0C.

It didn't take her long to figure out that the crystals would only turn red on days with humidity levels higher than 55%. When humidity levels fell below this level, the crystals would go back to being yellow.\"Not only was this behavior rather unusual,\" Barbour explains, \"it was also happening very fast. It seems the crystals were absorbing water as fast at high humidity as it was losing it again at low humidity. While we are familiar with materials designed to absorb water, it is highly unusual for a material that absorbs water easily to lose it equally easily.\"Why do these crystals have such special properties? This question started a nearly ten-year investigation, which initially focused on explaining the mechanism behind the color change. Theoretical modeling by Esterhuysen and MSc student Dirkie Myburgh showed that water uptake causes slight changes in the electronic properties of the crystals, causing them to turn red. With such remarkable properties, Barbour was convinced that the crystals would also have other interesting properties.      That is when Ph.D. student Alan Eaby started dabbling with the material. Initially he had focused on room temperature studies for his MSc research but would later turn his attention to measuring properties at lower temperatures when he embarked on his Ph.D. three years ago. He wanted to know how the crystals would behave when subjected to different temperatures and humidity levels: \"I was intrigued by the color change and wanted to explore what was happening at the atomic scale,\" he explains.Having learned about developing instruments and methods from Barbour, he embarked on employing non-standard techniques to understand the mechanisms of water uptake and release in the material.One day, he observed something strange happening at temperatures below zero degrees Celsius. \"I noticed that the crystal still changed color at sub-zero temperatures. Initially I thought that there was something wrong with the experimental setup or the temperature controller, as crystal hydrates are not supposed to release water at such low temperatures,\" he explains.After lots of conversations and coffee breaks with Barbour and Esterhuysen, and tweaking the experimental setup several times, they realized that Alan's observations could be explained by the narrowness of the channels in the material. The channels in the crystal are only one nanometer wide\u2014one thousandth the diameter of a human hair.It was already known that, at the nanoscale, water can remain mobile within channels at temperatures below 0\u00b0C. However, this study showed for the first time that such channels can also allow the uptake and release of water at temperatures far below its normal freezing point.To understand this process, Eaby undertook an extensive, systematic series of X-ray diffraction studies of the red and yellow crystals at different temperatures and humidities. This allowed him to construct a computer-generated \"movie,\" with atomic-scale resolution, of what happens to the channels upon cooling or heating, and in the presence or absence of water. These animations indicated that water molecules in the nanochannels move about freely until cooled to -70 \u00b0C, whereupon they undergo a \"reversible structuring event\" to resemble a glassy state. This \"glass transition\" ultimately causes the water to become trapped in the material at temperatures below -70\u00b0C.Were it not for the color-changing behavior of the crystals in the first place, they would not have become aware of the ultralow temperature water loss capability. \"Who knows,\" says Barbour, \"there may be many other materials out there with the ability to absorb and release water at very low temperatures, such as metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks.\"We simply do not know about it because we have not been able to visualize it. Now that we do know that such behavior is possible, it opens a whole new field of research and potential applications. Researchers can use this new information to identify other materials with similar properties, and also use the principles we've developed to fine tune the low-temperatures release of water. This could lead to dramatic reductions in the energetic costs of atmospheric water harvesting, with implications for society and the environment,\" he concludes. More information:Alan C.

  "text": "The increasing CO2 emission as the chief culprit causing many environmental problems could be addressed via electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to the added-value carbon-based chemicals. Due to the unique advantages, ionic liquids (ILs) have been widely studied to promote CO2R as electrolytes and co-catalysts.          Among the potential products of CO2R, those only containing one carbon atom, named C1 products, including CO, CH3OH, CH4, and syngas, are easier to achieve than others. In the last dozen years, numerous related experimental studies and reviews have been reported to promote the development of CO2R-to-C1 products, and rapid progress has been achieved in these recent years.However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has been conducted to discuss and systematically compare the economic benefits of different C1 products (CO, CH3OH, CH4, H2/CO(1:1) and H2/CO(2:1)) focusing on the IL-based electrolyte systems, as well as analyzing environmental impacts, to give guidance for realizing the commercialization of CO2R technology in the near future.Herein, a team of scientists summarized and updated the research progress in the CO2R-to-C1 products based on the IL-based electrolytes, and comprehensively evaluated the economic benefit and environmental influence for the state-of-the-art and future potential technologies, respectively. Their work was published in Industrial Chemistry & Materials.\"As the rapid development of CO2R with ILs-based electrolyte in the lab, it is necessary to have a clear insight on their commercial value when scale-up it to an industrial scale,\" said Xiaoyan Ji, a professor at Lule\u00e5 University of Technology.\"In this review, we summarized the experimental achievements of CO2R-to-C1 products using IL-based electrolyte, evaluated their performances from both economic and environmental aspects based the state-of-the-art technology and those with improved performance in the near future, and identified their potential for commercialization. We also put forward the strategies to boost the performance and profits for CO2R-to-C1 product with ILs as the electrolyte in the future.\"CO2R is one of the most promising methods to realize the conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals because of its mild conditions, as well as its easy and flexible controllability. Besides, its driving force can be integrated with renewable sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower.      There are three main parameters to evaluate the performance of CO2R, including current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and cell voltage, which can be improved through designing and optimizing electrocatalysts and electrolytes.ILs, with their tunable structures and properties, wide electrochemical windows, and high electrical conductivities, can provide a low overpotential and high current density, and improve the product selectivity for CO2R. Significantly, ILs can effectively inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is a competitive reaction of CO2R.\"CO is the only profitable product among the studied C1 products, while the total production costs (TPC) of other products are too high to be profitable, especially for CH4 and H2/CO(2:1),\" Ji said.\"This phenomenon is consistent with the performance of CO2R for each product. The current density and FE of CO are as high as 182.2 mA cm-2 and 99.7%, respectively. However, for CH4 and H2/CO(2:1), the current densities are as low as 25.6 and 11.4 mA cm-2, respectively. Additionally, with the improved performance of CO2R, CH3OH and H2/CO(1:1) can be profitable in the near future. While it is difficult for CH4 and H2/CO(2:1) to be profitable even under the most ideal scenario, partly due to the low market price. On the other side, the formation of CH4 requires transferring the largest number of electrons (8e-) among the studied C1 products.\"\"CO2R-to-CH4 is the most environmentally friendly pathway compared to others,\" added Xiangping Zhang, a professor at the Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. \"While, considering both economic and environmental aspects, CO is the most attractive product. For other C1 products, further improvement of CO2R or the development of more advanced electrolyzers are required to realize their commercial value,\" Zhang said.Furthermore, ILs should be further exploited in the future CO2R as follows: (1) the adjustable feature of ILs in the structure and properties provides unique advantages and feasibilities for designing more efficient and suitable electrolytes of CO2R; (2) the capability of ILs to dissolve a variety of solvents and electrolytes can integrate other solvents and electrolytes, further improving the performance of CO2R; (3) the cleaner ILs can be designed and synthesized applying into CO2R to mitigate the environmental burden; (4) except as electrolytes, ILs can also be the co-catalyst or modifier for the catalyst exhibiting superior performance.\"In this review, our main goal is to provide readers with intuitionistic insight on the commercial potential of CO2R-to-C1 products with ILs as the electrolyte based on the state-of-the-art and future scenarios from both economic and environmental aspects,\" said Ji.

  "text": "Two prominent origin-of-life chemists have published a new hypothesis for how the first sugars\u2014which were necessary for life to evolve\u2014arose on the early Earth.          In a paper published on April 13, 2023, in the journal Chem, chemists from Scripps Research and the Georgia Institute of Technology propose that key sugars needed for making early life forms could have emerged from reactions involving glyoxylate (C2HO3\u2013), a relatively simple chemical that plausibly existed on the Earth before life evolved. The study is titled \"The Potential of Glyoxylate as a Prebiotic Source Molecule and a Reactant in Protometabolic Pathways\u2014The Glyoxylose Reaction.\"\"We show that our new hypothesis has key advantages over the more traditional view that early sugars arose from the chemical formaldehyde,\" says Ramanarayanan Krishnamurthy, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Chemistry at Scripps Research. Krishnamurthy's co-author was Charles Liotta, Ph.D., Regents' Professor Emeritus at the Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Chemistry and Biochemistry.Origin-of-life chemists seek to explain how the basic molecular building blocks and reactions necessary for life could have arisen from the simple chemicals that were likely present on the \"prebiotic\" Earth. The overarching aim of the field is to answer the fundamental question of how our living planet came to be. But its discoveries also can inform\u2014and have informed\u2014many other fields, from atmospheric science and geology to synthetic biology and the search for life on other planets.The three major classes of biological molecule whose availability needs to be explained by origin-of-life chemistry are: the amino acids that make up proteins, the nucleobases that make up the \"letters\" of DNA and RNA, and the sugars (also called carbohydrates) that are found throughout biology, including in the twisted backbone structure of DNA and RNA. According to the prevailing theories, amino acids probably arose from ammonia (NH3), while nucleobases arose from hydrogen cyanide (HCN).The origin of sugars has been less clear. Many scientists believe the first sugars came from reactions involving formaldehyde (CH2O), but this theory has some drawbacks.\"The formaldehyde reactions proposed by this theory are quite messy\u2014they have uncontrolled side reactions and other drawbacks due to formaldehyde's high reactivity under the envisioned early-Earth conditions,\" Liotta says.The chemists' proposed alternative is a \"glyoxylose reaction\" scenario in which glyoxylate first reacts with itself, forming a close cousin of formaldehyde known as glycolaldehyde. The researchers suggest that glyoxylate, glycolaldehyde, their byproducts and other simple compounds could have continued to react with one another, ultimately yielding simple sugars and other products\u2014without the drawbacks of formaldehyde-based reactions.Glyoxylate already has a prominent role in origin-of-life chemistry theories. Swiss chemist Albert Eschenmoser proposed in 2007 that a form of it might have been the source for multiple original biomolecules. Krishnamurthy and Furman University chemist Greg Springsteen, Ph.D., also suggested in a 2020 Nature Chemistry paper that glyoxylate could have helped initiate a primordial version of the modern (tricarboxylic acid) TCA cycle, a basic metabolic process found in most life forms on Earth.Krishnamurthy and his team are currently working to demonstrate in the laboratory that the glyoxylose reaction scenario could indeed have yielded the first sugars.\"Such a demonstration would expand the role of glyoxylate as a versatile molecule in prebiotic chemistry and further stimulate the search for its own origin on the prebiotic Earth,\" Krishnamurthy says.The chemists are also looking into potential commercial applications of reactions that make glyoxylate, since these effectively consume CO2 and thus can be used to reduce CO2 levels, either locally in industrial settings or globally to combat global warming.

  "text": "Low-methoxy (LM) pectin gels have gained momentum in tissue engineering and drug delivery in recent years due to their excellent biocompatibility. LM pectin forms stable hydrogels by forming supramolecular assemblies with egg-box structures in the presence of divalent ions like Ca2+, generally provided by a calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution or calcium carbonate (CaCO3). In particular, the use of CaCO3 enables the preparation of LM pectin gels with controlled shape.          Previous research has shown that minute changes in hydrogel synthesis precursor parameters can majorly impact the hydrogel properties and their applications. For instance, decreasing the pH or acidifying the precursor accelerates the gelation rate and increases the mechanical strength of LM pectin hydrogels. CO2 is a popular acidic agent because it can decrease pH and be easily removed from the system after gelation.However, despite CO2 being a promising acidic agent, a precise understanding of its effects on hydrogel synthesis and properties is poorly understood.A group of scientists from Japan, led by Mr. Ryota Teshima, a Master's student from Tokyo University of Science (TUS), decided to fill this gap. To do so, they prepared LM pectin/CaCO3 hydrogels using the standard method and under controlled thermodynamic conditions with carbonated water as the source of CO2.The research team also included Dr. Shigehito Osawa (currently at Tokyo Women's Medical University), and Dr. Yayoi Kawano, Prof. Takehisa Hanawa, Prof. Akihiko Kikuchi, and Prof. Hidenori Otsuka from TUS. Their research was published in ACS Omega.Explaining the reasoning behind this approach, Mr. Teshima says, \"We chose carbonated water as the acidic agent for gelation because conventional methods would require high-pressure conditions to ensure proper supply of CO2 to the hydrogel precursor. Instead, using carbonated water allowed us to supply carbonate ions and CO2 to the hydrogel mixture and trigger gelation under ambient pressure and temperature conditions.\"The team simultaneously prepared two LM pectin/CaCO3 hydrogels\u2014one with added carbonated water and the other without. They observed that the one with carbonated water underwent faster gelation and showed increased mechanical strength compared to the one without.These improvements could arise from the lower pH of carbonated water enhancing the solubility of CaCO3, which further increases the availability of free Ca2+ ions. More Ca2+ means better cross-linking between pectin polymers, quicker gelation, and more robust hydrogels.After the hydrogel formation, carbonated water/CO2 was volatilized from the surface in contact with the atmosphere. The team found that post-CO2 escape, the pH of the final hydrogel was higher than the hydrogel prepared without carbonated water. The team suggested this could be because many carboxy groups were consumed during cross-linking. with Ca2+ and the acidic component, CO2, was completely volatilized from the hydrogels after gelation.The team further prepared aerogels by freeze-drying the hydrogels. They found highly ordered networks of elongated porosity in those prepared through the carbonated water route, suggesting that the CO2 from carbonated water could induce intrinsic structural changes in the hydrogels.The researchers also prepared hydrogels with different amounts of CO2 in the carbonated water to demonstrate that the pH and strength of LM pectin hydrogels can be tuned in this manner. The insights from this study can prove helpful when fabricating functional hydrogels with tailored properties.This research contributes to the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs), as the LM pectin was primarily derived from food waste, such as apple and citrus fruits. \"Every year, 2.5 billion tons of food is wasted worldwide, which includes vegetables and fruits that are discarded without ever reaching the market because of quality issues. We believe that the promising results of our study will encourage other researchers to use items thrown out as food waste as raw materials for their scientific ventures,\" concludes Mr. Teshima.

  "text": "There is a need for new drugs. For example, many of the antibiotics that we have been using for a long time are becoming less effective. Chemists and pharmaceutical scientists are frantically searching for new active substances, especially those that can penetrate cell membranes, as these are the only ones that patients can take orally in the form of a tablet or syrup.          Only active ingredients pass through the intestinal wall in the small intestine and enter the bloodstream to reach the affected area in the body. For active ingredients that cannot penetrate the cell membrane, physicians have no choice but to inject them directly into the bloodstream.Large molecules with potentialThat is why researchers are trying to understand which molecules can penetrate cell membranes and how exactly they do this. For one important and promising class of substances\u2014cyclic peptides\u2014chemists at ETH Zurich have now decoded additional details of the relevant mechanism. \"The more we know about this mechanism and the properties a molecule must have, the earlier and more effectively researchers can take this into account when developing new drugs,\" says Sereina Riniker, a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences. She led the study, which has now been published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.Cyclic peptides are ring-shaped molecules that are much larger than the small molecules that make up the majority of today's drugs. In some areas of application, however, chemists and pharmaceutical scientists are coming up against their limits with small molecules, which is why they are turning to larger molecules like the cyclic peptides. This substance class includes many pharmaceutically active natural substances, such as cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant that for decades has been used after organ transplants, and many antibiotics.Possible only with computer modelingUsing computer modeling and a lot of supercomputer power, Riniker and her colleagues were able to elucidate how cyclic peptides similar to cyclosporine cross a membrane. \"Only modeling allows us such detailed, high-resolution insights, as there are no experiments that would let us observe an individual molecule crossing a membrane,\" Riniker says.To understand the mechanism, one must know how cyclic peptides are structured: they consist of a central ring structure to which side chains are attached. The molecules are flexible and can dynamically change their structure to adapt to their environment.      Dance through the cell membraneRiniker's simulations reveal in detail how a cyclic peptide penetrates the membrane: First, the molecule anchor itself to the membrane's surface, before penetrating it perpendicular to the membrane. It then changes its three-dimensional shape while passing through, rotating once about its longitudinal axis before reaching the other side of the membrane, where it exits again.These changes in shape have to do with the different environments the molecule experiences as it moves through the membrane: The body consists largely of water. Both inside and outside of cells, biochemical molecules are mostly present in aqueous solution. Cell membranes, on the other hand, are made up of fatty acids, so water-repellent conditions prevail within them. \"To enable it to cross the membrane, the cyclic peptide changes its three-dimensional shape to briefly become as hydrophobic as possible,\" Riniker explains.Changing molecular side chainsFor the present study, the researchers investigated eight different cyclic peptides. These are model peptides with no medicinal effect\u2014scientists at pharmaceutical giant Novartis developed them for basic research, which is why Riniker also collaborated with Novartis researchers for this study.The new findings can now be used in discovering cyclic peptides as new drug candidates. However, Riniker points out a certain trade-off: there are side chains that provide ideal conditions for cyclic peptides to anchor to the membrane surface, but that make it difficult for the peptides to cross the membrane. This new knowledge helps researchers to give advance thought to which side chains they want to use and where on the molecule they are most helpful.All of this could speed up drug discovery and development by ensuring right from the outset that researchers are investigating potential active ingredients that can eventually be taken as a tablet.

Today, most kimchi is made through mass fermentation in glass, steel, or plastic containers, but it has long been claimed that the highest quality kimchi is fermented in onggi.          Kimchi purists now have scientific validation, thanks to recent research from David Hu, professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech, and Soohwan Kim, a second-year Ph.D. student in Hu's lab.In a combined experimental and theoretical study, Hu and Kim measured carbon dioxide levels in onggi during kimchi fermentation and developed a mathematical model to show how the gas was generated and moved through the onggi's porous walls. By bringing the study of fluid mechanics to bear on an ancient technology, their research highlights the work of artisans and provides the missing link for how the traditional earthenware allows for high quality kimchi.Their research was published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.\"We wanted to find the 'secret sauce' for how onggi make kimchi taste so good,\" Hu said. \"So, we measured how the gases evolved while kimchi fermented inside the onggi\u2014something no one had done before.\"The porous structure of these earthenware vessels mimics the loose soil where lactic acid bacteria\u2014known for their healthy probiotic nature\u2014are found. While previous studies have shown that kimchi fermented in onggi has more lactic acid bacteria, no one knew exactly how the phenomenon is connected to the unique material properties of the container.First, Kim obtained a traditional, handmade onggi jar from an artisan in his hometown in Jeju, South Korea, a region famous for onggi. Back at Georgia Tech, Hu and Kim first tested the permeability of the onggi by observing how water evaporated through the container over time.Next, they installed carbon dioxide and pressure sensors into both the onggi and a typical, hermetically sealed glass jar. They prepared their own salted cabbage and placed it in both containers. They then used the sensors to measure and compare the change in carbon dioxide\u2014a signature of fermentation.Hu and Kim also developed a mathematical model based on the porosity of the onggi. The model allowed them to infer the generation rate of carbon dioxide, since the onggi lets carbon dioxide out gradually.      They concluded that the onggi's porous walls permitted the carbon dioxide to escape the container, which accelerated the speed of fermentation. The onggi's porosity also functioned as a \"safety valve,\" resulting in a slower increase in carbon dioxide levels than the glass jar while blocking the entry of external particles. Their data revealed that the carbon dioxide level in onggi was less than half of that in glass containers.                A cross-sectional view of onggi showing fermenting cabbage. Credit: Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism             They also found that the beneficial bacteria in the onggi-made kimchi proliferated 26% more than in the glass counterpart. In the glass jar, the lactic acid bacteria became suffocated by their own carbon dioxide in the closed glass container. It turns out that because the onggi releases carbon dioxide in small rates, the lactic acid bacteria are happier and reproduce more.\"Onggi were designed without modern knowledge of chemistry, microbiology, or fluid mechanics, but they work remarkably well,\" Kim said. \"It's very interesting to get these new insights into ancient technology through the lens of fluid dynamics.\"Onggi's semiporous nature is unique compared to other forms of earthenware. A clay container that leaks, but only slightly, is not easy to make. Terra cotta containers, for example, quickly leak water.\"It's amazing that for thousands of years, people have been building these special containers out of dirt, but in many ways, they are very high tech,\" Hu said. \"We discovered that the right amount of porosity enables kimchi to ferment faster, and these onggi provide that.\"Kim said that some artisans still use ancient methods when making onggi, but their numbers are decreasing. Now, the market is flooded with inauthentic versions of the vessels.\"We hope this study draws attention to this traditional artisan work and inspires energy-efficient methods for fermenting and storing foods,\" he said. \"Also, the onggi are quite beautiful.\" More information:Soohwan Kim et al, Onggi's permeability to carbon dioxide accelerates kimchi fermentation, Journal of The Royal Society Interface (2023).

  "text": "Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a useful technique that has been widely utilized in our lives, ranging from reconstructive plastic surgery to artificial organ production. However, many biopolymers, such as nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and proteins, cannot be readily constructed into a desired 3D shape at the submicron- or nanoscale due to their inherent rheological and structural properties. Can we truly achieve the free-form and high-resolution structuring of various biomolecules using 3D printing technology?          A team of researchers from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at POSTECH led by Professor Seung Soo Oh, Professor Emeritus Jung Ho Je, Dr. Moon-Jung Yong, and Ph.D. candidates Un Yang and Byunghwa Kang has developed a groundbreaking 3D printing technology that directly allows precise writing and patterning of various biopolymers with full mechanical stability and functional integrity.Their findings have been published in Advanced Science.The research team has presented a novel 3D printing strategy that preserves the folding structure and molecular function of various biopolymers by sequentially confining, evaporating, and solidifying a biopolymer-containing solution.Irrespective of biopolymer types, this technique can produce 3D biopolymeric architectures with precisely-controlled size and geometry at submicron resolution.Furthermore, it allows the printed biopolymers to exhibit their own desired functions, thereby achieving pin-point localization of spatiotemporal biofunctions, including molecular recognition and catalytic reactions.                3D nanopatterns of biopolymers. The new printing technology allows for precise construction of 3D patterns using various biopolymers such as nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and proteins in the form of pillar and arch-shaped nanowires. Credit: POSTECH             This 3D printing technique can be applied in various fields by utilizing the principle that at molecular levels, the evaporation and solidification of pure biopolymer-containing solution occurs regardless of the biopolymer type. It is also highly advantageous that this printing process does not cause any damage or deformation to the biopolymers, due to a mild processing environment under room temperature and ambient air without any additives.This breakthrough is expected to have wide-ranging applications in the development of materials that can analyze and mimic microscale biological tissues. It can be also applicable to manufacture artificial cells and tissues that can function properly in a biological environment, as well as to produce biochips. The researchers now plan to develop next-generation cell-mimicking device printing methods for practical diagnostics and drug development.\"The significance of this research lies in proving for the first time the possibility of printing 100% functionally and structurally active biopolymers in ultrafine 3D structures,\" emphasized Professor Seung Soo Oh, the POSTECH team leader.

  "text": "Epoxy resin monomers used in industry can result in severe contact allergies. Researchers at the University of Gothenburg have now developed a new type of epoxy resin monomer that is far less allergenic and is based on a renewable material. The epoxy resin monomers used today contain residues of the endocrine disruptor Bisphenol A (BPA). The new monomer derived from ordinary sugar is not based on BPA.          Epoxy resin monomers have been used for a long time in the construction industry and, more recently, in the production of the plastics used in wind turbines. The monomer is produced from BPA, which is derived from petroleum. The risk of developing a contact allergy when handling epoxy resin monomers is considerable, and sometimes it is not even enough to wear protective clothing.\"When we started our research, we had three goals. The monomer should be far less allergenic, be based on an easily accessible and renewable starting material, and not based on BPA, which is a known endocrine disruptor,\" says Kristina Luthman, Professor of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Gothenburg.Hazardous residues remain in the polymerEpoxy resin polymers are formed by allowing two substances to react with each other. One of these substances, called DGEBA (Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether), is reactive and helps to produce durable and cured plastics. But even after curing, the epoxy resin polymer still has residues of the contact allergenic DGEBA and the endocrine disruptor BPA, both of which entail health risks.Researchers at the University of Gothenburg have now developed a new epoxy resin monomer based on isosorbide, which is a substance produced from glucose\u2014in other words, ordinary sugar. Those who handle the epoxy resin monomers will gain most from this research.\"If the monomer is less allergenic, this is of great practical importance. It may then be enough to wear protective clothing, which is not always the case today,\" says Kristina Luthman.Cheap input materialAnother advantage of the new material is that it is made from a renewable starting material (sugar beet), and not fossil oil as is the case with today's epoxy resin monomers.The next step will be to test the monomer produced and see if it has the right properties for use as a substitute for today's epoxy resin monomers in industrial applications. As it is derived from sugar, the material is cheap.\"Usability and cost-effectiveness will be questions for the plastics industry to address. One obstacle is that BPA is cheap and useful for creating plastics with a variety of properties. So it may be difficult to convince industry to make the switch. But if the use of BPA is regulated more strictly within the EU, that will put the matter in a whole different light,\" says Kristina Luthman.The study is published in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology.

  "text": "Single-use hard plastics are pervasive: utensils, party decorations and food containers, to name a few examples. These items pile up in landfills, and many biodegradable versions stick around for months, requiring industrial composting systems to fully degrade. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering have created a sturdy, lightweight material that disintegrates on-demand\u2014and they made it from sugar and wood-derived powders.       Sturdy, degradable materials made from plants and other non-petroleum sources have come a long way in recent years. For example, cornstarch-based packing peanuts disappear simply by dousing them in water, and some utensils are based on polymers synthesized from plant sugars.But those packing peanuts can't be used to protect anything wet, and plant-derived polymers still take a long time to break down. One potential alternative is a new type of rigid material designed from isomalt, which is a sugar alcohol rather than a polymer. With isomalt, bakers can create breathtaking, but brittle, structures for desserts, and then dissolve them away quickly in water. So, Scott Phillips and colleagues wanted to boost the sturdiness of isomalt with natural additives to create a robust material that degrades on-demand.The researchers heated isomalt to a liquid-like state and mixed in either cellulose, cellulose and sawdust, or wood flour to produce three different materials. Then, using commercial plastics manufacturing equipment, the materials were extruded into small pellets and molded into various objects, including balls, a dodecahedron, a chess piece and flower-shaped saucers.All of the tested additives doubled the strength of isomalt, creating materials that were harder than plastics, including poly(ethylene terephthalate) (known as PET) and poly(vinyl chloride) (known as PVC), but were still lightweight. In experiments, samples dissolved in water within minutes.And saucers made of the material, and coated with a food grade shellac and cellulose acetate, withstood being immersed in water for up to seven days. However, once the saucers were broken and the coating cracked, they rapidly disintegrated in water. The team also repeatedly crushed, dissolved and recycled both coated and uncoated objects into new ones that were still as strong as the original items.The researchers say that the material could be used for food-service items and temporary d\u00e9cor, and then crushed and sprayed with water to fall apart. But even if such items were simply tossed into the trash or somehow got into the environment, the slightest crack in the coating would start their collapse into sugars and the plant-based additives, which the researchers say might be good for soil.

  "text": "Yin-Yang theory is an ancient Chinese philosophy in which Yin-Yang forces are interdependent and work in opposition to each other to create balance.          Recently, inspired by this ancient theory, a research team led by Prof. Guo Xin and Prof. Li Can from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has revealed the origin of the stability of Dion\u2013Jacobson (DJ) phase two-dimensional (2D) perovskite materials.Their findings were published in Joule.DJ 2D perovskites, a class of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, have been widely used for various optoelectronic applications.Compared to traditional 3D perovskites with intrinsically low stability, 2D perovskites including the Ruddlesden\u2013Popper (RP) phase and DJ phase are more attractive due to their enhanced stability, especially DJ 2D perovskites based on organic diammonium cations and inorganic lead iodide octahedra, which have higher structural stability than RP ones.However, some of DJ 2D perovskites are not robust and even more easily degraded than RP 2D counterparts, which has led to a controversy over their stability. These contradictory research results have impelled scientists to clearly elucidate the stability mechanism of DJ 2D perovskites with different diammonium cations.In this study, the researchers demonstrated that the stability of DJ 2D perovskites was determined by the rigidity of organic diammonium cations, which could induce co-adaptation of organic and inorganic components to stabilize the 2D structure. Specifically, the medium cation rigidity allowed for organic diammoniums and inorganic octahedra to regulate their geometries in mutual accommodation in order to reach a stabilized state.This mechanism may provide guidance for researchers who want to consciously manipulate the stability of DJ 2D perovskites by adjusting cation rigidity.\"Similar to the two parties in the Yin-Yang theory, organic cations and inorganic octahedra in DJ 2D perovskites are interconnected with alternating hydrogen bonds and when both parts can adjust their geometries to adapt to each other, strong connections are desirable,\" said Prof. Guo. \"In this way, organic cations with moderate rigidity would play a critical role in the process of intercoordination because they have a certain degree of freedom to regulate the geometry and the inorganic part can correspondingly change its configuration as well.\" More information:Yang Liu et al, Revealing stability origin of Dion-Jacobson 2D perovskites with different-rigidity organic cations, Joule (2023).

  "text": "Whether wriggling your toes or lifting groceries, muscles in your body smoothly expand and contract. Some polymers can do the same thing\u2014acting like artificial muscles\u2014but only when stimulated by dangerously high voltages. Now, researchers in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces report a series of thin, elastic films that respond to substantially lower electrical charges. The materials represent a step toward artificial muscles that could someday operate safely in medical devices.          Artificial muscles could become key components of movable soft robotic implants and functional artificial organs. Electroactive elastomers, such as bottlebrush polymers, are attractive materials for this purpose because they start soft but stiffen when stretched. And they can change shape when electrically charged. However, currently available bottlebrush polymer films only move at voltages more than 4,000 V, which exceeds the 50 V maximum that the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration states is safe.Reducing the thickness of these films to less than 100 \u00b5m could lower the required voltages, but this hasn't been done successfully yet for bottlebrush polymers. So, Dorina Opris and colleagues wanted to find a simple way to produce thinner films.The researchers synthesized a suite of bottlebrush polymers by reacting norbornene-grafted polydimethylsiloxane macromonomers and cross-linking the products by ultraviolet light. A 60-\u00b5m-thick material was the most electroactive, expanding more than previously reported elastomers, with an operating voltage of 1,000 V. And a circular actuator made out of that material expanded and contracted more than 10,000 times before degrading.In another set of experiments, the researchers introduced polar side chains to the polymers and produced materials that responded to voltages as low as 800 V. However, they didn't expand as much as the team's most electroactive film. Based on the results, the researchers say that, with some tweaks, the material could someday be used to develop durable implants and other medical devices that work at safer voltages.

  "answer_squad": " Kolbe electrolysis",
  "text": "A team of chemists from Scripps Research and Abbvie Process Research and Development has found that making a couple of minor changes to Kolbe coupling allows for easily making high-cost materials out of low-cost materials or even waste products. Their study is reported in the journal Science. Peng Guo and Ke-Yin Ye, both with Fuzhou University, in China, have published a Perspective piece in the same journal issue outlining the work by the team on this this effort.          Kolbe coupling was first described by Michael Faraday back in 1834, but it was not well known until Hermann Kolbe used it in 1849 to couple pairs of molecules in a substance containing a carboxylic acid. Thus, it bears his name. It is currently considered to be one of the oldest known reactions in organic chemistry.The reaction occurs when a platinum electrode is inserted into the mix and electricity applied. Thus, the reaction is sometimes referred to as Kolbe electrolysis. It also results in the release of carbon dioxide. But the reaction usually has other unfortunate outcomes, as well, such as oxidizing other materials in the mix, which is why it is rarely used. In this new effort, the research team was studying decarboxylation for another project when they found they had made adjustments to Kolbe coupling, and found that doing so provided unexpected benefits.In their work, the researchers had been using rapid alternating polarity (rAP) in their work, which they applied to the new effort. Also, instead of using platinum electrodes, they were using electrodes that were carbon-based. They noted that because they were using rAP, oxidizing of functional groups was avoided.Intrigued by their finding, the team conduced Kolbe coupling experiments with the two adjustments. They bought a bottle of castor oil and used it to make 10-undecenoic acid. They then inserted an electrode and conducted rAP. The ensuing reaction produced 1,19-eicosadiene, a material that typically costs approximately $10,000 per gram.Next, the group produced diol, which they mixed with a diketone to create a degradable ketal-polymer. They suggest that it could also be used to convert side-chain carboxylic acids to other products or perhaps to convert succinic acid esters into adipic acid esters.

  "text": "A research team led by Professor Hongzhe Sun from the Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, The University of Hong Kong, has published a paper titled \"Mitochondrial ATP synthase as a direct molecular target of chromium(III) to ameliorate hyperglycaemia stress\" in Nature Communications.          The researchers found that, chromium(III) (Cr(III)), a nutritional supplement, can enhance cells' ability to metabolize glucose by regulating ATP synthase activity. This process improves mitochondrial deformation caused by high glucose levels and significantly boosts glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetic mice.To uncover the protein targets of Cr(III) and elucidate the molecular mechanism, the team developed a fluorescent probe for detecting transient metal-protein interactions, achieving a high spatiotemporal resolution tracking of the Cr(III) proteome in HepG2 cells. This led to the identification of Cr(III)-binding proteins within cells.The team then revealed that Cr(III) replaces magnesium ions (Mg2+) in ATP synthase, reduces ATP synthase activity, and activates the downstream AMPK pathway, resulting in improved glucose metabolism. This study provides a novel concept for hypoglycemic research.\"Although Cr(III) compounds have long been used as a nutritional supplement for diabetes treatment, weight loss and muscle development, its protein target and mechanism of action remain concealed for over half a century. We used a novel fluorescent probe, along with other chemical biology approaches, to uncover the long-standing scientific problem of the biological chemistry of Cr(III) and discovered that Cr(III) targets ATP synthase to regulate glucose,\" said Professor Sun.Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disease with over 500 million patients worldwide, cause nearly 2 million direct deaths each year. Over 95% of diabetic patients suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which poses a serious threat to human health. The effect of Cr(III) on anti-type 2 diabetes has been extensively studied in animal models. Since the initial discovery that Cr(III) supplementation in rat diets increased blood sugar removal rates, Cr(III) has been widely used in nutritional supplements for diabetes treatment, weight loss and muscle development. In fact, it is the second best-selling supplement in U.S., just after the mineral calcium.Despite its significance in food and nutritional science, chromium remains one of the least understood transition metals in the periodic table. For more than half a century, the importance, pharmacological properties, and mechanisms of action of Cr(III) in human physiology have been debated. The originally conceived low-molecular-weight chromium(III)-binding peptide (chromodulin) has never been reproducibly identified. Cr(III) is widely believed to improve glucose metabolism, maintain normal blood sugar levels, regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and enhance insulin signaling.However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown, and the bottleneck in uncovering such a molecular mechanism lies in the difficulty in identifying Cr(III)'s molecular targets in cells. These biomolecules are crucial for elucidating Cr(III)'s physiological and pharmacological effects, constituting the so-called \"Holy Grail\" of chromium biochemistry.To date, no proteins that directly bind Cr(III) have been identified in cells or tissues. Various controversial separation and detection methods often produce weak Cr(III) signals, which might be attributed to the dissociation of Cr(III) from its bound proteins. Currently, there is no suitable method for tracking Cr(III)-binding proteins in living cells. For metals that bind weakly or transiently to proteins, labeling metalloproteins with a small molecule fluorescent probe is beneficial for understanding their spatiotemporal distribution and functional regulation in living cells.      Key findingsBuilding on their previous work, the team synthesized a fluorescent probe for tracking and recognizing Cr(III)-binding proteins in living cells. The probe consists of three parts: a fluorophore (coumarin derivative (AC), a metal chelating group (i.e., nitrilotriacetate (NTA)) and a photoactive crosslinking group (i.e., arylazide). Upon chelation with chromium (III), the probe enters the cell, subsequently binds its target proteins, and the arylazide group forms a covalent bond with Cr(III)-binding proteins (i.e., target proteins) upon ultraviolet light irradiation. This leads to fixing the Cr(III)-binding proteins in cells without dissociation during downstream purification.Using these probes, the team monitored the distribution of Cr(III)-binding proteins in living cells, and found that they were concentrated in the cells' mitochondria. These proteins were identified in conjunction with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The researchers discovered that Cr(III) binds residues of Thr213 and Glu242 in ATP synthase's active site, replacing magnesium ion (Mg2+), reducing ATP synthase activity, and leading to AMPK activation. The AMPK pathway then alleviates mitochondrial damage caused by high glucose and improves glucose metabolism. This mode of action was successfully verified in a mouse model of type II diabetes.This study addresses how Cr(III) improves hyperglycemic stress at the molecular level for the first time. With the identification of multiple Cr(III)-binding proteins, this study also opens a new horizon for further investigation of the pharmacological role of Cr(III) in other diseases other than anti-diabetes, such as anti-neurodegenerative diseases and anti-aging new horizons.The reviewers speak highly of this work. \"It is an immensely important aspect of basic science and its implications for human health, and it is exactly what is needed: the identification of molecular targets, an endeavor that has met with rather limited success in the last 70 years. Chromium supplements are a huge market worldwide (sold for weight loss, and muscle building). With controversies about their mode of action, it is rather questionable gambling with our health. Thus, the work addresses a major health issue that needs to be carefully evaluated for either the protection of large populations or the benefit for them concerning antidiabetic actions of chromium(III). The authors address chromium biology with a new approach of chemical biology and an impressive number of biochemical, molecular biological, and animal experiments.\" More information:Haibo Wang et al, Mitochondrial ATP synthase as a direct molecular target of chromium(III) to ameliorate hyperglycaemia stress, Nature Communications (2023).

The scientists report their findings in the current issue of the journal Nature Communications.\"Our previous article on the discovery of this enzyme in the summer of 2021 already made big waves,\" says Dr. Christian Sonnendecker, who played a key role in the first publication. \"This outstanding teamwork became the most successful research article to date in the journal ChemSusChem.\"To understand how the biocatalyst works, lead author Konstantin Richter first used crystals to elucidate the spatial structure of the enzyme in his doctoral thesis. \"In a way, we were following up on the determination of the first structure of a PET-degrading enzyme,\" says Professor Norbert Str\u00e4ter, who heads the crystallographic investigations. \"That was almost 10 years ago, when Wolfgang Zimmermann established this biotechnological enzyme research in Leipzig. At that time, hardly anyone had it on their radar.\"To extract the secrets of PHL7's highly efficient reaction acceleration from the static crystal structures, Christian Sonnendecker enlisted the help of other experts in his research. The working groups led by Georg K\u00fcnze and Christian Wiebeler used computer simulations of protein dynamics as well as quantum chemical calculations to understand the reaction mechanism and, in particular, the contribution of individual amino acids to the binding of the PET polymer, and to design better enzymes. \"These predictions and calculations are extremely helpful in rationally improving an enzyme,\" explains Sonnendecker, \"but in the end, of course, the experiment decides.\"                PET film degradation and thermal stability of PHL7 variants. a PET film weight loss after reaction times of 4\u2009h and 8\u2009h at 70\u00b0C, data normalized to PHL7 WT. b PET film weight loss (in weight %, after 16\u2009h) of PHL7 WT compared to variants with reduced thermal stability at lower reaction temperatures. c Analysis of PET film thickness reduction between 10\u2009h to 15\u2009h of reaction by impedance spectroscopy (n\u2009=\u20095 replicates). d Melting temperatures of PHL7 WT and its variants.

DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-37415-x             There was considerable agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical calculations. \"We realized the proposed changes to the enzyme by genetic engineering and were able to further increase both its activity and its stability, which is enormously important for technical applications.\" Too strong binding of the enzyme to the polymeric plastic substrate would be counterproductive, the biochemist explains with regard to the proposed sliding mechanism, according to which a binding channel leads the substrate to the active center. \"Sometimes less is more,\" says Sonnendecker.      When asked what the future holds for the research, Sonnendecker explains his plans for the interdisciplinary research network: \"Together with the expert J\u00f6rg Matysik, we want to use newly developed methods of nuclear resonance spectroscopy to investigate the binding of the enzyme to the polymer substrate. This will bring our experiments closer than ever to the real processes of protein-plastic interaction.\"Work is already underway on the third generation of the enzyme, extending human rational design to include machine prediction using artificial intelligence. \"For this, we have completely new screening methods at our disposal, such as the so-called impedance spectroscopy platform recently developed by Ronny Frank, which feeds high-quality training data to the AI,\" Sonnendecker explains.However, the early career researcher from the Institute of Analytical Chemistry at the Leipzig University sees the future primarily in bioplastics, which are based on renewable raw materials instead of petroleum-based ones and are also more readily biodegradable from the outset. A company is being set up to make his vision a reality.\"In the medium term, we are establishing a technological alternative to the fossil-dominated plastics industry and creating artificial CO2 storage,\" says Sonnendecker, who sees a \"green future with a view to plant-based raw materials.\" More information:P.

  "text": "They flash as a warning, glow red on standby mode, and light up your dinner table; light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have become indispensable in our daily lives. Somewhat less well-known, but just as ubiquitous, are organic light-emitting diodes, or OLEDs for short. This technology is used in the screens of smartphones, tablets and monitors. It is cheaper to produce in the form of a thin-film component, but cannot yet compete with conventional LEDs in some ways, such as in light output and lifespan.          In the search for new molecules that possess the characteristics needed for OLEDs, compounds known as helicenes are playing a central role. Helicenes are a group of substances in which rings made up of six carbon atoms (benzene rings) are joined together in a helical structure. When synthesizing these compounds, it was previously difficult to control the direction in which the molecules twist\u2014their \"chirality.\" It was only possible with certain types of helicenes and to a very limited extent.A new concept in synthesisProfessor Olivier Baudoin, Dr. Shu-Min Guo and Soohee Huh from the University of Basel's Department of Chemistry have just made an important step forward. In the latest issue of Nature Chemistry, they describe a new concept in the synthesis of these important chiral molecules.In their synthesis route, the Basel researchers make use of a reaction that can split a carbon-hydrogen and carbon-bromine bond and create a carbon-carbon bond. This is called C-H activation, and over the past few years it has developed into a valuable tool in synthesis. This method allows chemists to create helicenes with the desired chirality, and could also be suitable for longer chains of benzene rings.Researchers at Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay in France have been able to demonstrate that the products synthesized by the team from Basel strongly absorb and emit circularly polarized light\u2014an important characteristic for the development of new materials that rely on twisted molecules, as OLEDs do.\"Our results show the great potential of this strategy for the synthesis of such complex functional molecules,\" says Olivier Baudoin. In their next step, he and his team intend to synthesize more complex helicenes with improved characteristics.

  "answer_squad": " 7000 m2/g",
  "text": "Contaminated drinking water poses a major threat to our health. However, various pollutants such as pesticides, herbicides, hormones, medicines and other chemical compounds cannot be completely removed from groundwater with the methods currently available. At the same time, contamination by these substances is steadily increasing. A current example is glyphosate, which is used worldwide for weed control and poses potential dangers to humans and the environment.          A team led by Prof. Dominik Eder (TU Wien, Institute of Materials Chemistry) has now developed a new class of materials\u2014so-called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)\u2014which can be used to selectively and efficiently remove the herbicide glyphosate from groundwater. The researchers recently published their results in the scientific journal Advanced Functional Materials.Small volume, large surfaceMOFs are materials consisting of tiny metal oxide clusters connected by organic molecules to form a highly porous, sponge-like network. They have an extremely large surface area of up to 7000 m\u00b2/g. \" This means that you can fit an entire football field within just one gram of MOFs,\" Dominik Eder says. \"Consequently, a lot of molecules can adsorb within the pores, making MOFs ideal materials for directly capturing molecules from air and water, such as CO2, inorganic salts and organic pollutants.\"The special thing about MOFs is that they can be customized depending on the application. Shaghayegh Naghdi, lead author of the study, explains: \"Think of MOFs as a large building consisting of individual tiny blocks. Each block is made up of metal atoms or organic molecules and you put them together like a puzzle to achieve the desired functions.\"'Mesopores for large moleculesHowever, a crucial limitation of MOFs for their use in liquid media is the accessibility of active sites deep inside the material, where the adsorption processes and chemical reactions take place. To reach these sites, the target molecules must diffuse through micropores with diameters of less than 1 nanometer, which is often the size of the molecules themselves. In liquid media, solvent molecules can significantly slow down this diffusion process and clog the pores.To solve this problem, the research group has developed a strategy to incorporate additional pores with a diameter of up to 10 nanometers, so-called mesopores, into the MOFs. How does this work? \"We selectively burn away a certain part of the organic compound molecules,\" Naghdi explains. \"However, we need to do this very carefully, in order to avoid collapse of the overall micropore structure.\" The team has already tested this strategy for various applications in liquid media.Successful removal of glyphosateIn collaboration with researchers from the University of Northern British Columbia in Canada, Dominik Eder's team finally investigated the adsorption of glyphosate from groundwater. Remarkably, the new material was able to remove three times as much glyphosate in only 20% of the time as the currently best adsorbent.With the help of computer simulations carried out at the Technion in Israel, the group also discovered that the removal of the organic linkers creates new metal sites. These allow the formation of chemical bonds with glyphosate and thus faster diffusion of the target molecule. \"These bonds are strong enough to adsorb glyphosate and similar organic compounds very quickly and efficiently. Yet, they are weak enough to remove glyphosate quantitatively with a simple sodium chloride salt solution, so that these MOFs can be used multiple times,\" Dominik Eder explains.

  "text": "They've been called \"dream\" plastics: polyhydroxyalkanoates, or PHAs. Already the basis of a fledgling industry, they're a class of polymers naturally created by living microorganisms, or synthetically produced from biorenewable feedstocks. They're biodegradable in the ambient environment, including oceans and soil.          But there's a reason PHAs haven't taken off as a sustainable, environmentally benign alternative to traditional plastics. Crystalline PHAs are brittle, so not as durable and convenient as conventional plastics. They cannot easily be melt-processed and recycled, making them expensive to produce.Colorado State University polymer chemists led by Eugene Chen, University Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemistry, have created a synthetic PHA platform that addresses each of these problems, paving the way for a future in which PHAs can take off in the marketplace as truly sustainable plastics.Chen and colleagues report a new class of redesigned PHAs, readily accessible via chemical catalysis, in the journal Science.The researchers had been searching for a strategy to address the intrinsic thermal instability of conventional PHAs; their lack of heat resistance also makes it difficult to melt-process them into end products. The CSU chemists made fundamental changes to the structures of these plastics, substituting reactive hydrogen atoms responsible for thermal degradation with more robust methyl groups. This structural modification drastically enhances the PHAs' thermal stability, resulting in plastics that can be melt-processed without decomposition.What's more, these newly designed PHAs are mechanically tough, even outperforming the two most common commodity plastics: high-density polyethylene\u2014used in products like milk and shampoo bottles\u2014and isotactic propylene, which is used to make automotive parts and synthetic fibers. The best part is that the new PHA can be chemically recycled back to its building-block molecule, called a monomer, with a simple catalyst and heat, and the recovered clean monomer can be reused to reproduce the same PHA again\u2014in principle, infinitely.\"We are adding three key desired features to the biological PHAs, including closed-loop chemical recycling, which is essential for achieving a circular PHA economy,\" Chen said.

The authors review a flurry of recent papers demonstrating that animals extensively recycle biochemical waste to produce novel chemicals that play key roles in biology, from regulating behavior to development and aging.       These studies show that the genes previously thought to code for carboxylesterases, enzymes that hydrolyze esters, actually play a pivotal role in assembling a wide range of new metabolites from building blocks generally considered \"cellular waste.\" Surprisingly, the so-called carboxylesterases were found to contribute to the formation of esters and amide bonds, a function opposite to that predicted by computational algorithms.\"This discovery reveals that our understanding of biochemistry remains largely incomplete,\" says the perspective's lead author, Frank Schroeder, a professor at Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI). \"This research has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of how animals, including humans, function.\"Recent investigations indicate that animals and humans may produce over 100,000 distinct chemicals, most of which have not been investigated. This unknown structure space is a treasure trove of chemicals, which may hold the key to understanding many biological processes. One major challenge to understanding how these metabolites contribute to survival is that the enzymes that produce them are also unknown.\"The discovery of this biochemical recycling mechanism opens up exciting new avenues for future research, with the potential to dramatically accelerate the structural and functional annotation of unknown metabolites,\" says Chester Wrobel, a graduate student in the Schroeder lab and co-author of the perspective.

  "text": "Cancer-causing chlorinated paraffins are still used in a wide range of everyday products sold in North America, despite their known health harm and being banned in Canada for a decade, according to a new study in Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts. The researchers detected short-chain chlorinated paraffins in more than 85% of products tested, including headphones, plastic toys, clothing, personal care products, and indoor paints purchased in Canada.          \"We were astonished to find chlorinated paraffins in these types of products. Any parent would shudder at the thought of their baby chewing on a toy filled with cancer-causing chemicals,\" said co-author Hui Peng, an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the University of Toronto. \"We need to protect our children and the wider public from these harmful substances.\"Short-chain chlorinated paraffins cause cancer in laboratory rats and mice\u2014specifically targeting the liver, thyroid, and kidney. Though there are no human studies, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies them as possible human carcinogens. They also build up in our bodies, food webs, and environment.In 2012, the Government of Canada determined that \"all chlorinated paraffins are considered harmful with respect to human health,\" and banned their manufacture, new use, and import. In 2017, short-chain chlorinated paraffins were listed for elimination under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.Nonetheless, their total global production is huge\u2014more than 1 million tons per year\u2014and is increasing. These toxic chemicals are used in everyday products as flame retardants, plasticizers and lubricants. Until now, many of their specific uses in products were not known to scientists and the public.The highest concentrations of chlorinated paraffins in this study were detected in headphones and computer wires. The next highest concentrations were in toys and toy packaging. These uses can lead to human exposure through direct hand contact, mouthing of products by young children, and through contaminated dust making its way from hands to mouths.Since the tested products were largely manufactured for an international market, chlorinated paraffins are likely also found in similar products in the U.S., Europe, and beyond.\"Chlorinated paraffins are very harmful and widespread in everyday products, but they are flying under the radar,\" said co-author Arlene Blum, executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute. \"Many of their uses are unnecessary and should be stopped immediately for healthier people and ecosystems.\" More information:Steven Kutarna et al, Widespread presence of chlorinated paraffins in consumer products, Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts (2023).

The review was led by Prof. Junwang Tang, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London; and Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University.          \"Methane, with its huge reserve and wide application, has caused a strong greenhouse effect due to its high global warming potential nearly 30 times that of CO2. Catalytic oxidation of methane directly to CO2 offers a potential pathway to mitigate the adverse impact caused by methane emission,\" Tang says.\"Traditional thermocatalysis uses noble metal or transition metal and their oxides as catalysts to convert methane into CO2 and H2O with O2 at high temperatures. Alternatively, photocatalysis opens a green pathway to drive this reaction at ambient conditions in the presence of a photocatalyst and under light irradiation. Development of methane removal process via both thermocatalysis and photocatalysis hold[s] great importance in scientific research, and significant potential in large-scale applications as well.\"The recent catalytic methane oxidation processes are thus reviewed as follows:The development of thermocatalysts, especially Pd-based catalysts are summarized and comparedThe deactivation of thermocatalysts at high temperatures and in the presence of H2O, sulfur contents, etc., is discussedFundamental studies on the evolution of catalysts and surface chemistry during the catalytic process by advanced spectroscopies and microscopies are reviewedThe synthesis and performance of photocatalysts for methane oxidation are comparedThe underlying photophysics and surface chemistry processes in photocatalytic methane oxidation are discussed to guide future studies.Future work should focus on the development of efficient thermocatalysts work at lower temperatures or photocatalysts response to visible light.

  "text": "Neutrons from the Research Neutron Source Heinz Maier-Leibnitz (FRM II) can be used to explore the structure of biomolecules. The most recent success: the precise analysis of a promising vaccine against multidrug-resistant germs.          Bacteria which are resistant to all conventional antibiotics cause more than a million deaths each year. Consequently, researchers around the world are searching for new therapeutic approaches to combat these pathogens. Two years ago an international team in Grenoble identified an active ingredient suitable for the production of a vaccine against multidrug resistant bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The vaccine has in the meantime been successfully tested on mice.\"As with many new vaccines, in this case the active ingredient is embedded in liposomes. The exact characterization and understanding of these nanoscopic biomolecules is a key factor in the development and optimization of future vaccines,\" says Dr. Marco Maccarini, biophysicist at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). Together with experts at the TIMC laboratory of the Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes (UGA) and at the FRM II he has successfully analyzed the structure of the candidate vaccine against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.The vaccine consists of biomolecules with sizes in the order of 100 nanometers. These molecules consist mostly of lipids, substances similar to fats, which form small bubbles or liposomes because of their biochemical properties. These bubbles can in turn protect and transport the actual active ingredients. In the case of the vaccine against Pseudomonas aeruoginosa, this active ingredient is the protein OprF. \"In general, the active ingredient can dock to the liposome at various positions\u2014for example internally or externally,\" Maccarini explains. \"But it is best recognized by the immune system when it is integrated in the double lipid layer. Thus the structure of the biomolecule is decisive in the efficacy of a vaccine.\"Wanted: Non-destructive radiationSuch structural details are not visible to the naked eye. Optical microscopes do not have a high enough resolution for the investigation of liposomes. Although X-ray radiation has shorter wavelengths, it is unsuitable for structural analysis, since the radiation can damage the biomolecules under certain circumstances. \"But neutron beams are ideal: They only interact with atomic nuclei and thus cause no damage or structural changes. This way the samples can be investigated in their original condition,\" Maccarini says.The researcher found everything he needed to analyze the new candidate vaccine at the FRM II in Garching near Munich: a high neutron flux, a well-equipped laboratory and Dr. Aurel Radulescu, an expert in the measurement of small-angle scattering, a technology which can be used to investigate the nanometer-sized molecules in detail.Computer model represents structure of the vaccines\"In our case the challenge was using the diffractometer, which measures the scattering of the neutrons by the atomic nuclei, to distinguish between the proteins and the lipids in the sample,\" recalls Radulescu, who supervises the small-angle scattering diffractometer KWS-2 for the Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich (FZJ) in Garching. He adds that it took a trick to finally make this distinction work: \"We conducted the measurements with different combinations of solvents\u2014normal water and heavy water containing deuterium, mixed in various concentrations.\" Since neutrons \"see\" normal hydrogen and deuterium differently, the result was images of the sample with different contrasts that contained distinct information.For the analysis the research team developed a computer model that represents the structure of the candidate vaccine. \"This lets us not only render the two-layer structure of the lipids, but also lets us determine the average position and amount of the OprF active ingredient which is embedded between the two lipid layers.\"The work is published in the journal Langmuir. The new model can also be used to investigate the structure of new, liposome-based vaccines and to optimize their further development.

  "text": "Most antimicrobial wipes, which are predominantly made of synthetic fibers like polyester and polypropylene, are discarded after a single use and end up in landfills where they can stay for hundreds of years and become a source of environmental microplastic fiber pollution. But, researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) recently developed sustainable machine-washable antimicrobial wipes that can be used at least 30 times for cleaning hard and nonporous surfaces.          There has been a remarkable increase in the use of antimicrobial wipes due to the growing awareness of personal health protection. According to the Antimicrobial Wipes Market Outlook report, the worldwide antimicrobial wipes market is estimated to reach $21.6 billion by 2030.ARS researchers developed antimicrobial wipes by using raw cotton fiber that naturally produced silver nanoparticles inside the fiber in the presence of a silver precursor. These embedded silver nanoparticles can then release silver ions that act as antibacterial agents and kill harmful bacteria.\"Silver nanoparticles are one of the popular antimicrobial agents used for producing odor-inhibiting, anti-infective textile products and other personal health products,\" said Sunghyun Nam, research engineer at ARS's Cotton Chemistry and Utilization Research Unit in New Orleans.According to Nam, people will be able to clean surfaces by wetting the antimicrobial cloths with tap water and then wiping surfaces. In their research, scientists found that the wipes killed 99.9% of harmful bacteria S. aureus and P. aeruginosa on surfaces.The technology behind this research is advantageous in several aspects. It omits the conventional pretreatments of raw cotton fibers (such as scouring and bleaching), which consume a large number of chemicals and energy. It does not require any chemical agents except for a silver precursor.It also transforms cotton fibers themselves into antimicrobial agents rather than serving as a carrier of antimicrobial agents, which is what makes them reusable. The antimicrobial wipes are made from natural cotton fibers, rather than conventional petroleum-based synthetic fibers.To reuse the wipes, people can simply wash them in the laundry.\"We also found that the wipes still successfully killed pathogens even after being washed 30 times in the laundry,\" said Nam. \"The wipes regenerate their antimicrobial surface every time they are wet or washed because the embedded nanoparticles act as a reservoir of silver ions.\"Nam said that another important benefit of the embedding technology is to minimize the negative environmental impacts related to the leaching of nanoparticles.\"These wipes are designed to gradually give off low levels of silver ions from the nanoparticles embedded inside the cotton fiber over the full course of the time of use and deplete nanoparticles,\" said Nam.By developing reusable and washable antimicrobial wipes, Nam and her colleagues are aiming to find sustainable alternatives to reduce environmental waste from the disposal of single-use antimicrobial wipes.More details about the study and the technology behind the antimicrobial wipes are published in the journal Molecules.

In a study published in Environmental Science & Technology, a research team led by Prof. Zhu Yongguan and Li Gang from the Institute of Urban Environment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported the influence of humic substances, the major components of SOM, on the microbially mediated iron reduction and reoxidation processes, and established the pathway of \u00b7OH production in different SOM-containing system.The researchers used fulvic acid (FA), humic acid (HA), and humin (HM), components of humic substances operationally separated from soil, to evaluate the influence of SOM characteristics on iron redox processes. They found that high electron exchange capacity of FA and HA promoted the microbial iron reduction process, while HA with high electron donating capacity inhibited the yield of \u00b7OH.Using the scavengers of possible intermediate involved in \u00b7OH production, the researchers established different pathways for \u00b7OH production in SOM-containing system. They found that the one-electron transfer process dominated the \u00b7OH production in the FA-containing system, while both one- and two-electron transfer processes were present in HA- and HM-containing systems.Additionally, the researchers found that microbially mediated iron redox processes changed the properties of dissolved fractions of SOM, and the aromaticity of dissolved fraction of HA decreased due to its high reactivity with \u00b7OH.Based on the high-resolution transmission electron microscope and X-ray diffractometer, ferrous secondary minerals formed and SOM inhibited its transformation to higher stable and crystalline iron oxy(hydr)oxides.This work advances the understanding of SOM-involved iron redox processes and \u00b7OH production. The mechanisms revealed need to be considered when evaluating the effect of potentially produced \u00b7OH on pollutants degradation in redox fluctuating environments.

  "text": "After nearly a century of scientific inquiry, scientists have at last been able to characterize a key component in the substance responsible for giving countless living organisms their color.          In the study, published online today in the journal Nature Chemistry, an international team of researchers isolated a key molecule involved in the synthesis of melanin, a substance in the human body that produces pigmentation in the hair and skin and protects cells from being damaged by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The molecule they studied has many of the physical properties of eumelanin, a type of melanin that typically produces only black and brown pigments.Despite what researchers know about melanin, its chemical structure has remained elusive, said Bern Kohler, an Ohio Eminent Scholar and professor of chemistry and biochemistry at The Ohio State University, one of three senior authors on the study.\"Melanin is literally as plain as the nose on our face and we still don't know exactly what it's made of and how it works,\" said Kohler. \"It's thought to be a material made of large numbers of interacting components, and so what my collaborators and I are trying to get at is, what are melanin's underlying chemical units and what are the interactions that give rise to its properties?\"In the lab, melanin can be made naturally from just a few simple chemical substances that combine or react to form the pigmented material. Thanks to the efforts of Jean-Philip Lumb of McGill University and Lluis Blancafort of the University of Girona, the team was able to successfully synthesize and analyze one of its molecule-sized ingredients. They found that it had many of the same properties as the final product melanin, even without further transformation.\"Melanin is like a complex dish that you cook from just a few ingredients,\" said Kohler. \"Given that melanin granules in skin contain billions of atoms, it was surprising to see melanin-like properties emerge in a molecule containing only a few dozen atoms.\"As a spectroscopist\u2014or a scientist who investigates the interactions between matter and light\u2014Kohler said what he finds most remarkable is the brilliant green color of the melanin-like molecule, which is able to absorb deep red light.\"That's very hard for a small molecule to do,\" said Kohler. \"This is one of the smallest organic molecules known that can absorb long wavelengths all the way out into the infrared.\"Its unusual optical and magnetic properties make the melanin-mimicking molecule an attractive prospect for advancing bioelectronics research, a field that aims to connect electronics and living biological materials to fabricate new technologies or therapies for medical treatments, said Kohler.The study results also suggest that harnessing the power of melanin could be used to change the way humans harvest energy from our environment.\"Like solar energy conversion, part of our strategy for alternative energy is to absorb photons of light from across the solar spectrum,\" Kohler said. \"That's what eumelanin does, rather naturally.\"Future research will aim to study melanin-like properties in similar kinds of molecules. Such strides could offer greater accessibility to synthetic biomaterial alternatives, but in the short term, Kohler imagines the team's work uncovering a melanin-like molecule will inspire other labs to look more closely at how melanin's properties may emerge from other unexpectedly small molecular units.\"Our team is excited that further progress at understanding the structure of melanin can succeed by studying tailorable small molecules like the one we write about in this paper,\" he said. \"The chemistry is still tremendously complex, but interest should grow in small molecules as melanin models and the promise they hold for generating new, melanin-inspired materials.\" More information:Xueqing Wang et al, Indole-5,6-quinones display hallmark properties of eumelanin, Nature Chemistry (2023).

  "text": "Three engineers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have invented a fabric that concludes the 80-year quest to make a synthetic textile modeled on Polar bear fur. The results, published recently in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, are already being developed into commercially available products.          Polar bears live in some of the harshest conditions on earth, shrugging off Arctic temperatures as low as -50 Fahrenheit. While the bears have many adaptations that allow them to thrive when the temperature plummets, since the 1940s scientists have focused on one in particular: their fur. How, the scientific community has asked, does a polar bear's fur keep them warm?Typically, we think that the way to stay warm is to insulate ourselves from the weather. But there's another way: One of the major discoveries of the last few decades is that many polar animals actively use the sunlight to maintain their temperature, and polar bear fur is a well-known case in point.Scientists have known for decades that part of the bears' secret is their white fur. One might think that black fur would be better at absorbing heat, but it turns out that the polar bears' fur is extremely effective at transmitting solar radiation toward the bears' skin.\"But the fur is only half the equation,\" says the paper's senior author, Trisha L. Andrew, associate professor of chemistry and adjunct in chemical engineering at UMass Amherst. \"The other half is the polar bears' black skin.\"As Andrew explains it, polar bear fur is essentially a natural fiberoptic, conducting sunlight down to the bears' skin, which absorbs the light, heating the bear. But the fur is also exceptionally good at preventing the now-warmed skin from radiating out all that hard-won warmth. When the sun shines, it's like having a thick blanket that warms itself up, and then traps that warmth next to your skin.What Andrew and her team have done is to engineer a bilayer fabric whose top layer is composed of threads that, like polar bear fur, conduct visible light down to the lower layer, which is made of nylon and coated with a dark material called PEDOT. PEDOT, like the polar bears' skin, warms efficiently.So efficiently, in fact, that a jacket made of such material is 30% lighter than the same jacket made of cotton yet will keep you comfortable at temperatures 10 degrees Celsius colder than the cotton jacket could handle, as long as the sun is shining or a room is well lit.\"Space heating consumes huge amounts of energy that is mostly fossil fuel-derived,\" says Wesley Viola, the paper's lead author, who completed his Ph.D. in chemical engineering at UMass and is now at Andrew's startup, Soliyarn, LLC.\"While our textile really shines as outerwear on sunny days, the light-heat trapping structure works efficiently enough to imagine using existing indoor lighting to directly heat the body. By focusing energy resources on the 'personal climate' around the body, this approach could be far more sustainable than the status quo.\" More information:Wesley Viola et al, Solar Thermal Textiles for On-Body Radiative Energy Collection Inspired by Polar Animals, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2023).

  "text": "The chemical industry has played a significant role in the development of society, but its impact on the environment has become a growing concern. Green chemistry and chemical engineering have opened up possibilities for sustainability through the transformation of renewable feedstocks into environmentally friendly chemicals. However, the inert bonds in molecules such as CO2 and N2 present challenges to their activation and conversion.          Electrochemical conversion provides a promising carbon-neutral route to upgrading green chemical sources with inert bonds to chemicals and fuels under ambient conditions. Multicomponent electrocatalysts have advantages over monocomponent catalysts, such as better stability, increased activity, and expanded reaction processes.Multicomponent electrocatalysts offer a promising solution to the challenge of sustainability in the chemical industry. A group of researchers published their review on Industrial Chemistry & Materials.\"The chemical industry has played a crucial role in society's historical evolution, but it also presents emerging environmental concerns and skyrocketing CO2 emissions,\" said corresponding author Buxing Han, the member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a professor at Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICCAS).\"We were motivated to explore the possibilities of green chemistry and chemical engineering to transform renewable feedstocks, such as CO2 and NOx, into environmentally friendly chemicals, including syngas, hydrocarbons, oxygenates, and ammonia.\"\"However, these inert bonds, such as the C=O bond in CO2, pose challenges to their activation and conversion. We wanted to explore electrochemical conversion as a universal carbon-neutral route to efficiently upgrade green chemical sources with inert bonds to chemicals and fuels under ambient conditions harnessing clean energy,\" said co-corresponding author Prof. Xiaofu Sun, ICCAS.\"Multicomponent electrocatalysts offer advantages over monocomponent catalysts in terms of stability, activity, and reaction processes. So, we explored the use of multicomponent catalysts in the electroreduction of small molecules such as CO2, N2, and NOx. We developed three models for multicomponent catalysts: Type I, Type II, and Type III, which we discuss in our paper.\"Type I involves a non-catalytic active component that can activate or protect another catalytic component. Type II involves all catalytic components providing active intermediates for electrochemical conversion. Type III involves one component providing the substrate for the other through conversion or adsorption.\"Each of these models has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific reaction and catalyst. We explored the use of these models in our paper to show their effectiveness in the electroreduction of small molecules,\" Han said. \"And we also discussed future directions for applying multicomponent electrocatalysts in the industrial utilization of renewable chemical sources through highly efficient activation and conversion of inert bonds.\"What are the key challenges that need to be addressed in the development and utilization of multicomponent electrocatalysts for the activation and conversion of renewable chemical sources? \"One key challenge is improving the selectivity and efficiency of the electrocatalysts, as well as increasing their stability and activity,\" Sun said. \"Another challenge is understanding the fundamental mechanisms of the electroreduction reactions and how they are influenced by the multicomponent catalysts.\"\"More importantly, there is a need for further research and development to scale up and integrate these electrochemical processes into industrial applications.

  "text": "The research team of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT) has designed and developed a novel recycling process for producing biomass-derived chemicals by reusing the by-products of the target product. In this study, the research team demonstrated a self-sustaining process that minimizes the usage of external utilities in the chemical process by numerical simulations.          This achievement has significantly contributed to energy conservation by reusing by-products, which had been disposed of in the conventional process in the chemical process to ensure profitability. In addition, while previous processes were designed on a large scale, this study was designed with a biomass supply feasible in all regions.This is a completely different approach from conventional processes. With this achievement, we can significantly reduce petroleum usage in chemical processes to establish a recycling-oriented society in the future. In addition, for regional revitalization, it is expected to create a chemical industry for local production for local consumption using agricultural and forestry waste in mountainous regions.The results have been published in Chemical Engineering Research and Design .Biomass is the renewable carbon resource that can replace fossil resources in chemical production. Among the biomass-derived chemicals, levulinic acid (LA) is attracting attention as a platform chemical because it can be synthesized from cellulose, which makes up about 50% of woody biomass, and is a precursor for a wide range of substances from pharmaceuticals to bio-fuels.Conventional LA production processes from biomass are large-scale processes with an annual biomass supply of more than 120,000 tons, and had challenges in effectively utilizing all biomass resources.In response, this research team has developed a process that minimizes the supply of external utilities by reusing by-products produced during the production of LA from biomass as much as possible while still being able to supply all of the required energy from the combustion of by-products.Specifically, by reusing the by-product formic acid as a catalyst, using a chemical called furfural obtained from biomass as an extraction solvent to purify LA, and combusting the solid by-products, the total process energy was reduced and supplied by itself. Furthermore, it was found that the excess solid by-products could be effectively utilized for building materials and other purposes. We also found that using river water could provide all the cooling needed.The amount of river water is less than 0.12% of the minimum annual volume flow in the middle reaches of the Naka River in Tochigi Prefecture, located in a rural area of Japan.Regarding economics, the minimum selling price of LA produced by this process was $9.59 per kilogram, which was higher than the market price of $7.17 per kilogram. The reason is due to the fact that this process allows for thin profit margins to some extent, which is an advantage of large-scale processes, and also because no separation and purification of by-products are performed.The results of this research indicate that this process can be fully implemented in society for a locally produced and consumed chemical industry using agricultural and forestry waste in mountainous regions.

  "answer_squad": " 93.8%",
  "text": "Odorous gases, which are unpleasant and strongly irritating to the eyes, nose, and respiratory tract, are ubiquitous in facilities such as septic tanks, sewage systems, livestock farms, and waste disposal plants. These gases exert a negative impact on the human body as well as the surrounding environment, thus numerous ways have been developed to eliminate them. Typical odor removal methods use activated carbon as an adsorbent.          However, activated carbon has low recyclability, making it difficult to remove the sources of complex odorous gases for reuse.A research team led by Dr. Jiwon Lee and Youngtak Oh of the Sustainable Environment Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) announced that they developed an activated carbon manufacturing technology that dramatically improves the removal of four representative nitrogen-containing odorous compounds (NOCs) from air: ammonia, ethylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine.Not only did the research team improve the adsorption efficiency of activated carbon for removing odor substances, but they have also discovered the adsorption mechanism between adsorbents and odorous gases, making it possible to develop a wider variety of adsorbents for complex odor substances.The research team was able to precisely control the degree of surface oxidation to increase the adsorption efficiency of NOCs through an thermal annealing process after oxidizing the activated carbon with nitric acid. They found that the most oxidized heat-treated activated carbon could increase the removal efficiency of odor substances by up to 38 times compared to conventional activated carbon.For the first time, the researchers revealed that the oxygen atoms on the surface of oxidized activated carbon form strong hydrogen bonds with the amines in nitrogen-containing odor molecules. This finding reflects the principle of optimizing the adsorption effect of NOCs by increasing the degree of oxidation so that more hydrogen bonds can be formed with amines on the surface of activated carbon.Furthermore, the research team also demonstrated that unlike typical gas reactions, the interaction between the adsorbent and odor substances was primarily influenced by the number of hydrogen bonds, rather than proton affinity.                DFT calculation result and nitrogen-containing odorous compound selectivity of heat-dried activated carbo. Credit: Korea Institute of Science and Technology             Furthermore, thermally dried activated carbon(TDAC) was found to increase selectivity for trimethylamine by more than 13 times. This result represents a substantial improvement, as trimethylamine has the lowest adsorption efficiency among conventional NOCs.Trimethylamine, a designated odor substance regulated by law in Korea, is a typical source of odors in agriculture, landfills, and sewage and waste water treatment plants. In particular, the heat-dried activated carbon has an average recyclability of 93.8% for trimethylamine, showing high economic efficiency compared to the 63% recyclability of conventional activated carbon.\"By identifying the adsorption mechanism of odorous gases, we can develop materials that are specialized for removing specific gases, and heat-dried activated carbon, which undergoes an oxidation process, is relatively simple to produce and can be reused. Thus, it can be applied as a material for purification devices such as filters and masks,\" claimed Dr. Jiwon Lee of KIST.The study is published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.

  "text": "A team led by Prof. Zhang Kaiming from the University of Science and Technology (USTC) solved six conformations in the second-step self-splicing of Tetrahymena ribozyme using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), revealing the mechanism of group 1 introns coordinating self-splicing reactions. Their work was published in Nature Communications.          Group \u2160 introns are catalytic RNAs that can fold into tertiary structure with a active site with the help of metal ions, thereby promoting catalysis without proteins. However, the analysis of RNA structures faces enormous challenges due to the heterogeneity and flexibility of RNA. Since the discovery of Tetrahymena group I introns, numerous studies have elucidated its underlying catalytic mechanism, but the 3D structure of the full-length molecule and its rearrangements are yet to be obtained.To resolve the structural mechanism and the conformation changes in the self-splicing reactions, Prof. Zhang Kaiming's team first designed the substrates for the self-splicing reactions. After verifying that the substrates could complete the catalytic reactions and determining the optimal reaction conditions, the team captured structure snapshots of different conformations of Tetrahymena ribozyme during the self-spicing process using single-particle cryo-EM analysis.The first step starts from oligonucleotide substrate base pairing with the apoenzyme to form the P1-P1 extension duplex. After that, the tertiary interactions between P1 and three single-stranded segments within the catalytic core mediate docking of the duplex into the active site.Then the oligonucleotide product of the first step is released. The second step is the ligation reaction, where the 3'-exon substrates become docked in the ribozyme through tertiary contacts and metal coordination. Then the reaction goes gradually to an intermediate period, where metal coordination weakens and the tertiary interactions are lost.The exons are ligated in this period. Sequentially, the ribozyme relaxed and the product duplex undocks, reaching the substrate-free site. Finally, the duplex is unpaired and the product is released. Furthermore, the researchers also found structural evidences for the rearrangements of some hydrogen bonds and metal ions on active sites, which promote catalysis and coordinate self-splicing reactions.This research revealed the mechanism of self-splicing reaction on atomic level, proving the advantages of using cryo-EM to resolve RNA structure. With the increasing application of cryo-EM in the research of structurally heterogeneous molecules, it will become a vital tool in many other biological research like the folding of RNA systems.

  "text": "Newly synthesized organic molecules can be tuned to emit different colors depending on their molecular structures in crystal form.          Molecular switches are chemicals with molecular structures that can be shifted between two or more stable configurations in response to changes in their environment. They are of great interest in the development of molecular computers, molecular machines and drug delivery systems. Compounds with conformational isomers\u2014identical molecular formulas but different molecular structures\u2014can make very effective molecular switches.Researchers at Hokkaido University and Kyushu University have developed a technique to synthesize potential molecular switches from anthraquinodimethanes (AQDs), a group of overcrowded organic molecules. The study, led by Associate Professor Yusuke Ishigaki at Hokkaido University and Associate Professor Toshikazu Ono at Kyushu University, was published in the journal Materials Chemistry Frontiers.\"AQDs are a type of overcrowded ethylene, molecules with carbon-carbon double bonds surrounded by large chemical groups,\" explains Ono. \"They have two common isomers, the folded and twisted forms. They are especially interesting as molecular switches, as their sterically hindered double bond can provide isomers absorbing and emitting different wavelengths of light.\"                The folded and twisted isomers absorb different wavelengths of light. Credit: Materials Chemistry Frontiers (2023).  DOI: 10.1039/D2QM01199A             AQDs generally adopt the most stable folded or twisted form, making it difficult to isolate pure samples of any other isomer to study its properties. The researchers surmounted this obstacle by designing flexible AQD derivatives that can more easily and stably form different isomers.The synthesized derivatives were not only able to stably form twisted and folded isomers, but also other isomeric forms, when recrystallized in different solvents. The researchers performed detailed analysis of the derivatives to fully understand their properties.In a crystalline state, each of these isomers absorbs and emits distinct frequencies of light, which is due to the differences in the distribution of electrons in the isomer molecules. Interestingly, the light absorption and emission changed when the crystals were ground into amorphous solid, and following treatment with appropriate solvents can produce original or other crystals with a variety of colors.                    The methyl derivative of the new compound has four different isomers, with different crystal structures each. Credit: Materials Chemistry Frontiers (2023).

  "text": "Using solar energy and photocatalysts to convert CO2 into high value-added chemicals can simultaneously alleviate the greenhouse effect and energy crisis. Single atom cocatalysts decoration has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to improve the CO2 photocatalytic reduction efficiency.          Unfortunately, when unraveling the mechanism behind performance promotion, most studies mainly focus on clarifying the superior physicochemical and photoelectrical properties of SACs in comparison with the substrate. The critical role of the sing-atomic state distinguished from those oxide and elemental states was often neglected and remains a mystery.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Zhongbiao Wu and Haiqiang Wang from Zhejiang University, China, comprehensively investigated the effect of Pd chemical states on CO2 photocatalytic reduction of g-C3N4 (CN) under visible light irradiation, especially the critical role of Pd-SA in boosting CH4 production. The results were published in the Chinese Journal of Catalysis.Performance tests showed Pd species decoration improved the CH4 production of CN, with Pd/CN-SA exhibiting the optimum yields (2.25 \u03bcmol g-1), markedly higher than that of PdOx/CN (1.08 \u03bcmol g-1) and Pd/CN-NP (0.44 \u03bcmol g-1). After comprehensive mechanism analysis with various characterization techniques, in-situ FTIR spectra and DFT calculations, it was found that the conducive activation of CO2, negative conduction band potentials, and excellent \u2022H utilization efficiency, collaboratively contributed to the superior CO2 reduction performance of Pd/CN-SA, especially in the remarkably boosted CH4 production.In addition, despite the larger electron density of Pd/CN-NP and PdOx/CN, the moderate reduction ability of their photogenerated electrons restricted the further reduction of adsorbed CO2 species and CO intermediate, limiting the enhancement of CO2 reduction activity. Furthermore, the CH4 evolutions of Pd/CN-NP and PdOx/CN were also limited by the poor \u2022H supply and inferior \u2022H utilization efficiency, respectively.The new insights may advance the understanding of CO2 reduction process and inspire the design of efficient photocatalysts for CO2 photocatalytic conversion.

  "text": "The traditionally cumbersome yet widely-used Birch reduction can now be carried out in a mere minute in air using an optimized mechanochemical approach.          The Birch reduction is a reaction commonly used to make medicines and bioactive compounds, but the laborious process typically requires that chemists handle liquid ammonia, use cryogenic temperatures, and carry out time-consuming steps.Researchers at the Institute for Chemical Reaction Design and Discovery (WPI-ICReDD) in Hokkaido University have developed a simplified method for performing the Birch reduction that avoids the use of ammonia, can be done at room temperature and in ambient air, and is 20\u2013150 times faster than conventional methods. Their findings are published in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition.A number of lithium-based methods for performing the Birch reduction in solution have been previously developed, but since lithium reacts with both air and water, these processes still required complicated reaction setups with an inert atmosphere or dehydrated conditions. Researchers in this study saw an opportunity to avoid these issues by switching from a solution-based method to a solvent-less method using a ball mill, in which reactants are shaken rapidly in a small metal jar along with a metal ball that smashes the solid reactants together.\"In previous studies, we found that using a ball mill for reactions of metals such as magnesium and calcium with organic compounds improved the reaction rate and greatly simplified the process,\" said co-author Associate Professor Koji Kubota. \"Based on this, we wondered if we could develop a more straight-forward Birch reduction process by performing reactions of lithium metal with aromatic compounds in a ball mill.\"                Overview of the simplified protocol for the Birch reduction using a ball mill. Credit: Angewandte Chemie International Edition (2023).  DOI: 10.1002/anie.202217723             The key to this strategy is that the mechanical impact from the ball breaks through the surface layer on the lithium that reacted with the air, exposing the pure lithium underneath to the other reactants and enabling the Birch reduction to proceed. This approach can be carried out in ambient air and at room temperature, making for a much easier process.Researchers demonstrated the versatility of the process, successfully testing it with a wide variety of organic compounds, including pharmaceutical intermediates and other bioactive molecules. In most cases, the Birch reduction was completed in an astonishingly quick one minute.The process was successfully scaled up to larger gram-scale batches, and the team believes this technique could enable the simplified synthesis of a wide variety of molecules, while also marking an important advance in mechanochemistry.\"The Birch reduction is used extensively in drug discovery and various chemical industries, and our research has made significant advancements, resulting in a much simpler and more eco-friendly Birch reduction process,\" commented Professor Hajime Ito, who led the study. \"We expect this breakthrough to accelerate drug discovery and various other areas of chemical research.\" More information:Yunpeng Gao et al, Mechanochemical Approach for Air\u2010Tolerant and Extremely Fast Lithium\u2010Based Birch Reductions in Minutes, Angewandte Chemie International Edition (2023).

  "text": "Researchers at Binghamton University led research partnering with the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN)\u2014a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory\u2014to get a better look at how peroxides on the surface of copper oxide promote the oxidation of hydrogen but inhibit the oxidation of carbon monoxide, allowing them to steer oxidation reactions. They were able to observe these quick changes with two complimentary spectroscopy methods that have not been used in this way. The results of this work have been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).          \"Copper is one of the most studied and relevant surfaces, both in catalysis and in corrosion science,\" explained Anibal Boscoboinik, materials scientist at CFN. \"So many mechanical parts that are used in industry are made of copper, so trying to understand this element of the corrosion processes is very important.\"\"I've always liked looking at copper systems,\" said Ashley Head also a materials scientist at CFN. \"They have such interesting properties and reactions, some of which are really striking.\"Gaining a better understanding of oxide catalysts gives researchers more control of the chemical reactions they produce, including solutions for clean energy. Copper, for example, can catalytically form and convert methanol into valuable fuels, so being able to control the amount of oxygen and number of electrons on copper is a key step to efficient chemical reactions.Peroxide as a proxyPeroxides are chemical compounds that contain two oxygen atoms linked by shared electrons. The bond in peroxides is fairly weak, allowing other chemicals to alter its structure, which makes them very reactive. In this experiment, scientists were able to alter the redox steps of catalytic oxidation reactions on an oxidized copper surface (CuO) by identifying the makeup of peroxide species formed with different gases: O2 (oxygen), H2 (hydrogen), and CO (carbon monoxide).Redox is a combination of reduction and oxidation. In this process, the oxidizing agent gains an electron and the reducing agent loses an electron. When comparing these different peroxide species and how these steps played out, researchers found that a surface layer of peroxide significantly enhanced CuO reducibility in favor of H2 oxidation. They also found that, on the other hand, it acted as an inhibitor to suppress CuO reduction against CO (carbon monoxide) oxidation. They found that this opposite effect of the peroxide on the two oxidation reactions stems from the modification of the surface sites where the reaction takes place.By finding these bonding sites and learning how they promote or inhibit oxidation, scientists can use these gases to gain more control of how these reactions play out. In order to tune these reactions though, scientists had to get a clear look at what was happening.                Binding energy and location of peroxide (OO) formation on Copper Oxide (CuO). Credit: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)             The right tools for the jobStudying this reaction in situ was important to the team, since peroxides are very reactive and these changes happen fast. Without the right tools or environment, it's hard to catch such a limited moment on the surface.Peroxide species on copper surfaces were never observed using in-situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy in the past. With this technique, researchers use infrared radiation to get a better understanding of a material's chemical properties by looking at the way the radiation is absorbed or reflected under reaction conditions. In this experiment, scientists were able to differentiate \"species\" of peroxide, with very slight variations in the oxygen they were carrying, which would have otherwise been very hard to identify on a metal oxide surface.\"I got really excited when I was looking up the infrared spectra of these peroxide species on a surface and seeing that there weren't many publications. It was exciting that we could see these differences using a technique that's not widely applied to these kind of species,\" recalled Head.IR spectroscopy on its own wasn't enough to be sure though, which is why the team also used another spectroscopy technique called ambient pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). XPS uses lower energy X-rays to kick electrons out of the sample. The energy of these electrons gives scientists clues about the chemical properties of atoms in the sample. Having both techniques available through the CFN User Program was key to making this research possible.\"One of the things that we pride ourselves in is the instruments that we have and modified here,\" said Boscoboinik. \"Our instruments are connected, so users can move the sample in a controlled environment between these two techniques and study them in situ to get complementary information. In most other circumstances, a user would have to take the sample out to go to a different instrument, and that change of environment could alter its surface.\"\"A nice feature of CFN lies not only in its state-of-the-art facilities for science, but also the opportunities it provides to train young researchers,\" said Guangwen Zhou professor at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science's Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Materials Science program at Binghamton University. \"Each of the students involved have benefited from extensive, hands-on experience in the microscopy and spectroscopy tools available at CFN.\"This work was accomplished with the contributions of four Ph.D. students in Zhou's group: Yaguang Zhu and Jianyu Wang, the first co-authors of this paper, and Shyam Patel and Chaoran Li. All of these students are early in their career, having just earned their PhDs in 2022.Future findingsThe results of this study may apply to other types of reactions and other catalysts besides copper. These findings and the processes and techniques that led scientists there could find their ways into related research. Metal oxides are widely used as catalysts themselves or components in catalysts. Tuning peroxide formation on other oxides could be a way to block or enhance surface reactions during other catalytic processes.\"I'm involved in some other projects related to copper and copper oxides, including transforming carbon dioxide to methanol to use as a fuel for clean energy,\" said Head. \"Looking at these peroxides on the same surface that I use has the potential to make an impact on other projects using copper and other metal oxides.\" More information:Yaguang Zhu et al, Tuning the surface reactivity of oxides by peroxide species, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis?",
  "answer_squad": " THC",
  "text": "University of Toronto researchers are investigating exposure to second-hand\u2014and even third-hand\u2014marijuana smoke in homes, including the THC that can collect on floors and surfaces.          The researchers, in Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering, have published a new study that models how THC\u2014the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis\u2014behaves and transforms once it is released in an indoor environment. The study is published in the journal Environmental Science: Atmospheres.The model enables researchers to explore mitigation strategies that could reduce involuntary exposure levels.\"We began our research on tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive part of cannabis that causes intoxication, because when we looked at second- and third-hand smoke, we started to see how much involuntary exposure happens,\" says Amirashkan Askari, a Ph.D. candidate in department of chemical engineering and applied chemistry.Askari co-authored the study with U of T Engineering Associate Professor Arthur Chan and Frank Wania, a professor in the department of physical and environmental sciences at U of T Scarborough.Between April 2021 and March 2022, Canadians spent $4 billion on regulated, adult-use cannabis, according to Statistics Canada. Dried cannabis accounted for 71.1 percent of sales, indicating that smoking is the most popular method of consumption.\"Any type of smoking, whether it is tobacco or cannabis, leaves behind a suite of pollutants that can remain in homes,\" says Chan. \"We now have sufficient chemical knowledge about THC to model its behavior in a typical indoor environment.\"Moreover, involuntary THC exposure can continue long after smoking has ceased. This is due to THC's large and complex chemical structure, which has a strong tendency to stick to surfaces and create third-hand exposure,\" says Askari.\"There are a lot of surfaces indoors\u2014tables, chairs and floors. When you calculate the ratio of surfaces to volume, it is quite elevated compared to the outdoors,\" he says. \"So, when a pollutant is emitted, it always has the chance to migrate from air to surfaces.\"Involuntary exposure to pollutants starts to become more important when we consider infants and children who reside in homes where this smoking takes place. Children tend to touch surfaces more than adults as they crawl or play; they are also known to frequently put their hands or objects in their mouth.\"      Askari used a time-dependent indoor mass-balance model to forecast the level of human exposure to THC. The study also examined the effectiveness of mitigating strategies\u2014from air purifiers to surface cleaners\u2014in reducing second- and third-hand exposure from marijuana smoke.The model was run for one simulated year under the assumption that THC from single-stream smoke (the lighted end) of a burning cannabis cigarette was emitted into the indoor air for one hour daily.By modeling the exposure level of an adult and a toddler (who were distinguished by body weight) Askari predicted that residents of all ages who are present during smoking sessions are vulnerable to high levels of involuntary second-hand THC.The exposure analysis also found that carpet and flooring materials were significant reservoirs of THC that migrated from air to surface. Since younger children are prone to object mouthing\u2014a common part of infant and toddler development\u2014this makes them especially sensitive to THC from third-hand exposure. These results, the study concludes, highlight the importance of preventing children from accessing spaces where cannabis smoking takes place, both during and after smoking.\"When it comes to improving indoor air quality, the best way to degrade air pollutants is to shut down the source,\" says Askari. \"But if our aim is to suppress it, we found the most effective measures were strategies that target the air particles directly. So, if you have an air purifier unit that filters particulate matter from the air, that will reduce that exposure significantly.\"While the researchers' initial study used computer simulation, the second phase of this cannabis and indoor air pollution research involves experiments in collaboration with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH).\"We had volunteers come in and either smoke or vape cannabis,\" says Askari. \"We measured the composition of air in real time\u2014while they were consuming the cannabis\u2014so we could see what happens to the air quality. We also did comparisons between smoking and vaping.\"The results from this second study have not been published, but the team hopes this research will help individuals and policymakers better understand how this source of indoor air pollution impacts the health of communities.\"We hope that people will start paying more attention to indoor air quality, not just during these high-emitting activities, but also long after they are over,\" Chan says. \"Keeping our homes well-ventilated is very effective at lowering our exposures, even if it is just for a brief period of time during and after smoking.\" More information:Amirashkan Askari et al, Modeling the fate and involuntary exposure to tetrahydrocannabinol emitted from indoor cannabis smoking, Environmental Science: Atmospheres (2023).

  "answer_squad": " DFNS/TiO2-Cu10",
  "text": "The heavy use of fossil fuels for driving industrial processes and human activities has resulted in increasingly excessive emissions of anthropogenic CO2 into our atmosphere, surpassing the 400 ppm level. This exceedingly high concentration of atmospheric CO2 has led to a series of negative consequences for our planet's climate system. However, CO2 can be a strategic carbon resource for synthesizing valued chemicals and fuels.          There have been numerous reports of noble metal catalysts, but their application was limited due to their moderate catalytic performance and high cost. In the non-noble metal catalyst family, Cu-based catalysts are among the most versatile, with good potential in many industrial processes. Unfortunately, the low Tammann temperature of copper and the resulting surface migration causes nanoparticles to sinter during the reaction, limiting their activity and long-term stability.In this work, a team of researchers led by Prof. Vivek Polshettiwar at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, asked the question, how to improve the catalytic activity and stability of Cu-catalyst using the concept of strong metal support interactions (SMSI) and defect sites cooperativity?They reported a catalyst with active copper sites loaded on titanium oxide-coated dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS/TiO2-Cu) for CO2 to CO conversion. The fibrous morphology and high surface area of DFNS/TiO2 allowed better dispersion and high loading of Cu NPs active sites.This catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance for CO2 reduction with CO productivity of 5350 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121 (i.e., 53506 mmol gCu\u22121 h\u22121), superior to all copper-based thermal catalysts. Notably, DFNS/TiO2-Cu10 showed 99.8% selectivity towards CO and was stable for at least 200 hours. The defect-controlled strong metal-support interactions between Cu and TiO2 kept the copper nanoparticles firmly anchored on the surface of the support and imparted excellent catalyst stability.The EELS studies, in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, density functional theory calculations, and long-term stability indicated that there was a strong interaction between copper sites and the Ti3+ sites,which ensured good stability and dispersion of the active copper sites. In-situ studies provided insights into the role of defect sites (Ti3+ and O-vacancies) in tuning SMSI.In-situ time-resolved Fourier transform infrared indicated that CO2 did not directly dissociate to form CO, while the in-situ Raman and in-situ UV-DRS study demonstrated that the intensity of the oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ centers gradually decreased after introducing CO2 gas into the reactor chamber and progressively increased when exposed to hydrogen. This indicated that CO2 to CO conversion followed a redox pathway assisted by hydrogen.Excellent catalytic performance of DFNS/TiO2-Cu and in-situ mechanistic studies indicated the potential of defects in tuning the strong metal-support interactions. This approach may lead to the design of catalytic systems using various active sites and defective supports.The paper is published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

  "answer_race": " To inform readers of cocoa beans' contamination.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the team that worked on the cocoa beans?",
  "answer_squad": " BESSY II",
  "text": "Cocoa beans can absorb toxic heavy metals such as cadmium from the soil. Some cultivation areas, especially in South America, are polluted with these heavy metals, in some cases considerably. In combining different X-ray fluorescence techniques, a team at BESSY II has now been able to non-invasively measure for the first time where cadmium accumulates exactly in cocoa beans: Mainly in the shell.          The work is published in the journal Analytical Chemistry, and further investigations show that the processing of the cocoa beans can have a great influence on the concentration of heavy metals.People have been harvesting the beans of the cocoa bush for at least 5,000 years. They have learned to ferment, roast, grind and process the beans with sugar and fat to make delicious chocolates. Today, around 5 million tons of beans are on the market every year, coming from only a few growing areas in tropical regions.Chocolate is considered a soul food: amino acids such as tryptophan brighten the mood. Cocoa beans also contain anti-inflammatory compounds and valuable trace elements. However, cocoa plants also absorb toxic heavy metals if the soils are polluted, for example by mining, which can gradually poison groundwater and soils.An important question is, where exactly the heavy metals accumulate in the bean, whether rather in the shell or rather in the endosperm inside the bean. From the harvest to the raw material for chocolate, the beans undergo many steps of different treatments, which could possibly reduce the contamination. And ideally the treatment could be optimized in order to make sure that the heavy metals are reduced but the desirable trace elements are retained.Mapping the beans at BESSY IIA team led by Dr. Ioanna Mantouvalou (HZB) and Dr. Claudia Keil (TU Berlin/Toxicology) has now combined various imaging methods at the BAMline of BESSY II to precisely map the heavy metal concentrations in cocoa beans.They examined cocoa samples from a cultivation region in Colombia, which were contaminated with an average of 4.2 mg/kg cadmium. This is well above the European limits of 0.1-0.8 mg cadmium/kg in cocoa products.                Element distribution on a virtual section of a fermented cocoa bean using X-ray fluorescence CT. It is clearly visible that cadmium (Cd) is mainly found in the shell. Credit: HZB             The team worked with three different X-ray fluorescence techniques to examine the cocoa beans. Among other things, they developed a new analytical method for absorption correction when imaging with an X-ray color camera.\"There has been little understanding of how cadmium migrates from the soil through roots into the plant and where the element accumulates in the beans. Especially because it was not possible to precisely localize the cadmium content non-invasively,\" says Mantouvalou. Ph.D. students Frank F\u00f6rste (TU Berlin) and Leona Bauer (TU Berlin and HZB) carried out the experiments.Cadmium is particularly difficult to detect, explains Mantouvalou. This is because the cadmium signal, which produces the excitation of the outer electrons, lies exactly below the much stronger fluorescence signal of the element potassium, which occurs in higher concentrations in cocoa.\"We therefore excite a deeper electron shell of the cadmium atom, which is only possible with hard X-rays at the BAMLine,\" says Frank F\u00f6rste. \"This enabled us to map the cross-sections of cocoa beans with high resolution, and show that cadmium predominantly accumulates in the outer shell,\" says Leona Bauer.They also discovered interesting differences between beans before and after the roasting process. \"We were able to prove that roasting changes the element distribution in the beans,\" says Mantouvalou. The combination of the different experimental methods allows researchers for the first time to precisely measure the accumulation of cadmium. Further investigations could systematically explore how to improve the processing steps in order to minimize the exposure.

  "text": "JILA researchers have upgraded a breathalyzer based on Nobel Prize-winning frequency-comb technology and combined it with machine learning to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection with excellent accuracy in 170 volunteer subjects. Their achievement represents the first real-world test of the technology's capability to diagnose disease in exhaled human breath.          Their study on this topic was published in the Journal of Breath Research.Frequency comb technology has the potential to non-invasively diagnose more health conditions than other breath analysis techniques, while also being faster and potentially more accurate than some other medical tests. Frequency combs act as rulers for precisely measuring different colors of light, including the infrared light absorbed by biomolecules in a person's breath.Human breath contains more than 1,000 different trace molecules, many of which are correlated with specific health conditions. JILA's frequency comb breathalyzer identifies chemical signatures of molecules based on exact colors and amounts of infrared light absorbed by a sample of exhaled breath.Back in 2008, Jun Ye and colleagues at JILA demonstrated the world's first frequency comb breathalyzer, which measured the absorption of light in the near-infrared part of the optical spectrum. In 2021 they achieved a thousandfold improvement in detection sensitivity by extending the technique to the mid-infrared spectral region, where molecules absorb light much more strongly. This enables some breath molecules to be identified at the parts-per-trillion level where those with the lowest concentrations tend to be present.Credit: National Institute of Standards and TechnologyThe added benefit to this study was the use of machine learning. Machine learning\u2014a form of artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014processes and analyzes a massive, complex m\u00e9lange of data from all the breath samples as measured by 14,836 comb \"teeth,\" each representing a different color or frequency to create a predictive model to diagnose disease.\"Molecules increase or decrease in their concentrations when associated with specific health conditions. Machine learning analyzes this information, identifies patterns and develops reliable criteria we can use to predict a diagnosis,\" said Qizhong Liang, a graduate student in the Jun Ye group, who is lead author of a new paper presenting the findings.JILA is jointly operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder). The research was conducted on breath samples collected from 170 CU Boulder students and staff from May 2021 to January 2022. Approximately half of the volunteers tested positive for COVID-19 with standard PCR tests. The other half of the subjects tested negative. The young study group had a median age of 23 years old, and all were above 18 years old. The general campus population was more than 90% vaccinated.Credit: National Institute of Standards and Technology\"I do think that this comb technique is superior to anything out there,\" NIST/JILA Fellow Jun Ye said. \"The basic point is not just the detection sensitivity, but the fact that we can generate a far greater amount of data, or breath markers, really establishing a whole new field of 'comb breathomics' with the help of AI. With a database, we can then use it to search and study many other physiological conditions for human beings and to help advance the future of healthcare.\"The JILA comb breathalyzer method demonstrated excellent accuracy for detecting COVID by using machine learning algorithms on absorption patterns to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. H2O (water), HDO (semi-heavy water), H2CO (formaldehyde), NH3 (ammonia), CH3OH (methanol), and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) were identified as discriminating molecules for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The team measured the accuracy of their results by creating a data graph comparing their predictions of COVID-19 against the PCR test results (which, it should be noted, have high but not perfect accuracy). On the graph, they computed a quantity known as the \"area under the curve\" (AUC). An AUC of 1, for example, would be expected for perfectly discriminating between ambient air and exhaled breath. An AUC of 0.5 would be expected for making random guesses on whether the individuals were born on odd or even months. The researchers measured an AUC of 0.849 for their COVID-19 predictions. An AUC of 0.8 or greater for medical diagnostic data is considered \"excellent\" accuracy.Credit: National Institute of Standards and TechnologyIn the future, the researchers could further increase the accuracy by expanding the spectral coverage, analyzing the patterns with more powerful AI techniques, and measuring and analyzing additional molecules, which could include the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself. Researchers would need to build a database of the specific IR colors absorbed by the virus (its spectral \"fingerprint\") to potentially measure viral concentrations in the breath.The researchers also identified significant differences in breath samples based on tobacco use and a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms such as lactose intolerance. This suggests broader capability of the technique for diagnosing different sets of diseases.The researchers plan further studies to try to diagnose other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the third-leading cause of death worldwide according to the World Health Organization. The researchers have also recently boosted the comb breathalyzer's diagnostic power by expanding the spectral coverage to detect additional molecules. They plan to employ additional AI approaches such as deep learning to improve its disease-detection abilities. Efforts are already under way to miniaturize and simplify the technology to make it portable and easy to use in hospitals and other care settings.Credit: National Institute of Standards and TechnologyYe said there is interest from the medical community in seeing the comb breathalyzer developed further and commercialized. Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be needed before the technology could be used in medical settings.The most prevalent analytical technique in breath research now is gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry, which can detect hundreds of exhaled molecules but works slowly, typically requiring tens of minutes. Its use of chemical process also unavoidably alters breath components and presents analytical challenges to identify breath profiles accurately. Frequency comb technology measures breath molecules in a non-destructive and real time manner and can promote a more accurate and repeatable determination of exhaled breath contents.

  "text": "Renewable-energy-powered electrochemical CO or CO2 reduction reactions (CO(2)RR) is one of the most promising strategies to upgrade CO2 to valuable products. A key question and bone of contention is whether any surface or subsurface oxygen remains on the electrocatalysts under the reducing CO(2)RR conditions, and if so, whether that oxygen play any role in facilitating the reaction.       Thermodynamically, the oxides are expected to be reduced to the metallic form under the CO(2)RR conditions according to the Pourbaix diagram. However, multiple experimental studies report evidence for oxygen-containing species on electrocatalysts at CO(2)RR conditions, which could be attributed either to the difference in reaction and characterization conditions, or to the distinct thermodynamic stabilities of surface and bulk oxides.This mini-review led by Prof. Bingjun Xu (College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University) summarizes recent literature on this topic and discusses the possible sources of oxygen-containing species at or near the electrode-electrolyte interfaces under CO(2)RR conditions.Potential (sub)surface oxygen-containing species are grouped into three main categories based on the conditions at which they are introduced: (1) via the exposure to ambient air; (2) via the pretreatment of the catalyst; and (3) with the assistance of additional oxygen sources via in-situ redox reactions.Potential impact of oxygen-containing species on the activity and product distribution in the CO(2)RR, and the perspectives on future efforts to reveal the identity and role of oxygen-containing species in the CO(2)RR are also discussed.The findings are published in the journal Science China Chemistry.

  "text": "New research from a team of scientists at the Cornell University Center for Bright Beams has made significant strides in developing new techniques to guide the growth of materials used in next-generation particle accelerators.          The study, published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry C, reveals the potential for greater control over the growth of superconducting Nb3Sn films, which could significantly reduce the cost and size of cryogenic infrastructure required for superconducting technology.Superconducting accelerator facilities, such as those used for X-ray free-electron laser radiation, rely on niobium superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities to generate high-energy beams. However, the associated cryogenic infrastructure, energy consumption, and operating costs of niobium SRF cavities limit access to this technology.To address this issue, researchers have been working to identify superconducting materials that can operate at temperatures higher than 2 Kelvin with comparable quality factors to niobium (Nb) SRF cavities. One of the most promising materials is triniobium tin (Nb3Sn), an alloy with an operating temperature of 18 Kelvin, thus reducing the need for expensive cryogenic infrastructure.Despite theoretical and experimental advancements in the performance of Nb3Sn-coated cavities, there is still a need for a thorough understanding of how to grow higher quality Nb3Sn alloy films.\"Nb3Sn cavities are going to be the accelerators of the future,\" says Ritchie Patterson, the Helen T. Edwards Professor of Physics in the College of Arts and Sciences and director of the Center for Bright Beams. \"Advancing this science is only made possible through diverse collaborations\u2014an important focus at the heart of CBB. The expertise and close collaborations between all of our partner institutions are driving this research into the future.\"                The metal deposition chamber. Credit: Cornell University             This new CBB research, conducted by experimental materials chemists at the University of Chicago coupled with theoretical physicists at the University of Florida, delivers the first atomic-scale images of Sn on oxidized niobium, depicting the early stages of Nb3Sn formation. This visualization of Sn adsorption and diffusion on oxidized niobium is an essential advancement in creating a mechanistic formula for optimizing the fabrication of next generation accelerator cavities.      \"The quality and accelerating performance of Nb3Sn depends on many convoluted variables at play during the growth procedure,\" says Sarah Willson, CBB graduate student at the University of Chicago and co-lead author of the paper along with postdoctoral scholar Rachael Farber. \"We are aiming to look at the initial steps of a complicated growth process and isolate certain variables in a controlled setting.\" Their atomic-level growth experiments are supported by quantum theory from graduate student Ajinkya Hire.As Nb3Sn accelerator cavities are prepared, scientists aim to reduce impurities and contaminants from the niobium cavity to achieve a cleaner and more uniform surface. The cavity is then heated to high temperatures in the presence of an Sn vapor. This causes the Sn to diffuse into the Nb layer, forming Nb3Sn. As careful measures are taken to grow a pristine Nb3Sn film, looking closely across the cavity reveals a highly disordered, rough, polycrystalline surface\u2014not the consistent single-crystal surface ideal for a highly controlled experiment.Willson explains that in order to conduct this experiment, they recreate, in a way, the real-world process of cavity-making, but further surpass the temperature demands needed\u2014heating the materials to 1630 degrees Celsius, and creating an atomically-flat niobium oxide surface to showcase the interactions of Sn, Nb, and O at the atomic level.Observations of metal oxides are routinely performed using scanning tunneling microscopy, STM, revealing information at the atomic scale. However, the specific setup for studying Nb3Sn growth with STM is not readily available. So, Willson and Farber created one.They designed and built a custom metal deposition chamber to deposit the Sn on the niobium surface. This technique recreates the real-world environment in which accelerator cavities are developed\u2014with the ability to prevent surface contamination\u2014while allowing researchers to study the deposition using STM.

Many chemists are interested in these types of interfacial metallic growth challenges that are encountered by engineers and physicists. This collaboration facilitated extensive interdisciplinary communication that has made conducting a study like this more comfortable and efficient.\" More information:Sarah A.

  "text": "A steric hindrance regulation strategy was developed to predictably synthesize broadband white-light-emitting perovskites. This study was led by Prof. Jun Xing (College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Qingdao University of Science & Technology) and Prof. Weigao Xu (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University).       The authors reveal the effect of molecular configuration on the structural distortion of perovskites and pioneer a steric hindrance regulation strategy to predictably synthesize broadband white-light-emitting perovskites. Typically, the spacing molecules containing C-C(-NH2)-C group were applied to synthesize 2D perovskites, which bring large steric hindrance in the in-plane orientation and induce structural distortion.The degree of structural distortion in the perovskite could be regulated by controlling the C-C(-NH2)-C bond angle of the molecule, which determines the free excitons self-trapping. The synthesized perovskites exhibit tunable broadband emission covering from 400 to 800 nm, and the bigger molecular steric hindrance induces the larger structural distortion and the higher rate of excitons self-trapping, which therefore results in cool- to warm-white-light.According to this strategy, the functional molecules can be extended to secondary and tertiary amines with group C-NHx-C, and 40 kinds of perovskites with broadband emission were successfully fabricated. This work opens a general way to the directed synthesis of abundant white-light-emitting perovskites and uncovers the molecular steric hindrance-structural distortion-STEs relationship in the perovskites.The paper is published in the journal Science China Chemistry.

  "answer_squad": " Chitosan",
  "text": "An international interdisciplinary team of researchers from India, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand has successfully developed a method of using chitosan from terrestrial insects to manufacture eco\u2010friendly polymer composite parts using the 3D printing method.          3D printing is a form of additive manufacturing technology that is becoming increasingly popular in recent times due to its ability to produce complex shapes and geometries that were difficult to achieve using traditional manufacturing techniques. As a result, the demand for raw material for 3D printing is on the rise. It is crucial to ensure responsible usage of raw materials for 3D printing to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12, i.e., promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns.Chitosan is a natural biopolymer that is derived from chitin, a polysaccharide found in the exoskeletons of arthropods such as insects, as well as in sea creatures such in the shells of crabs. Terrestrial insects are a potential source of chitosan due to their abundance, accessibility, and relatively high chitin content in their exoskeletons. There are several potential benefits to extracting chitosan from terrestrial insects, including sustainable and eco-friendly production.Insects are a sustainable source of chitosan, as they can be easily farmed and harvested in large quantities without contributing to environmental pollution. In contrast, traditional sources of chitosan such as shrimp and crab shells can be unsustainable and have negative environmental impacts. However, how best to use chitin and chitosan materials derive from terrestrial insects remains debatable.This study has investigated the feasibility of developing an environmentally friendly composite material using 3D printing technology. The study found that the addition of chitin and chitosan, derived from terrestrial insects, to the PLA matrix led to a decrease in strength and stiffness, which worsened with increasing concentrations of chitin and chitosan. The composite material with 0.5 wt% chitin reinforcement had the lowest tensile and flexural strength compared to other composites produced using additive manufacturing.The reduction in strength and stiffness of the chitin/PLA and chitosan/PLA composites, in comparison to neat PLA, was attributed to the decreased interfacial bonding between the reinforcement and matrix. This resulted in polymeric slippage when the composite was subjected to an external load. However, the chitin/PLA and chitosan/PLA composites demonstrated enhanced ductility relative to neat PLA, with the 0.1 wt% chitin composite showing the highest ductility. It was concluded that chitin and chitosan could contribute to toughening the PLA composite.The study also found that the density of the composites increased with increasing concentrations of chitin and chitosan. FTIR and XRD analyses confirmed the crystalline and chemical bonding nature of the composite samples. Microstructural examination showed voids and impurity-like particles associated with chitin and chitosan decomposition in the composites. The Chitin/PLA and Chitosan/PLA composites exhibited good thermal stability, and could have potential applications for food product packaging based on their compressive properties.Further research is needed to investigate interfacial bonding and post-treatment processes to improve the mechanical characteristics of the composites and scalability of the method for industrial production. One thing for sure, using the chitosan (chitin) derived from terrestrial insects as a material for making filaments for 3D printing of parts could lend to a low carbon way of meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12, i.e., promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns.

  "text": "A chemical analyst and expert in micro-extraction at The University of Toledo created a more reliable, robust and efficient way to monitor pesticide exposure and help protect the health and safety of agricultural workers, especially for emerging sectors like the cannabis industry.          Dr. Emanuela Gionfriddo, an assistant professor of analytical chemistry, and Nipunika H. Godage, a Ph.D. candidate in UToledo's Dr. Nina McClelland Laboratory for Water Chemistry and Environmental Analysis, published research in the journal Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry outlining their groundbreaking method that is able to detect 79 pesticide residues in human blood plasma at \"ultra-trace\" levels, or parts per trillion.\"This has the potential to be applied to human exposure studies for the general public such as exposure through food or contaminated water but, most importantly, agricultural workers who have a higher potential for acute exposure to these toxic chemicals, which typically occurs through the skin, with pesticides then passing into the bloodstream and circulating through the body,\" Gionfriddo said.Pesticides are widely used in farming to prevent or reduce produce losses caused by pests and improve the quality of fruits and vegetables, but human exposure during mixing or application has been reported to cause neurological disorders, poisoning, cancer, reproductive disruptions, respiratory problems and chronic kidney diseases among farm workers.Though pesticides are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Gionfriddo said the legalization of cannabis recently in several states has led to \"inexperienced\" farmers being exposed to the harmful chemicals since those workers are less familiar with pesticide safety equipment and procedures as well as proper pesticide storage and handling.The pesticides selected for her study are the most commonly used pesticides during cannabis cultivation.Gionfriddo's new testing method uses what's called bio solid-phase microextraction with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.\"To meet the growing demands of regulatory agencies and routine analysis laboratories, sample throughput and method tunability is critical,\" Gionfriddo said. \"Using automated samplers, the preparation time per sample is 1.7 minutes.\"And as occupational exposure to pesticides can occur at varying concentration levels, it is important for any method to quantify pesticides at low concentrations. The new testing method demonstrated higher sensitivity, precision and accuracy and a drastic reduction in abnormalities compared to the commonly used approach, known as QuEChERS, which stands for Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe but can be labor intensive with prolonged workflows.Last week during National Farmworker Awareness Week, the U.S. EPA said pesticide exposure doesn't only happen when working in the fields. The federal agency said pesticide take-home exposure can occur when farm workers go home bearing pesticide residues that may cling to their skin, clothing, hats, boots, tools, lunch coolers or other items in their work environment. Their children may then be exposed to these pesticide residues.\"Assessing pesticide exposure quickly and thoroughly is crucial for the health and safety of workers and their families, to correct malpractices in pesticide storage and application, and to prevent further exposure,\" Godage said. \"Our new method can extract and analyze simultaneously a wide variety of pesticides from human plasma.\" More information:Nipunika H.

  "text": "In an advance they consider a breakthrough in computational chemistry research, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison chemical engineers have developed model of how catalytic reactions work at the atomic scale. This understanding could allow engineers and chemists to develop more efficient catalysts and tune industrial processes\u2014potentially with enormous energy savings, given that 90% of the products we encounter in our lives are produced, at least partially, via catalysis.          Catalyst materials accelerate chemical reactions without undergoing changes themselves. They are critical for refining petroleum products and for manufacturing pharmaceuticals, plastics, food additives, fertilizers, green fuels, industrial chemicals and much more.Scientists and engineers have spent decades fine-tuning catalytic reactions\u2014yet because it's currently impossible to directly observe those reactions at the extreme temperatures and pressures often involved in industrial-scale catalysis, they haven't known exactly what is taking place on the nano and atomic scales. This new research helps unravel that mystery with potentially major ramifications for industry.In fact, just three catalytic reactions\u2014steam-methane reforming to produce hydrogen, ammonia synthesis to produce fertilizer, and methanol synthesis\u2014use close to 10% of the world's energy.\"If you decrease the temperatures at which you have to run these reactions by only a few degrees, there will be an enormous decrease in the energy demand that we face as humanity today,\" says Manos Mavrikakis, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at UW\u2013Madison who led the research. \"By decreasing the energy needs to run all these processes, you are also decreasing their environmental footprint.\"Mavrikakis and postdoctoral researchers Lang Xu and Konstantinos G. Papanikolaou along with graduate student Lisa Je published news of their advance in the April 7, 2023 issue of the journal Science.In their research, the UW\u2013Madison engineers develop and use powerful modeling techniques to simulate catalytic reactions at the atomic scale. For this study, they looked at reactions involving transition metal catalysts in nanoparticle form, which include elements like platinum, palladium, rhodium, copper, nickel, and others important in industry and green energy.      According to the current rigid-surface model of catalysis, the tightly packed atoms of transition metal catalysts provide a 2D surface that chemical reactants adhere to and participate in reactions. When enough pressure and heat or electricity is applied, the bonds between atoms in the chemical reactants break, allowing the fragments to recombine into new chemical products.\"The prevailing assumption is that these metal atoms are strongly bonded to each other and simply provide 'landing spots' for reactants. What everybody has assumed is that metal-metal bonds remain intact during the reactions they catalyze,\" says Mavrikakis. \"So here, for the first time, we asked the question, 'Could the energy to break bonds in reactants be of similar amounts to the energy needed to disrupt bonds within the catalyst?'\"According to Mavrikakis's modeling, the answer is yes. The energy provided for many catalytic processes to take place is enough to break bonds and allow single metal atoms (known as adatoms) to pop loose and start traveling on the surface of the catalyst. These adatoms combine into clusters, which serve as sites on the catalyst where chemical reactions can take place much easier than the original rigid surface of the catalyst.Using a set of special calculations, the team looked at industrially important interactions of eight transition metal catalysts and 18 reactants, identifying energy levels and temperatures likely to form such small metal clusters, as well as the number of atoms in each cluster, which can also dramatically affect reaction rates.Their experimental collaborators at the University of California, Berkeley, used atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to look at carbon monoxide adsorption on nickel (111), a stable, crystalline form of nickel useful in catalysis. Their experiments confirmed models that showed various defects in the structure of the catalyst can also influence how single metal atoms pop loose, as well as how reaction sites form.Mavrikakis says the new framework is challenging the foundation of how researchers understand catalysis and how it takes place. It may apply to other non-metal catalysts as well, which he will investigate in future work. It is also relevant to understanding other important phenomena, including corrosion and tribology, or the interaction of surfaces in motion.\"We're revisiting some very well-established assumptions in understanding how catalysts work and, more generally, how molecules interact with solids,\" Mavrikakis says.Manos Mavrikakis is Ernest Micek Distinguished Chair, James A. Dumesic Professor, and Vilas Distinguished Achievement Professor in Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. Other authors include Barbara A.J.

  "text": "Researchers have developed a novel synthetic substance that has the potential to be a more effective and safer way of delivering drugs around the body.          Currently, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the most commonly used polymer for biomedical applications due to its non-toxicity and high solubility. It has many applications, including coating nanocarriers which ferry pharmaceuticals in a patient's bloodstream.While PEGs have a vast number of benefits, there are also significant shortcomings. Currently, researchers have concerns over PEG's own immunogenicity, so their tendency to trigger an unwanted immune response against themselves. The widespread use of PEG in COVID-19 vaccines and boosters has led to significantly higher levels of PEG-antibodies found in vaccinated people.A team of scientists has created a new \"active stealth\" polymer, called Polythio Glycidyl glycerol (PTGG), which initial data suggests is safer and more effective in drug-delivery.The study, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS), found PTGG was less likely to be detected by immune systems when traveling around a body compared to PEG. It also enhanced physical stability and protected tissue from oxidative and inflammatory damage.Lead author, Dr. Farah El Mohtadi from the University of Portsmouth's School of Pharmacy & Biomedical Sciences, said, \"PTGG's 'active-stealth' character makes it a highly promising alternative to PEG for delivering drugs, and therapeutic proteins.\"Not only can it effectively avoid detection in the bloodstream, the polymer's advantageous properties can also significantly reduce the need for expensive substances to prevent freeze-damage during storage.\"The study's findings have significant implications for the development of more effective and safer drugs and nanocarriers. Further research will be conducted to explore the potential applications of PTGG in clinical settings.\"On top of the medical application, we also want to explore PTGG's potential use in other areas,\" added Dr. El Mohtadi.\"These include temporarily uniting the polymer to enzymes and exploring whether they are more effective at breaking down man-made materials, including plastics.\"The potential for using the polymer to stabilize nylon-degrading enzymes will be explored as part of a Ph.D. studentship at the University's Center for Enzyme Innovation (CEI), a project supervised by Professor Andy Pickford (the CEI Director), Dr. El Mohtadi and Dr. Bruce Lichtenstein.CEI scientists have already developed enzyme technology to reduce single use plastics, including PET, to their chemical building blocks, leading to safe and energy efficient recycling. Now they have set their sights on creating a similar process for polyester textiles, and for this project targeting nylon.Professor Andy Pickford said, \"In an industrial setting, plastic-degrading enzymes must operate under challenging conditions such as high temperature, so we are excited to see whether attaching PTGG to them can enhance their performance.\" More information:Richard d'Arcy et al, A Reactive Oxygen Species-Scavenging 'Stealth' Polymer, Poly(thioglycidyl glycerol), Outperforms Poly(ethylene glycol) in Protein Conjugates and Nanocarriers and Enhances Protein Stability to Environmental and Biological Stressors, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2022).

  "text": "A team of researchers has developed an electronic biosensor based on DNA aptamers that can detect biomarkers in whole blood samples without the addition of reagents. As the team explains in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition, the DNA aptamers recognize marker proteins as efficiently as antibodies do, but are easier to prepare and more adaptable. The biosensor was able to detect clinically relevant levels of a marker protein for cardiovascular disease without any further sample preparation.          Researchers aim to develop diagnostic tools that can detect disease biomarkers directly, reliably, and in the field, without the need to send samples to specialized laboratories for analysis. Shana O. Kelley of the University of Toronto, Canada, and Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, U.S., and her team have developed a simple chip-based device to detect marker proteins in complex samples using chronoamperometric measurements.Their nanoscale sensor system works as a molecular \"pendulum\": it measures the extra load a protein places on the pendulum, which consists of a strand of DNA tethered to an electrode. The approach does not require any external reagents.Typically, antibodies are used to seek out and bind marker proteins in complex mixtures. However, antibodies are themselves proteins, and as such are quite complex to design and produce. Kelley and colleagues have now found that the smaller and simpler DNA aptamers can be used instead of antibodies. DNA aptamers are short synthetic fragments of with specific shapes and structures. They are relatively easy to make and, with customizable structures, cheaper to produce than antibodies.Like antibodies, DNA aptamers can bind marker proteins through molecular and structural interactions, but they are easier to design. \"DNA has the most predictable and programmable interactions of any natural or synthetic molecule,\" explain Kelley and her team. To develop an aptamer-based sensor, they created a DNA aptamer that specifically detects B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a biomarker for cardiovascular disease, and linked this aptamer with the DNA pendulum strand tethered to the gold electrode to create the molecular pendulum sensor.The completed biosensor successfully detected BNP, even in complex mixtures such as unprocessed whole blood from cardiac patients. Because Kelley and colleagues found that the sensitivity of the aptamer-based system was as high as that of antibody-based detection, they suggest further research and use of DNA aptamers for laboratory-independent diagnostics.

  "text": "A research team co-led by chemists from City University of Hong Kong (CityU) recently discovered novel, highly effective anticancer agents with tridimensional structures, which have high anticancer activity, low toxicity and the ability to overcome drug resistance in cancer cells. The findings help provide a new direction for anticancer drug development.          Cancer has long been a devastating disease, which affects millions of people worldwide. Despite advances in treatment, current anticancer drugs often have limited effectiveness, lack of cancer selectivity, serious side effects and drug resistance in cancer cells.\"The structure of drugs greatly affects their anticancer performance,\" explained Dr. Zhu Guangyu, Associate Professor in the Department of Chemistry at CityU. \"Most anticancer drugs have planar structures; developing new compounds with tridimensional structures may provide an opportunity to address the limitations of current anticancer drugs.\"In collaboration with researchers from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), the team tested a new class of tridimensional and chiral compounds, which exhibit promising anticancer activity and present action mechanisms that are distinct from conventional anticancer drugs to overcome drug resistance.The team first developed a new, highly efficient catalytic synthetic strategy to obtain a novel class of tridimensional and chiral tetraarylmethane compounds that presented better anticancer activity and lower toxicity than the clinical anticancer drug doxorubicin.In their experiments, the research team tested the compounds with cancer cells in vitro, using doxorubicin as a control. They found that the tetraarylmethane compounds were more cytotoxic to cancer cells, including lung cancer stem cells (LCSCs), which are notorious for their drug resistance to clinical chemotherapeutic drugs, causing treatment failure. The compound also exhibited better cancer cell selectivity as it caused less harm to normal living cells, suggesting lower toxicity.                The synthesized lead compounds induced necroptosis in lung cancer stem cells. The arrows indicate cell membrane permeabilization. Credit: Tan, X. et al. https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-022-00211-4             The team further analyzed the structure-activity relationship of synthesized compounds. They found that the presence of certain substituents, including halogen and hydroxyl groups, at certain positions of the tetraarylmethane compounds significantly improved their cytotoxicity to cancer cells.      Upon treatment with the synthesized compound, some cancer cells started to die, as organelle swelling, cell membrane permeabilization, nuclear shrinkage and fragmentation were observed. This suggests that necrotic cell death might have been triggered by the tetraarylmethane compounds.In the fight against cancer, the majority of anticancer drugs currently available rely on the activation of apoptotic pathways to eliminate cancer cells. However, a promising new avenue of research for reducing drug resistance lies in the development of novel anticancer agents that target alternative cell death pathways. In their experiments, the team found that these innovative compounds induced a different cell death pathway.This suggests that the compounds can bypass the resistance mechanisms generated by conventional drugs, making them highly desirable for further exploration in the field of cancer treatment.\"The satisfactory anticancer performance and unique mechanism make these compounds potential candidates for anticancer agents for further development,\" said Dr. Zhu. The team plans to synthesize more compounds and conduct further experiments to evaluate their anticancer performance.Their findings were published in Nature Synthesis.

  "text": "Ever since it was discovered to be a driving force behind economically and environmentally destructive harmful algal blooms (HABs) throughout the world, researchers have been trying to discover more information about the effects of different types of nitrogen, such as nitrate or ammonium, on the proliferation of HABs.          At the University of Delaware, Kathyrn Coyne, associate professor in the School of Marine Science and Policy (SMSP), has spent several years studying HABs\u2014including Heterosigma akashiwo, a globally distributed toxic species of alga. About 10 years ago, with funds from Delaware Sea Grant (DESG), Coyne's lab discovered that Heterosigma akashiwo is able to use nitric oxide as a nitrogen source.It does this by using a unique modification of an enzyme called nitrate reductase. This enzyme typically catalyzes the first step in the process of converting nitrate to ammonium, a more useable form of nitrogen. The modification of nitrate reductase in Heterosigma akashiwo allows it to use nitric oxide instead of nitrate as a source of nitrogen.\"This kind of raised a lot of questions,\" Coyne said. \"Where would they be accessing nitric oxide in the environment? What kind of advantage does it give Heterosigma akashiwo to have this modification in their enzyme? And how do other types of nitrogen affect its ability to use nitric oxide?\"The last question was answered in a recent article about the results of the research in Scientific Reports.The lead author on this paper, Emily Healey, received her master's degree at UD in marine biosciences and is a doctoral student at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. Along with Coyne, other co-authors include Joanna York, professor in the School of Marine Science and Policy and Director of DESG, and Robinson Fulweiler, professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University, as well as past members of Coyne's lab, Stacie Flood and Patience Bock.REU participantHealey said that while she joined Coyne's lab as a master's student in the summer of 2019, she came to UD and worked with Coyne earlier as a participant in the SMSP Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) summer program.\"I have always been interested in microbiology and to have the opportunity to spend my summer at the beach through the REU program was pretty amazing,\" Healey said. \"Dr. Coyne runs a great lab. She had really helpful Ph.D. students working for her, and I just loved the work. I had never worked with algae before\u2014I had been doing more with bacteria so it was interesting to get immersed in a different microbe.\"After her REU experience, Healey was able to come back the next year to start her master's program. During that time, she began the research which would eventually lead to this recent publication.      Nitrate reductase Healey said one of the goals of her research was to see if other nitrogen sources affect the activity of nitrate reductase in Heterosigma akashiwo and its ability to take up nitric oxide. For example, if there is a lot of ammonium present in an environment from agricultural sources, most species will down-regulate the nitrate reductase enzyme, which might affect Heterosigma's ability to use nitric oxide.\"We thought if there's a lot of ammonium, maybe Heterosigma akashiwo isn't able to use nitric oxide as a source of nitrogen,\" said Healey. \"Maybe if there's ammonium present, they simply turn off that enzyme.\"By shutting off the enzyme in the presence of ammonium, the possibility existed that Heterosigma akashiwo would be inhibited or even prevented from accessing nitric oxide and turning it into biomass.What they found, however, was that even when there was ammonium present, providing nitric oxide to cultures of Heterosigma akashiwo actually increased activity of the enzyme so that it was able to successfully take up nitric oxide and convert it to biomass in the presence of ammonium.To determine the effects of different types of nitrogen on nitrate reductase, the researchers conducted three experiments. They grew Heterosigma akashiwo in the lab first with only nitrate, then with only ammonium, and finally with a 50/50 mix of nitrate and ammonium.In each of the experiments, the activity of the enzyme nitrate reductase not only increased when nitric oxide was added, but results showed that Heterosigma was incorporating nitric oxide into biomass even in the presence of ammonium.Coyne said this ability potentially gives Heterosigma akashiwo an advantage over other species, by allowing them to access a novel source of nitrogen.\"If that were the case, then Heterosigma may be able to use nitric oxide as an alternative that other species simply don't have access to,\" said Coyne.Nitrogen in the sedimentsThis ability to use nitric oxide as a nitrogen source may have something to do with how Heterosigma akashiwo moves throughout the day\u2014as the species will move up to the surface of the water during the day and return to the bottom of the water column during the night.\"At night, Heterosigma migrates to the sediments and then during the day time, they're photosynthetic so they move up to the surface where they are exposed to sunlight,\" said Coyne. \"There is a lot of data showing that nitric oxide seeps up through the sediments in some coastal areas, so we think Heterosigma may be accessing that nitric oxide as a nitrogen source at night.\"Healey said this ability to use nitric oxide may have a few implications. One would be that it gives Heterosigma akashiwo an advantage over other algae when other types of nitrogen have been depleted.In addition, Healey said that nitric oxide should be considered a factor in bloom formation for Heterosigma akashiwo.\"People often study the effects of nitrogen on blooms and how to prevent blooms in the first place by reducing nitrate or ammonium,\" said Healey. \"Now, we're saying, 'Ok, add nitric oxide to that list because it could be important.'\" More information:Emily M.

  "text": "A new way of using 3D printing to create infection-fighting materials for use as medical implants has been revealed in a new research paper, published in Advanced Materials Technologies.          Engineers at the University of Bath, working with colleagues at the University of Ulster, have for the first time successfully created a new kind of ferroelectric composite material with antimicrobial properties using a novel multi-material 3D printing process.They say the use of electrically responsive ferroelectric materials gives the implants the infection-fighting properties, making them ideal for biomedical applications, such as heart valves, stents and bone implants, reducing the risk of infection for patients.Reducing riskWhile commonplace, all biomedical implants pose some level of risk as materials can carry surface bio-contaminants that can lead to infection. Reducing this risk could be beneficial both to patients in the form of improved outcomes, and to healthcare providers thanks to reduced costs incurred by ongoing treatment.The team has previously used this 3D printing technique for the fabrication of three-dimensional scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.Dr. Hamideh Khanbareh, a lecturer in materials and structures in Bath's Department of Mechanical Engineering, is lead author of the research. She says that the development has the scope for wide-ranging applications.She says, \"Biomedical implants that can fight infection or dangerous bacteria such as E. coli could present significant benefits to patients and to health care providers.\"Our research indicates that the ferroelectric composite materials we have created have a great potential as antimicrobial materials and surfaces. This is a potentially game-changing development that we would be keen to develop further through collaboration with medical researchers or health care providers.\"Infection-busting propertiesThe innovation comes thanks to ferroelectricity, a characteristic of certain polar materials that generate electrical surface charge in response to a change in mechanical energy or temperature. In ferroelectric films and implants, this electrical charge leads to the formation of free radicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which selectively eradicate bacteria. This comes about through the micro-electrolysis of water molecules on a surface of polarized ferroelectric composite material.The composite material used to harness this phenomenon is made by embedding ferroelectric barium calcium zirconate titanate (BCZT) micro-particles in polycaprolactone (PCL) a biodegradable polymer widely used in biomedical applications. The mixture of the ferroelectric particles and polymer is then fed into a 3D bioprinter to create a specific porous \"scaffold\" shape designed to have a high surface area to promote ROS formation.Testing showed that even when contaminated with high concentrations of aggressive E. coli bacteria, the composite can completely eradicate the bacteria cells without external intervention, killing 70% within just 15 minutes.

  "text": "Studying the microbiology of any entity, be it a molecule or a dolphin, ideally means putting a spotlight as close to the source material as possible. That can be especially challenging when you're investigating the Rube Goldberg environment of a cell's nucleus.          But in research published this week in Nature, Princeton chemists from the Muir Lab and the MacMillan Lab used two marquee technologies to shine a light right where they wanted it.In the process, they discovered critical, unexpected changes in interactions surrounding a DNA-protein complex called chromatin\u2014essentially, an architecture that allows for the compaction of DNA\u2014in the presence of genetic mutations widely associated with cancer.Interactions between biomolecules control every biological function. Mapping their activity leads to a deeper understanding of cell fate. So researchers paired the strengths of \u00b5Map, the MacMillan Lab's proximity-labeling system introduced three years ago, with in nucleo protein trans-splicing, a protein engineering technology introduced in 2016 and optimized since by the Muir Lab.\"The whole point of \u00b5Map is to understand biology, broadly defined, in ways that you couldn't beforehand, because \u00b5Map gives you such incredibly precise information. This research is an example of doing precisely that,\" said David MacMillan, the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry and a recipient of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\"With this research, we saw that the biology is happening because of these mutations,\" he said. \"It was impossible to see that before, so we were driving in the dark. It's another piece in this whole wall, a brick of what \u00b5Map's going to be able to do. It's still just the beginning, but this is a true collaboration.\"The combination of these technologies allowed researchers to tether an iridium photocatalyst to a protein of interest to study these minute interactions and how they change in the presence of mutations\u2014all without impacting the complex microenvironment within the cell nucleus.The photocatalyst highlighted a radius of focus just one nucleosome wide, allowing researchers to peer into this microenvironment with unprecedented specificity.\"So many things in biology and disease come down to how chromatin moves and changes,\" said Ciaran Seath, a former postdoc in the MacMillan Lab and co-lead author on the paper with Antony Burton, a former postdoc in the Muir Lab. \"Viruses, aging, cancers, all the things we looked at, change how chromatin can move and react. We figured, if you could watch that, you could learn about all of these different problems in a modular way.\"Sometimes you can't see or predict all the other things that are likely to happen in the machine of the nucleus. Now that we have paired these tools, we can measure these unforeseen consequences. It's like touching a point on a spider's web,\" he said. \"You can see the whole thing move.\"Burton added, \"What the synergy of these technologies gets you, in a minimally perturbative way, is the ability to install a small catalyst onto a protein of interest and then map what's nearby. We were able to illuminate protein interactions and complex, downstream effects at a level of detail that is very hard to do with other methods.\"Most importantly, we can chart how these change as a function of mutation or drug treatment, presenting opportunities for academic and industrial application.\"The research was authored by Seath, now an assistant professor of chemistry at the Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology in Jupiter, Florida; Burton, now a senior scientist in chemical biology at AstraZeneca in Boston, Massachusetts; and senior scientists Thomas Muir, the Van Zandt Williams Jr. Class of 1965 Professor, and MacMillan.      Advancing the field of epigeneticsThe research has important implications for epigenetics, the branch of biology that explores changes in gene expression. At the heart of epigenetics are histone proteins, which package DNA and restrict access to the genome, thereby playing a key role in regulating transcription.Recently, mutations to these histone proteins have been discovered and linked to a wide range of cancers.\"One of the things we looked at was adding a mutation that occurs in a histone that's linked to cancer,\" said Muir. \"What we wanted to know is, what happens when that mutation is present; what can no longer be recruited, what's no longer in the neighborhood, what new things are brought in that shouldn't normally be there?\"We were able to use these technologies to find all sort of things that get changed when we put this mutation on the chromatin, things related to gene regulation,\" he added. \"We were able to infer mechanistic insights that relate to how genes get misregulated with a mutation.\"Beginning their research three years ago, the team hypothesized that the mutation associated with cancer precipitates some sort of loss of function. Biomolecules find chromatin and bind with it to leave a transcriptional mark. Researchers believed that the mutation blocked some of that action, thus leading to cell dysfunction.Their hypothesis was borne out with this research, which generated molecular detail on how a tiny change in the genome can lead to major impacts.

  "text": "Tom Stavert, a joint Ph.D. researcher between Sheffield and Strathclyde, has published an article in the journal RSC Sustainability exploring how combining computational modeling with green chemical principles can enable sustainable manufacture.          Novel research methods critical to the decarbonization of industry have been highlighted in a new paper published by a Sheffield-Strathclyde research team.Tom Stavert is a postgraduate researcher whose Ph.D. is a joint collaboration between the University of Sheffield and the University of Strathclyde, supervised by Prof. Siddharth Patwardhan and Dr. Miguel Jorge, respectively, who also contributed to the new paper alongside Dr. Robert Pilling.The focus of Tom's research is combining novel experimental and computational approaches to produce sustainable nanomaterials.His recent research has culminated in the publication of the article titled \"Unlocking the holy grail of sustainable and scalable mesoporous silica using computational modeling,\" in RSC Sustainability.Ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) has applications in the likes of gas separation, catalysis, drug delivery in patients, and biosensors\u2014the latter can be used for disease monitoring among other things.However, despite the discovery of OMS 30 years ago, it's not yet possible to produce such materials sustainably because they require high temperature and pressure, extreme pH, and harsh, toxic chemicals, as well as forming polluted water, making it a highly energy and resource intensive process.Bio-inspired methods offer a great alternative for the design of high-value mesoporous silica under more environmentally considerate conditions, allowing for both sustainable and economic scale up. However, at present, synthesis of bio-inspired silica (BIS) is not fully understood, which creates barriers to achieving products comparable in quality to traditional mesoporous silica.As such, this article summarizes key findings in the development of OMS and BIS synthesis, with focus on the challenges in the development of scalable routes for the production of these materials. It also highlights recent triumphs in improving the mechanistic understanding of syntheses using computational modeling, as well as how modeling can be used for the predictive design of BIS.Through combining computational modeling with the principles of green and sustainable chemistry, there is the potential to transform material discovery and sustainable manufacture. This approach can reduce production costs by two orders of magnitude in some cases.With OMS having a wide range of applications, future outcomes from this work align with multiple of the UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs): SDG 6\u2014clean water and sanitation, SDG 7\u2014affordable and clean energy, SDG 9\u2014industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG12\u2014responsible consumption and production, and SDG 13\u2014climate action.On his recent publication, Tom said, \"Being part of a collaborative Ph.D. project has given me a fantastic perspective of the importance of taking a multi-disciplinary approach to solving research challenges as it combines both experimental and computational methods.\"In this article we highlight how seemingly unrelated strands of research can be joined together to create novel and effective research methods, drawing on expertise from researchers with diverse skillsets. This combined approach will be critical to decarbonising industry and effectively tackling climate change.\" More information:Tom Stavert et al, Unlocking the holy grail of sustainable and scalable mesoporous silica using computational modelling, RSC Sustainability (2023).

  "text": "Woolen clothing has been around for as long as humans have been wearing clothes and sheep have been domesticated. Indeed, our distant ancestors used sheep for three things: food, clothing and shelter\u2014wool makes good insulation and helps to keep in the warmth.          The UK is still one of the largest wool producers in the world and has more than 60 different breeds of sheep.But with the rise of veganism, many people are now questioning whether it's ethical to use wool in clothing and fabrics. Vegans don't wear wool as it is often a by-product of the meat industry.This is why the charity PETA (The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has launched a US$1 million (\u00a3844,000) vegan wool challenge to find the first individual, group, or company that can create a vegan wool material that is \"visually, textually and functionally akin to or better than sheep's wool.\"But it seems that back in the 1940s, textile physicist William Astbury was already on the case and making newspaper headlines for wearing what would today be considered a vegan coat.For Astbury's jacket was woven not from wool or other conventional textile materials, but from Ardil, a fiber made from monkey nut, or peanut proteins.The monkey nut coatIn my book The Man in the Monkeynut Coat: William Astbury and How Wool Wove a Forgotten Road to the Double-Helix, I tell the story of Astbury (and that famous coat), who with his colleague Florence Bell laid the foundations for the discovery of the structure of DNA.Scientists James Watson and Francis Crick are famous for having first worked out the structure of DNA. But their success came 15 years after Astbury and Bell had first shown that X-rays could actually reveal DNA's structure.And this work had a surprising origin, for Astbury's aim was not to answer grand questions about the secrets of life, but to study the humble wool fiber while working as a lecturer in textile physics at the University of Leeds.Ever since the Middle Ages, wool and textiles were the economic lifeblood of this Yorkshire city\u2014with mills a major source of employment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.In 1928 Astbury came to Leeds and used X-rays to reveal the molecular shape of the proteins in wool fibers. He found that they could be compacted or elongated\u2014rather like a slinky toy. This change in their molecular architecture explained the stretchiness of wool\u2014a property that made it so attractive to the textile industry.And through it, Astbury left another powerful scientific legacy\u2014thanks to his sporting of that rather unusual \"peanut\" overcoat.      A future wool?From the mid-1930s onwards, Astbury, along with his collaborators Albert Chibnall and Kenneth Bailey, filed patents on a process that used solvents such as urea to unravel the precise 3D shape of proteins found in seeds\u2014like the peanut. Their method then refolded them by a kind of molecular origami into insoluble fibers, creating a cheap and abundant raw material for the textile industry.Sharing his optimism, the company Imperial Chemical Industries bought these patents and built a pilot production plant in Scotland to produce a new textile fiber from peanuts, which they called Ardil and gifted Astbury an overcoat made from it.During the second world war, wool shortages encouraged investment in Ardil and campaigns were launched to persuade the British public of its benefits. This drive to develop new textile fibers at the time may also have inspired a storyline in the 1951 British comedy film The Man in the White Suit.In the film, an altruistic chemist invents a fabric that resists wear and stain, but (spoiler alert) his dreams come crashing down when management realizes the fabric must be suppressed for economic reasons as it threatens their livelihoods.Unfortunately, much like the fictional fiber, Ardil did not live up to its promise of saving the British textile industry. But Astbury and his overcoat left an important scientific legacy.His work remains important because it showcased his lifelong belief that understanding living systems requires solving their molecular architecture. While Ardil did not succeed, Astbury's research laid the foundation for future innovations in molecular biology and materials science.This approach, known as structural biology, has since allowed us to understand how the blood protein hemoglobin can carry oxygen around the body, how muscles contract and more recently how the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV2 allows the virus to bind and enter human cells.When Astbury died in 1961, his friend and colleague, the botanist R.D. Preston, fondly remembered him as \"a man of many parts\u2014scientist, scholar, musician, bon viveur, humorist, in some ways, a swashbuckler\u2026boisterous to the end with every morning still a Christmas morning.\" Maybe to this list of accolades, we should also add a posthumous nomination for the $1 million vegan wool prize.

  "text": "To manage atmospheric carbon dioxide and convert the gas into a useful product, Cornell scientists have dusted off an archaic\u2014now 120 years old\u2014electrochemical equation. The group aims to thwart the consequences of global warming and climate change by applying this long-forgotten idea in a new way.          The calculation\u2014named the Cottrell equation for chemist Frederick Gardner Cottrell, who developed it in 1903\u2014can help today's researchers understand the several reactions that carbon dioxide can take when electrochemistry is applied and pulsed on a lab bench.Their work was published March 27 in the journal ACS Catalysis.\"For carbon dioxide, the better we understand the reaction pathways, the better we can control the reaction\u2014which is what we want in the long term,\" said lead author Rileigh Casebolt DiDomenico, a doctoral student in the Smith School of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, in Cornell Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Tobias Hanrath.The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide presents an opportunity to transform the gas from an environmental liability to a feedstock for chemical products or as a medium to store renewable electricity in the form of chemical bonds, as nature does.\"If we have better control over the reaction, then we can make what we want, when we want to make it,\" DiDomenico said. \"The Cottrell equation is the tool that helps us to get there.\"In simple terms, the equation depicts a change in the measured electrochemical current over specific references to time during an experiment. What that means in a lab is that carbon dioxide is subjected to various applied potentials stepped up or down, or pulsed and these, in turn, generate a current that is related to the products formed from the reduction of carbon dioxide.DiDomenico first encountered this antique equation as a doctoral student in a class taught by H\u00e9ctor Abru\u00f1a, the Emile M. Chamot Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, in the College of Arts and Sciences, a senior author on the paper.Intrigued after Abru\u00f1a mentioned it in class, DiDomenico implemented the Cottrell equation in her own work on carbon dioxide reduction. She changed the electrochemical values (such as applied potential) or the time scale, to generate other products derived from the gas.As an example, the equation enables a researcher to identify and control experimental parameters to take carbon dioxide and convert it into useful carbon products like ethylene, ethane or ethanol.      At first, DiDomenico thought she got strange results, but confirmed later that she had conducted the experiments correctly.\"I was trying to change the pulse profile to make ethylene specifically by applying what I was learning in class to see if it fit,\" DiDomenico said. \"I realized that this was actually a way that we could identify a mechanism for reducing carbon dioxide into a useful product.\"Many researchers today use advanced computational methods to provide a detailed atomistic picture of processes at the catalyst surface, but these methods often involve several nuanced assumptions, which complicate direct comparison to experiments, said senior author Tobias Hanrath, the Marjorie L. Hart '50 Professor in Engineering, in the Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.\"The magnificence of this old equation is that there are very few assumptions,\" Hanrath said. \"If you put in experimental data, you get a better sense of truth. It's an old classic. That's the part that I thought was beautiful.\"Abru\u00f1a enjoyed seeing the equation employed. \"This equation describes what happens when one imposes a potential step, so you go from one voltage to another, and then look at the resulting current transient,\" he said. \"By analyzing the results, you can derive interesting and important mechanistic information and details. It's just that unless you're an electrochemical nerd like me, you probably don't know much about that.\"People in the business of carbon dioxide reduction are much more into product distributions, or the engineering aspects of that,\" Abru\u00f1a said. \"Here we are using a very simple model that worked amazingly well. It's almost embarrassingly good.\"DiDomenico said, \"Because it is older, the Cottrell equation has been a forgotten technique. It's classic electrochemistry. Just bringing it back to the forefront of people's minds has been cool. And I think this equation will help other electrochemists to study their own systems.\" More information:Rileigh Casebolt DiDomenico et al, Mechanistic Insights into the Formation of CO and C2 Products in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction\u2500The Role of Sequential Charge Transfer and Chemical Reactions, ACS Catalysis (2023).

They believe their findings suggest that incorporating natural molecules with antioxidant activities into sunscreens could decrease the proportion of conventional UV filters in the final product, with the advantage of providing other functional properties.The product's performance improved without the need to increase active principle levels, reducing both the amount of sunscreen needed to protect the same skin area and the volume of synthetic chemicals discharged into the environment.In vitro and clinical trials obtained a 41% increase in sun protection factor (SPF). The higher the SPF, the more sunburn protection increases.Another advantage of including rosmarinic acid was the addition of antioxidant activity to photoprotection so that the product could be used in antiaging cosmetics, for example.\"Our research on photoprotective systems aims primarily to evaluate potential sunscreen enhancement strategies. We're interested above all in discovering ways to increase sunburn protection while also improving the stability of the product so that it remains safe and effective for longer,\" said pharmaceutical scientist and biochemist Andr\u00e9 Rolim Baby, last author of the article and a professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCF-USP) in Brazil.\"We're also looking for products or systems with less environmental impact and ways of reducing the concentration of conventional filters by including natural ingredients that enhance the formulation.

  "text": "Materials that can conduct negatively charged hydrogen atoms in ambient conditions could pave the way for advanced clean energy storage and electrochemical conversion technologies. A research team from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) demonstrated a technique that enables a room-temperature all-solid-state hydride cell by introducing and exploiting defects in the lattice structure of rare earth hydrides. Their study was published in Nature on April 5.          Solid materials that conduct lithium, sodium and hydrogen cations have been used in batteries and fuel cells. Under certain conditions, some of the materials transition to superionic states where ions move as fast as they do in liquids by skipping through the rigid crystal structure. This phenomenon is advantageous for chemical and energy conversions as it allows ions to move without a liquid or soft membrane to separate the electrodes. However, few solid-state materials can reach this state under ambient conditions.\"Materials that exhibit superionic conduction at ambient conditions would provide huge opportunities for constructing brand new all-solid-state hydride batteries, fuel cells and electrochemical cells for the storage and conversion of clean energy,\" said Prof. Chen Ping, study author from DICP.With strong reducibility and high redox potential, hydride ion (H\u2212) conductors have emerged as promising candidates for this technology. Several H\u2212 conductors have already been developed in recent years, including alkaline earth metal hydrides and oxyhydrides of alkaline earth and rare earth metals, which are known for fast hydrogen migration. But none of the materials developed could achieve superionic conduction at ambient conditions\u2014until the DICP team took a new approach.The DICP research team targeted the structure and morphology of trihydrides\u2014hyrdrides containing three atoms of hydrogen per molecule\u2014of certain rare earth elements (REHx), including Lanthanum (La).Strategies to enhance electronic conductivities typically seek to diminish crystallographic imperfections for applications like metallic nanowire interconnects and nanostructured photovoltaic semiconductors. In this study, however, the research team purposely created abundant discrete nanosized grains and lattice defects to disturb the path of electron transport in REHx and suppress the electronic conductivity. This is different from engineering conventional materials for ion conduction, which relies upon the consistent structure of high crystallinity.The research team observed how H\u2212 ions diffused easily in REHx lattices by hopping between octahedral and tetrahedral sites in the crystal and across interfaces or grain boundaries. Electrons, on the other hand, encountered substantial scattering at grain boundaries, particle surfaces and other traps, which brought down the electronic conductivities by three to five orders of magnitude from those of their well-crystallized counterparts.\"By creating nano-sized grains, defects and other crystalline mismatched zones in a known ionic-electronic mixed conductor, we demonstrated that the electronic conductivity of LaHx (x ' 2.94) can be largely suppressed by five orders of magnitude,\" said Chen. \"Engineering such a material could transform LaHx into a pure hydride ion conductor with record high conductivities in the temperature range of -40\u2103 to 80\u2103.\"The researchers effectively suppressed electron conduction of LaHx by decreasing the particle size and distorting the lattice via high-energy ball milling, which involves subjecting the material to high-energy collisions. With fast H\u2212 conduction and a high ion transfer number, the deformed LaHx material would enable a hydride ion battery to operate at room temperature or lower.\"This work demonstrates the effectiveness of lattice deformation in suppressing electron conduction in REHx,\" said Chen.The researchers plan to explore the physics underneath the phenomenon and extend the method developed in this study to other hydride materials to broaden the material scope for pure H\u2212 conductors.\"Our near-term goal is to demonstrate a brand new all-solid-state hydride ion battery that is of practical potential,\" said CHEN.

  "text": "Researchers from IMDEA Materials Institute and German medical equipment manufacturer Meotec GmbH have developed the world's first industrially scalable surface modification process for bioabsorbable magnesium alloy wires.          The findings, as reported in two recently published scientific papers in the journal Biomaterials Advances, could have a significant impact in the future use of such wires for biomedical applications.Surface-modified magnesium wires offer enormous potential in the biomedical field, from use in implants, wound closure, cardiovascular stents, nerve regeneration, and as polymer reinforcement in trauma fixation plates.The two recently released publications outline how researchers created a novel technique for the fabrication and continuous surface modification of wires from WE43 magnesium alloy by means of Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO).By improving the surface resistance to corrosion, the new process allows scientists to overcome two of the greatest hurdles to the use of magnesium wires in biomedical implants: their quick rate of degradation and their resulting early loss of mechanical performance.\"You won't find any commercially approved, magnesium wire-based medical devices currently on the market because the high surface-to-volume ratio of magnesium wire results in its rapid degradation rate,\" explained IMDEA Materials researcher and Marie Curie Fellow Syed Wahaaj Ali Rizvi.\"However, by applying these new developments in surface modification, we are able to not only reduce that degradation rate, we were also able to improve their mechanical and biological performance.\"\"For instance, in our recent study, we show that without surface modification, the wires dissolved in an accelerated test environment facilitating simulated bodily fluid at 37 degrees within 24 hours. With our modifications, they remained intact for seven days. And even after four days, they were still demonstrating more than 100 MPa of strength, which is suitable for a number of medical applications.\"Rizvi was one of a number of researchers involved in the publications, alongside fellow IMDEA Materials scientists Prof. Javier Llorca, Prof. Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez, Dr. M\u00f3nica Echeverry Rend\u00f3n, Dr. Muzi Li and Guillermo Dominguez. The work also relied on the contributions of Meotec's Dr. Alexander Kopp, Leon Tillman, Tim Mayer and Kerstin van Gaalen, who was another Marie Curie Fellow within the program.Meotec's Dr. Kopp expressed confidence that the research would lead to a greater industrial interest in the further development and use of surface-modified magnesium wires.\"We are expecting that our new continuous PEO process ('C-PEO') will generate a considerable impact in industry,\" he said. \"Since PEO is one of the most important surface treatments to improve surface resistance and corrosion.\"\"As magnesium is prone to corrosion, the high surface fraction and the aspect ratio of such wires means that a proper surface treatment is of utmost importance. Now, such PEO treatment can potentially be scaled up to high productivity lines by going from a batch to a coil-to-coil process.\"The studies also show that the novel technique of surface modification resulted in a more uniform corrosion pattern of the wires as they dissolved. While altering the superficial structure to create a more porous structure also proved more conducive to the survivability of the cells required for regenerative tissue growth.The next step in the development of a new line of magnesium wire-based medical devices could require completion of additional clinical trials.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the online database created by researchers from Tokyo Tech?",
  "answer_squad": " CycPeptMPDB",
  "text": "CycPeptMPDB, a novel database created by Tokyo Tech researchers, focuses on the membrane permeability of cyclic peptides and could accelerate the development of drugs based on these promising compounds. This database was created by gathering published information on thousands of cyclic peptides and organizing it neatly in an online-accessible platform. Thanks to its search and visualization capabilities, CycPeptMPDB could pave the way to new computational and machine learning methods for screening and designing drugs with cyclic peptides.          One of the greatest challenges in modern drug design is to find compounds that satisfy somewhat contradictory requirements\u2014they need to be small enough to permeate human cell membranes, while being large enough to target various protein surfaces and protein\u2013protein interactions. This is a fine balance to achieve\u2014if the compounds are too large, they may not pass through the cell membrane, and their bioavailability would be affected; if they are too small, they would not retain high specificity to the target protein (or proteins).Scientists estimate that more than 80% of all known proteins associated with diseases cannot be targeted by conventional small-molecule drugs or antibody-based drugs. That is why, in recent years, cyclic peptides have become a very active research area. In principle, these compounds can achieve the fine balance required of modern drugs.A cyclic peptide is a type of organic molecule that consists of amino acids linked together in a circular or lariat shape. What makes them particularly attractive is that they can target intracellular protein\u2013protein interactions, which have been considered \"undruggable\" for decades. Moreover, cyclic peptides are inexpensive to synthesize compared to antibody-based drugs, prompting many pharmaceutical companies to conduct extensive research on these compounds.However, one of the biggest hurdles to overcome in cyclic peptide research is that their membrane permeability\u2014which controls their bioavailability and efficiency as drugs\u2014is low in general, and the mechanisms behind this are not completely understood. Thus, during drug design, it is difficult for researchers to select candidate peptides that are likely to make it through the cell membrane. On top of this, there are currently no openly accessible databases documenting the membrane permeabilities of known cyclic peptides.      A team of researchers from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan, including Professor Yutaka Akiyama, decided to take a step towards making cyclic peptide research easier for everyone. As explained in their latest paper published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, the team created an online database called CycPeptMPDB that contains information on thousands of cyclic peptides, including their membrane permeability.To build the database, they gathered data from previously published papers and pharmaceutical patents. After inspecting more than 40 publications, they collected information on 7,334 cyclic peptides with widely different chemical structures. They loaded the membrane permeability values and important physical parameters such as lipophilicity of these peptides onto the database.Moreover, to make further analysis and visualization of the molecules possible, the researchers calculated the most likely 3D conformation of each peptide and added it to the database. They also encoded the chemical structure of each cyclic peptide in a novel descriptive notation (called HELM), making it possible to unambiguously refer to any cyclic peptide in the database using a short string of text.The team has high hopes for their platform and believe that it could become a game changer in the design and development of cyclic peptide drugs. \"CycPeptMPDB provides several functions, including data storage, statistics and visualization, searching and analysis, and downloading. We expect it will become a valuable tool to support membrane permeability research on cyclic peptides,\" says Prof. Akiyama.It is also worth noting, that databases such as CycPeptMPDB are essential for training machine learning models, which can accelerate the selection of drug candidates and reveal hidden patterns in the data.\"We will continue to collect membrane permeability data of cyclic peptides and record them in CycPeptMPDB. Additionally, future improvements to the database's online analysis platform will include an improved user-friendly interface and more integrative functions,\" says Prof. Akiyama.

  "question_squad": " What is the key driver of climate change?",
  "answer_squad": " carbon dioxide",
  "text": "Being the most abundant and persistent greenhouse gas emitted, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the key driver of climate change. To address the pressing problems associated with climate change and fossil fuel depletion, scientists are looking for viable solutions that can minimize the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere.          One attractive solution to this problem is to convert atmospheric CO2 into more useful compounds. Towards this end, methanol\u2014a raw material, fuel additive, and energy carrier\u2014is widely being explored as a promising conversion option for CO2.While various catalysts are currently used for CO2 conversion reactions, most of them were designed and investigated for use in high-temperature and -pressure conditions. This is a serious limitation for multiple reasons.First, maintaining such conditions requires energy and expensive containment systems. Second, the CO2 hydrogenation reaction is exothermic, and thus proceeds more favorably at lower temperatures. Third, high temperatures can sometimes compromise the stability of catalysts, resulting in their reduced lifespan. Finally, the conversion efficiency of existing heterogenous catalysts is extremely low for catalyzing such conversion reactions.Against this backdrop, a team of researchers led by Professor Hideo Hosono from Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, set out to develop a better catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation. In their study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, they report the development of a novel intermetallic catalyst synthesized via a simple ammonolysis process by combining palladium (Pd) and molybdenum (Mo).To synthesize this catalyst, the researchers employed a simple approach based on ammonolysis of an oxide precursor. Put simply, ammonolysis can be used to combine metals by mixing precursors, such as oxides or nitrates, with ammonia gas at high temperatures. Ammonia reacts with the precursors to form intermediate complexes called metal amides, which then decompose to form the desired intermetallic compound.Using various analytical techniques, the team determined the crystal structure of the \"h-PdMo\" catalyst and probed its chemical and thermal stability. Notably, they found that h-PdMo was stable at temperatures up to 400 \u00b0C and did not decompose in air. \"This kind of robustness is very important when considering the practicality of a catalyst,\" remarks Prof. Hosono.Next, the researchers evaluated the performance of h-PdMo for CO2 hydrogenation under different conditions. At a temperature of 100 \u00b0C, the catalyst was capable of continuous methanol production without any significant sign of degradation, for over 100 hours. Moreover, at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) and under relatively low pressure, the performance of h-PdMo was remarkable.Explaining the findings further, Prof. Hosono says, \"At a pressure of 0.9 MPa, our catalyst achieved a conversion efficiency comparable to or even higher than that of state-of-the-art heterogeneous catalysts, that demonstrate similar turn over efficiency under higher-pressure conditions in the range of 4 to 5 MPa.\"In summary, the researchers developed a very active and stable catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation at room temperature that can be synthesized via a simple process. Prof. Hosono concludes by saying, \"Our discovery provides a frontier for catalyst development, not only for low-temperature methanol synthesis and CO2 conversion reactions, but also for other reactions catalyzed by Pd.\" More information:Hironobu Sugiyama et al, Room-Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol over Air-Stable hcp-PdMo Intermetallic Catalyst, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2023).

  "text": "Living organisms produce a myriad of natural products which can be used in modern medicine and therapeutics. Bacteria and other microbes have become the main source for natural products, including a growing family called ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, or RiPPs. The labs of Douglas Mitchell (MMG), John and Margaret Witt Professor of Chemistry, and Huimin Zhao (CABBI/BSD/GSE/MMG), Steven L. Miller Chair of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have been working in tandem to identify and analyze new RiPPs that could be good candidates for drug development and therapeutics.          \"Compared to other classes of natural products such as alkaloids, terpenes, or polyketides, RiPPs are still underexplored, partly because their biosynthetic gene clusters are quite small and were often overlooked in the past,\" said Zhao. \"So we decided to develop new technologies to discover novel RiPPs with biological activity.\"\"Now that we're in the genomics era, we're realizing just how widespread these groups of natural products are, especially in bacteria,\" said Shravan Dommaraju, a Ph.D. candidate in Mitchell's lab. \"We're basically in this exploration phase, where we know that they're out there, and the goal is to see how many we can find because we don't know what they all do yet.\"In a new paper by the Zhao and Mitchell labs, with co-first authors Dommaraju and Hengqian Ren, a postdoctoral researcher in Zhao's lab, the team reported the discovery of a unique, novel class of RiPPs, which they have named \"daptides.\" Unlike most peptides which have one positively charged and one negatively charged end, or \"terminus,\" daptides instead have two positively charged termini.\"A textbook would say that a peptide has an amino terminus and a carboxy terminus, but in our case, we found a ribosomal peptide that has two amino termini,\" said Ren. \"Because there's positive charge at both ends, this gives daptides some interesting bioactivities.\"The researchers explained that while this change in termini may seem small, the positive charge of both termini gives daptides the potential to interact with negatively charged objects, such as cell membranes. To test this, the team added the daptides to a dish with red blood cells. They found that the daptides showed hemolytic activity, meaning that they disrupted the membranes of the cells, causing them to rupture. Zhao explained that hemolytic activity is rarely found in the RiPPs the team works with, and that antimicrobial or antifungal activity is much more common.\"We were thinking about the structure and what is the evolutionary drive to cause a peptide to lose the negatively charged C terminus and replace it with a positively charged amino group,\" Dommaraju said. \"From an engineering perspective, if you wanted to make a peptide that can interact with a membrane, you would stick a bunch of positive charges on it. And that's actually what led us to testing this for hemolytic activity because we knew that it had this modification that should allow for that.\"      Finding new RiPPs is no easy task. First the researchers use bioinformatics to compare and try to identify gene clusters that could produce potential RiPPs. Then they clone the targeted cluster and place it into an organism to be expressed, after which they can check for any natural products produced. Even after obtaining the products, there is still the question of what the products do and how they are produced, which can be tested with bioassays, gene knockouts, and a variety of other tests. But Dommaraju says the labs each play to their expertise when collaborating to streamline the process.\"So on a project like this, the Mitchell lab does the bioinformatics and identifies cool gene clusters, and the Zhao lab gets the synthetic biology system up and going to express these peptides and make them,\" Dommaraju explained. \"So then we are able to tag team our experience and the overlapping stuff that we do to get the project to the finish line.\"The researchers say the next steps are to understand the enzyme functions of the daptides, and use bioinformatics analysis to see if there are other combinations of genes associated with daptide production. Directions for further studies in the future include exploring potential therapeutic uses for daptides, and the ecological role that daptide production has for the bacteria that make them. However, both Ren and Dommaraju agreed that their interests in future experiments with RiPPs extends beyond just daptides, as there are still more classes to discover.\"We're interested in using our bioinformatics tool to find as many different natural product classes as we possibly can,\" said Ren. \"There is such a large frontier right now of undiscovered RiPP classes, and it's exciting to be at the cutting edge, discovering new possibilities. There's always a chance that the next product you find might be a major therapeutic development!\"The paper is published in Nature Communications.

  "question_squad": " What is the term for the process where bacteria floats along and starts new colonies?",
  "answer_squad": " biofouling",
  "text": "Similar to how cells within human tissues communicate and function together as a whole, bacteria are also able to communicate with each other through chemical signals, a behavior known as quorum signaling (QS). These chemical signals spread through a biofilm that colonies of bacteria form after they reach a certain density, and are used to help the colonies scavenge food, as well as defend against threats, like antibiotics.          \"QS helps them to build infrastructure around them, like a city,\" described Dharmesh Parmar, a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Jonathan Sweedler (CABBI/BSD/MMG), James R. Eiszner Family Endowed Chair in the department of chemistry. \"Biofilms have channels, which allow passage of nutrients, and information in the form of chemical signals. They also allow crosstalk between colonies if there's a threat or the stress in the environment.\"Biofilm formation and the subsequent resistance to antibiotics can be especially dangerous for people with a weakened immunity or with diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), which leads to a stagnant mucus surface inside the lungs that bacteria can more easily attach to. To better understand what surface factors influence or potentially inhibit biofilm formation in the presence of antibiotics, researchers from the Sweedler lab at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, along with collaborators at the University of Notre Dame, measured rate of biofilm formation via QS in a bacteria commonly acquired in hospital infections, Pseudomonas aeruginosa.P. aeruginosa forms biofilms rapidly on a variety of surfaces, which expedites when colonies start communicating using QS, and makes treatment with antibiotics difficult. Additionally, P. aeruginosa can vary in the thickness of the biofilm it produces. The \"mucoid\" strain produces a thicker biofilm than the non-mucoid strain, and is often linked to infections in patients with CF, a genetic condition which increases mucus viscosity and accumulation in the lungs.In the study, both of these strains were grown on fabricated surfaces that varied in structure, with one being uniform or \"unpatterned,\" and the other being \"patterned\" with ridged blocks. Researchers then measured how quickly colonies were able to start communicating with QS while being grown either in the presence of antibiotics or not. QS was detected using mass spectrometry and Raman-imaging, which measured the presence of signaling molecules associated with the behavior.      The first thing researchers noticed was that antibiotics slowed growth of a biofilm and production of QS molecules across both strains and structure types. Next, the researchers found that surface type had a large effect on the non-mucoid strain, in that the patterned structure was associated with longer latencies before expression of QS molecules were at their peak. This was not the case for the thicker mucoid strain.\"While the impact of the antibiotic slowing biofilm growth didn't surprise us, the large and differential impact on surface structure was striking,\" said Sweedler.\"In the non-mucoid strain, surface patterning had a huge impact on the QS signal properties,\" Parmar added. \"In the case of mucoid, the surface structure had very minimal impact on its metabolic signatures.\"The researchers also explored how the distribution of QS signaling molecules differed across different parts of the biofilm when grown on a flat surface and exposed to antibiotics. Samples were taken from the \"static biofilm,\" where the biofilm attaches to the surface, the \"supernatant,\" or liquid medium of the culture, and the \"pellicle biofilm,\" that forms on top of the liquid medium and interacts with the air.Researchers found that the supernatant liquid and pellicle biofilms contained signaling molecules associated with a stress response, while the static biofilm did not contain these molecules. The researchers think this is because the liquid component of the biofilm is what allows bacteria to float along and start new colonies elsewhere, but in the process the bacteria are also exposed to threatening situations, such as presence of antibiotics.By comparing QS behavior during biofilm growth across these different treatments, researchers can better understand how and what kind of molecules this species of bacteria use, and gain new insights on bacterial growth.\"P. aeruginosa biofilm is quite challenging to eradicate using currently available antibiotics, and so our goal with this study was to understand what are the factors that govern the growth and stability of these biofilms, and how bacteria escapes these biofilm structures to colonize new locations,\" explained Parmar.\"The chemically information-rich approaches and analytical techniques we used allowed us to probe these complex molecular events related to biofilm formation across space and time,\" Sweedler explained.The team says the next step is to use these optimized analytical techniques to measure QS signals on lung slices from rats, instead of fabricated structures like those used in the current study. Because P. aeruginosa is often associated with infections in the lungs of CF patients, understanding how it forms biofilms in the lungs can help scientists engineer methods to slow or prevent bacteria growth in these patients.Parmar described one potential future application could be to engineer surfaces of medical devices to deter bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.

  "text": "A research team at POSTECH has successfully synthesized a new hybrid material that effectively captures carbon dioxide and other toxic gases through its porous organic-inorganic structure.          The sparsely-pillared organic-inorganic hybrid compound (SPOIC) was developed through a collaborative effort led by POSTECH professors Jisoon Ihm (Department of Physics), Kilwon Cho, Seok Hwan Park (Department of Chemical Engineering). SPOIC features a myriad of tiny pores that provide a wide surface area; organic and inorganic components that are non-toxic to humans; and a safe, simple, and eco-friendly production process.This material is designed to maximize the interlayer space in the aluminum hydroxide's layered structure by inserting organic molecules with a wide interval between the layers, creating a form that maximizes interlayer space. As a result, the molecules inserted into this space become stably adsorbed or trapped by binding to the inner surfaces of the layers.This material is highly effective in adsorbing, storing, or removing diverse harmful substances, including greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, pollutants like nitrogen oxides that cause particulate matter, and heavy metals and radioactive materials. It can also serve as a versatile platform material for attaching functional groups for specific applications.After developing their latest creation, lead investigator Jisoon Ihm entered the XPRIZE Carbon Removal, an international competition aimed at capturing and removing carbon dioxide. Professor Ihm's team obtained qualification certification to participate and showcase their innovation. The novel material has been featured on various mainstream media outlets in Korea as well.This material has already obtained patents in Korea, Japan, and the United States.Professor Ihm remarked, \"We anticipate this material to be widely used for capturing carbon dioxide and various harmful substances.\" Provided byPohang University of Science and TechnologyCitation:Porous material for selective trapping of carbon dioxide and toxic gases (2023, April 4)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-porous-material-carbon-dioxide-toxic.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Fossil fuel consumption contributes to significant greenhouse gas emissions and severe climate issues. It is imperative to explore sustainable alternatives to the current industrial production of chemicals and fuels. The efficient utilization of lignocellulosic biomass as a substitute for fossil resources is a promising approach to promote the sustainable development of modern society.          Although numerous valorization routes for lignocellulose have been explored, large-scale lignocellulose valorizations are still limited. In this regard, a group of researchers has summarized the catalytic reaction routes, reaction types, and key steps for the selective preparation of various important products from lignocellulose with four panoramic reaction network maps.They also point out the challenges and possible resolving strategies in the lignocellulose valorization processes. This could provide a panoramic view of the related field and facilitate the development of sustainable and efficient lignocellulose-based biorefineries. This review was published in Industrial Chemistry & Materials.\"The valorization of lignocellulose for the production of chemicals or fuels has been the subject of extensive research, which has been comprehensively reviewed by numerous scholars with expertise in the field,\" said corresponding author Ying Zhang, a professor at the University of Science and Technology of China.\"These reviews provide detailed insights into the catalytic performance and mechanisms involved, which can be of great assistance to researchers. However, the large-scale valorization of lignocellulose requires the collaborative efforts of scientists, engineers, economic evaluators, entrepreneurs, and policymakers. Therefore, a more concise and comprehensive panoramic perspective is necessary for individuals who are new to this field but are interested in it.\"\"This review can facilitate the identification of specific converting sections for the preparation of chemicals of interest from biomass, and promote large-scale production. As a result, we have conducted this work to provide a comprehensive and concise overview of the valorization of lignocellulose, which can serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals alike.\"Renewable lignocellulose is a highly versatile resource that can be utilized to produce an array of value-added chemicals. The reaction routes and resulting products are dependent on the raw materials used. \"Drawing on an extensive body of research, we have developed four panoramic reaction network maps that highlight critical steps involved in the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass,\" Zhang said.      The maps provide a detailed overview of the conversions from cellulose to a range of valuable C2 to C6 chemicals, as well as reactions that begin with or involve platform molecules such as 5-hydroxylfurfural (HMF) and furfural, which can be transformed into functional compounds and aviation fuels. The review also covers oxidative and reductive depolymerization of lignin, as well as selective hydrodeoxygenation steps that result in the production of various monomers.\"Through these four maps, we can have a comprehensive understanding of the reactions routes involved in the valorization of lignocellulose,\" Zhang said.But how do we integrate the reaction routes with practical applications? Currently, while a few commercial and semi-commercial products such as furfural, levulinic acid, vanillin, HMF, and FDCA have been successfully derived from lignocellulose or its main components, most research efforts are confined to laboratory settings.\"The concept of an integrated biorefinery can only succeed if the costs of chemicals produced from lignocellulosic biomass are comparable or lower than those from fossil fuels,\" Zhang said.\"Currently, given that much of the biomass valorization research is still in its early stages, the findings are insufficient to conduct techno-economic analysis. A set of metrics addressing resource efficiency (carbon footprint and waste production), catalyst performance (selectivity, activity, and consumption), and product recovery can serve as the initial guideline in evaluating what feedstock, chemistry, and technology deserve further exploitation, or in defining preliminary performance targets which may have the industrial potential.\"The rational design of catalysts is crucial for the valorization of lignocellulose. According to Ying Zhang, a series of challenges must be addressed to successfully synthesize robust and easily regenerated catalysts, accurately design multifunctional catalysts with high activity and selectivity, and gain a thorough understanding of the reaction mechanism. These are key to unlocking the full potential of lignocellulose as a valuable resource.\"The primary objective of this work is to provide readers with a clear understanding of the current research and applications of lignocellulose, while highlighting the challenges that must be overcome. We hope it is helpful to promote the development of innovative solutions that can contribute to the sustainable production of chemicals and fuels through extensive collaboration,\" Zhang said.

  "answer_race": " How to design ultrastable materials.",
  "question_squad": " What is the term for a rigid, cage-like structure?",
  "answer_squad": " metal-organic frameworks",
  "text": "Materials known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have a rigid, cage-like structure that lends itself to a variety of applications, from gas storage to drug delivery. By changing the building blocks that go into the materials, or the way they are arranged, researchers can design MOFs suited to different uses.          However, not all possible MOF structures are stable enough to be deployed for applications such as catalyzing reactions or storing gases. To help researchers figure out which MOF structures might work best for a given application, MIT researchers have developed a computational approach that allows them to predict which structures will be the most stable.Using their computational model, the researchers have identified about 10,000 possible MOF structures that they classify as \"ultrastable,\" making them good candidates for applications such as converting methane gas to methanol.\"When people come up with hypothetical MOF materials, they don't necessarily know beforehand how stable that material is,\" says Heather Kulik, an MIT associate professor of chemistry and chemical engineering, and the senior author of the study.\"We used data and our machine-learning models to come up with building blocks that were expected to have high stability, and when we recombined those in ways that were considerably more diverse, our dataset was enriched with materials with higher stability than any previous set of hypothetical materials people had come up with.\"MIT graduate student Aditya Nandy is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in the journal Matter. Other authors are MIT postdoc Shuwen Yue, graduate students Changhwan Oh and Gianmarco Terrones, Chenru Duan Ph.D. '22, and Yongchul G. Chung, an associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Pusan National University.Modeling MOFsScientists are interested in MOFs because they have a porous structure that makes them well-suited to applications involving gases, such as gas storage, separating similar gases from each other, or converting one gas to another. Recently, scientists have also begun to explore using them to deliver drugs or imaging agents within the body.The two main components of MOFs are secondary building units\u2014organic molecules that incorporate metal atoms such as zinc or copper\u2014and organic molecules called linkers, which connect the secondary building units. These parts can be combined together in many different ways, just like LEGO building blocks, Kulik says.\"Because there are so many different types of LEGO blocks and ways you can assemble them, it gives rise to a combinatorial explosion of different possible metal organic framework materials,\" she says. \"You can really control the overall structure of the metal organic framework by picking and choosing how you assemble different components.\"Currently, the most common way to design MOFs is through trial-and-error. More recently, researchers have begun to try computational approaches to designing these materials. Most such studies have been based on predictions of how well the material will work for a particular application, but they don't always take into account the stability of the resulting material.\"A really good MOF material for catalysis or for gas storage would have a very open structure, but once you have this open structure, it may be really hard to make sure that that material is also stable under long-term use,\" Kulik says.In a 2021 study, Kulik reported a new model that she created by mining a few thousand papers on MOFs to find data on the temperature at which a given MOF would break down and whether particular MOFs can withstand the conditions needed to remove solvents used to synthesize them. She trained the computer model to predict those two features\u2014known as thermal stability and activation stability\u2014based on the molecules' structure.In the new study, Kulik and her students used that model to identify about 500 MOFs with very high stability. Then, they broke those MOFs down into their most common building blocks\u2014120 secondary building units and 16 linkers.By recombining these building blocks using about 750 different types of architectures, including many that are not usually included in such models, the researchers generated about 50,000 new MOF structures.\"One of the things that was unique about our set was that we looked at a lot more diverse crystal symmetries than had ever been looked at before, but [we did so] using these building blocks that had only come from experimentally synthesized highly stable MOFs,\" Kulik says.      UltrastabilityThe researchers then used their computational models to predict how stable each of these 50,000 structures would be, and identified about 10,000 that they deemed ultrastable, both for thermal stability and activation stability.They also screened the structures for their \"deliverable capacity\"\u2014a measure of a material's ability to store and release gases. For this analysis, the researchers used methane gas, because capturing methane could be useful for removing it from the atmosphere or converting it to methanol. They found that the 10,000 ultrastable materials they identified had good deliverable capacities for methane and they were also mechanically stable, as measured by their predicted elastic modulus.\"Designing a MOF requires consideration of many types of stability, but our models enable a near-zero-cost prediction of thermal and activation stability,\" Nandy says. \"By also understanding the mechanical stability of these materials, we provide a new way to identify promising materials.\"The researchers also identified certain building blocks that tend to produce more stable materials. One of the secondary building units with the best stability was a molecule that contains gadolinium, a rare-earth metal. Another was a cobalt-containing porphyrin\u2014a large organic molecule made of four interconnected rings.Students in Kulik's lab are now working on synthesizing some of these MOF structures and testing them in the lab for their stability and potential catalytic ability and gas separation ability. The researchers have also made their database of ultrastable materials available for researchers interested in testing them for their own scientific applications. More information:Heather J.

  "text": "A team of chemists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Chemistry has developed a process for dramatically improving the efficiency of bacterial production of a commercial polypeptide. Their paper is published in the journal Science Advances.          Microbes have been used to produce natural products for several decades, but in many cases, yields are too low for mass production. So chemists have been looking for ways to improve yields using symbiotic characteristics between microbes. In this new effort, the research team took advantage of different characteristics of three types of bacteria to create an environment that would produce a commercially desirable polypeptide\u2014and then they added a conductive copolymer to improve efficiency even more.The work started with the bacteria Bacillus licheniformis, which lives in soil. It has a natural ability to make \u03b3-polyglutamic acid (\u03b3-PGA), a useful polypeptide. They then added cyanobacteria to fix carbon in the air and to use it via photosynthesis to produce a carbohydrate. Next, they added Rhodopseudomonas palustris\u2014bacteria that can convert nitrogen in the air into ammonium.The result was a mixture of bacteria that together could produce \u03b3-PGA much more efficiently than any known natural method alone, using only solar power, airborne carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Still, the researchers knew the process could be improved. They added a conductive copolymer that allowed the mix of bacteria to form a network of sorts, which made the process of producing \u03b3-PGA both more stable and more efficient.The process produced an increase in yield by approximately 104% over other natural methods. It also improved photosynthetic efficiency from 0.71 to 1.43%. The team also tweaked the system to make it produce bacitracin A and found it increased yields over other natural methods by approximately 77%. The research group notes that the process is also low-cost and easily scaled up to manufacturing standards. They conclude that their process also serves as a proof of concept, opening the door to the development of similar processes using different ingredients to make different end products.

  "text": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been gaining attention as promising carbon-neutral porous materials, thanks to their high performance in gas storage, separation, and conversion. The geometric building blocks of MOFs, metal clusters and organic linkers, allow chemists to predict and synthesize new structures like assembling LEGO. However, finding new metal building blocks is still a daunting challenge due to the complex nature of metal ions in synthesis.          A research team, led by Professor Wonyoung Choe at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), South Korea, was inspired by the molecular metal clusters previously synthesized before realized in porous materials. This implies one can predict future MOFs by looking closely at their metal building blocks.The research team compared zirconium metal clusters found in both MOFs and molecules. Zirconium-based MOFs are one of the representative metal-organic porous materials with remarkable stability and a broad range of applications. The researchers identified seven types of zirconium building blocks in MOFs and discovered additional fourteen types of potential metal building blocks.The research team provided a library of those various molecular clusters for future metal building blocks of MOFs, and suggested practical synthetic strategies. This research is expected to greatly accelerate the discovery of new MOFs by presenting metal cluster candidates whose structures were previously difficult to predict.\"Zirconium metal clusters feature outstanding molecular adsorptive and catalytic properties depending on their structures. Very excited to see what properties the new zirconium cluster will show,\" said Dr. Dongsik Nam, the first author of the study.\"This research can be extended to various metal clusters in MOFs beyond zirconium,\" noted Professor Wonyoung Choe. \"New metal building blocks will provide a big hint to accelerate the discovery of future carbon-neutral porous materials.\"The findings of this research have been published in Trends in Chemistry.

  "text": "A recent study in the Journal of Biological Chemistry revealed the key to a protein that commonly causes blindness. The biological process involves a protein that is essential for transporting toxic compounds out of the eye, similar to a garbage recycling service. The challenge is that, like food and the waste it generates, these compounds are essential for the eye to function properly\u2014until they build up and cause blindness.          The scientists behind the study research a protein transporter, called ABCA4, that lines the edges of specialized photoreceptor cells in the retina and is normally poised to remove toxic, fatty retinal byproducts called N-Ret-PE. Retinal is a derivative of vitamin A, which is found in foods such as leafy green vegetables.\"Retinal is critical for vision,\" said Robert Molday, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of British Columbia who oversaw the work. \"But, it's also potentially very toxic because it has a very reactive element. So, cells have to be able to balance between using retinal for sustained vision as well as managing its toxicity.\"Mutations in ABCA4 can cause N-Ret-PE buildup, which leads to vision loss in diseases such as Stargardt disease. Stargardt disease is the most common inherited form of macular degeneration and affects approximately 30,000 people nationwide. There is currently no therapy or cure for the disease.The researchers were interested in finding out how the ABCA4 transporter malfunctions to cause vision loss. They found that a portion of the protein that interacts with N-Ret-PE, known as the binding pocket, is inert in some patients with Stargardt disease. Therefore, the toxic compounds slip out of the ABCA4 transporter and cannot be removed from the retina.Next, by changing the makeup of ABCA4, the researchers showed they could mimic the effect of the Stargardt mutations.\"We were able to elucidate the mechanism of binding, which paves the way for treatments for Stargardt disease,\" Tongzhou Xu, a postdoctoral fellow at UBC and lead author of the study, said.The team is optimistic that one day there will be a targeted therapeutic for patients with Stargardt disease that may use gene therapy and specialized particles for delivery to the eye. Gene therapy approaches have already been successfully used to correct mutations in a similar transporter, which causes cystic fibrosis.\"We are now applying two types of technologies to alter ABCA4,\" Molday said. \"One which was developed to specifically correct the DNA with gene-editing approaches. We are coupling that with lipid nanoparticles, which have been used in the COVID-19 vaccine to encapsulate mRNA. So, by combining these two technologies, we envision being able to potentially correct the defects in individuals with Stargardt's disease that have specific point mutations.\" More information:Tongzhou Xu et al, Retinal-phospholipid Schiff-base conjugates and their interaction with ABCA4, the ABC transporter associated with Stargardt Disease, Journal of Biological Chemistry (2023).

There are specific points along the polymer chain of these compounds where the sense of the helix changes, which are difficult to identify in solution.          Employing photochemical methods, Center for Research in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Materials (CiQUS) researchers have now determined not only the presence of these helix reversals in polymer solution but also to estimated its folding degree. The results has been recently published in Nature Communications.Most of the functions performed by biological molecules such as proteins, peptides or DNA are determined by their three-dimensional conformation. In helical polymers, the structure-function relationship can affect their different applications: misfolding may cause their functionality disappear.Considering the polymer folding degree in solution can determine if the compound is well folded or presents a poorly folded structure that will badly affect to its potential applications. \"The most serious limitation when working with these macromolecules is the determination of their degree of folding. That is, to determine if the whole material is folded as a helix, or if some areas remain unfolded,\" explains Felix Freire, coauthor of the study and principal investigator at CiQUS.\"Furthermore, identifying the direction in which the helices rotate is key to determining the structure-function relationship of these materials.\"In this work, a team led by Prof. Freire and Prof. Qui\u00f1oa at CiQUS has developed a methodology for quantifying the folding degree of helical polymers. Through a photochemical electrocyclization process, the study conducted by Dr. Francisco Rey and Dr. Rafael Rodr\u00edguez consisted of unfolding the material to understand how it was folded.

  "text": "The health and environmental harms of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are well-known, but a new study calls into question their touted stain-fighting benefits. The study, published today in the AATCC Journal of Research, tested the performance of PFAS finishings on furniture fabrics and found that they had limited to no effectiveness, particularly under real-world conditions.          \"It was surprising that these harmful but supposedly indispensable chemicals had no practical benefit,\" said lead author Jonas LaPier, a Ph.D. candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. \"It makes you wonder what other uses of PFAS are also unnecessary and could be easily eliminated from products without noticeable change in performance.\"Using droplets of coffee and oil-based salad dressing, the researchers tested six PFAS-finished and three non-PFAS-finished fabrics used for indoor commercial furniture. For water-based coffee stains, none of the PFAS-finished fabrics performed better than the unfinished fabrics. The stains were minimal and easily removed from finished and unfinished fabrics alike. Only fabric type (e.g., polyester vs. cotton/nylon, patterned vs. unpatterned, light vs. dark, etc.) affected coffee stain performance.For oil-based stains, some PFAS-finished fabrics showed minimal improvements over unfinished fabrics; however, the performance differences between fabric types were much larger than from PFAS finishes. Further, any repellency provided by the finishes were quickly lost with abrasion, meaning that the benefits would be lost as soon as the furniture is worn with use.Exposures to PFAS from furniture occur during the manufacture, use, and disposal of finished fabrics, generating health risks for workers, consumers, and communities living near production sites as well as environmental harm.Some PFAS have been associated with a wide range of serious health harms, from cancer to obesity to more severe COVID-19 outcomes, and they contaminate the drinking water of many millions. Only a small fraction of the thousands of PFAS have been tested for toxicity, and all PFAS are either extremely persistent in the environment or break down into extremely persistent PFAS. Additionally, some newer PFAS first claimed to be safe have been determined later to be harmful to our health.\"PFAS are a public health nightmare and should only be used when essential,\" said Carol Kwiatkowski, co-author and scientist at the Green Science Policy Institute. \"In the case of these fabrics, they aren't delivering the desired performance of stain repellency, and like lipstick or car wax, they get reapplied, which introduces more PFAS into the environment and increases the risk of human exposure. There's simply no justification for continuing to use them in furniture.\"\"The results of the study align with what I've seen first-hand,\" said co-author Betsy Phillips, Director of Environmental Initiatives of the textile company Maharam. \"The presence of PFAS-based finishes doesn't prevent textiles from staining, especially after the finishes have become worn with use. The best way to prevent staining is to promptly clean up spills. When prompt cleaning isn't possible, choosing a thicker, darker, patterned fabric will help mask any stains that may permeate. Beyond staining, omitting PFAS is simply better for our health.\" More information:Jonas LaPier et al, Evaluating the Performance of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Finishes on Upholstery Fabrics, AATCC Journal of Research (2023).

  "text": "In the United States alone, drug-resistant bacteria and fungi infect almost 3 million people per year and kill about 35,000. Antibiotics are essential and effective, but in recent years overuse has led to some bacteria developing resistance to them. The infections are so difficult to treat, the World Health Organization deemed antibiotic resistance a top 10 global public health threat.          Now, Professor John E. Moses at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) has created a new weapon against these drug-resistant superbugs\u2014an antibiotic that can shape-shift by rearranging its atoms.Moses came up with the idea of shape-shifting antibiotics while observing tanks in military training exercises. With rotating turrets and nimble movements, the tanks could respond quickly to possible threats.A few years later, Moses learned of a molecule called bullvalene. Bullvalene is a fluxional molecule, meaning its atoms can swap positions. This gives it a changing shape with over a million possible configurations\u2014exactly the fluidity Moses was looking for.Several bacteria, including MRSA, VRSA, and VRE, have developed resistance to a potent antibiotic called vancomycin, used to treat everything from skin infections to meningitis. Moses thought he could improve the drug's bacteria-fighting performance by combining it with bullvalene.He turned to click chemistry, a Nobel Prize\u2013winning class of fast, high-yielding chemical reactions that \"click\" molecules together reliably. This makes the reactions more efficient for wide-scale use.\"Click chemistry is great,\" says Moses, who studied this revolutionary development under two-time Nobel laureate K. Barry Sharpless. \"It gives you certainty and the best chance you've got of making complex things.\"Using this technique, Moses and his colleagues created a new antibiotic with two vancomycin \"warheads\" and a fluctuating bullvalene center.Moses tested the new drug in collaboration with Dr. Tatiana Soares da-Costa (University of Adelaide). The researchers gave the drug to VRE-infected wax moth larvae, which are commonly used to test antibiotics. They found the shape-shifting antibiotic significantly more effective than vancomycin at clearing the deadly infection. Additionally, the bacteria didn't develop resistance to the new antibiotic.Researchers can use click chemistry with shape-shifting antibiotics to create a multitude of new drugs, Moses explains.

  "text": "99.5% of combustible ice is methane, making it an important reserve energy source. It is inferred that the reserves of combustible ice in the South China Sea amount to the equivalent of at least 80 billion tons of oil.          Current mining methods will lead to the gasification of the combustible ice during the decompression process, which poses a great challenge for the storage and transportation of methane gas. If the methane can be converted into liquid products offshore, it will provide a new prospect for the utilization of combustible ice.In light of that, a team led by Prof. Xiong Yujie and Prof. Long Ran from the University of Science and Technology (USTC) developed an efficient photocatalytic methane halogenation technology using only light, methane and seawater, the products of which can further transform into methanol and  pharmaceutical intermediates. Their work was published in Nature Communications.As a type of versatile platform molecule, methyl halides are widely used in the production of high value-added chemicals and fuels such as methanol, acetic acid and propylene. However, the current synthesis of methyl halides usually involves corrosive feedstocks such as chlorine and hydrogen bromide and harsh reaction conditions, which not only requires complex processes and huge energy consumption, but also poses potential threat to the environment.The research team designed a copper-doped titania catalysis and used widely available alkali halides as halogenation agent to achieve efficient synthesis of methyl halides under light with production rate reaching 1 mmol h-1m-2. This method takes advantage of the offshore light and seawater conditions to efficiently convert methane into chloromethane, verifying the practicability of photocatalytic methane chlorination technology in the utilization of combustible ice.Based on this technology, the team designed a tandem reaction device to synthesize methanol and pharmaceutical intermediates with methane. This work blazes a trail for the exploitation of combustible ice and the conversion from methane to high value-added chemical products.

  "text": "In certain molecules, the so-called photoacids, a proton can be released locally by excitation with light. There is a sudden change in the pH value in the solution\u2014a kind of fast switch that is important for many chemical and biological processes. Until now, however, it was still unclear what happens at the moment of proton release. This is exactly what researchers in the Cluster of Excellence Ruhr Explores Solvation RESOLV at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, have now been able to observe in an experiment using new technology.          They observed a beating between solute and solvent initiating a tiny quake, lasting only three to five picoseconds, before the proton starts to detach. They report on this in the journal Chemical Sciences.So far, the focus has been on dye or baseOne of the most studied so-called photoacids is pyranine, the fluorescent dye used, for instance, in yellow highlighters. \"Despite a wealth of experimental studies, the process that is at the very beginning of proton detachment still remained the subject of controversial debate,\" reports Professor Martina Havenith, spokesperson for RESOLV. However, the entire detachment process also happens on a time scale of only 90 picoseconds. A picosecond corresponds to a millionth of a millionth of a second.While previous studies focused mainly on the change of the dye after light excitation, the team was able to observe the change of the solvent, in this case water, during this process for the first time. This was achieved with the help of a newly developed technique, \"Optical Pump THz Probe Spectroscopy.\"Ultra-fast energy transmission\"We were able to follow how there is an oscillation at the beginning, which then subsides subsequently,\" describes Martina Havenith. \"It is exciting to see that the solvent response that promotes excited-state proton transfer could be caught in the act.\" The initial ultrafast transfer of energy within less than a picosecond causes a restructuring of the water molecules in the immediate vicinity and opens the way for the subsequent proton migration.The detection was made possible by the new laser laboratories in the ZEMOS research building. There, all external interference signals, such as those caused by electromagnetic radiation, temperature and humidity fluctuations, are minimized. Only then is it possible to detect even the tiniest tremors in a water jet with the dye.

  "question_squad": " What is the most important factor in determining the luminescence properties of RTP materials?",
  "answer_squad": " temperature",
  "text": "Organic materials with room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission have attracted extensive attention due to extraordinary properties including long lifetime, large Stokes shift, stimuli-responsiveness, and so on, and show bright prospects in broad fields. However, the energy of the excited state of organic phosphors is easily consumed through thermal radiation and collision deactivation.          Therefore, numerous design strategies such as creating a rigid environment through crystallization and supramolecular assembly are employed to improve the luminescent characteristics of RTP materials by restricting nonradiative transition, enhancing intersystem crossing, and so forth.A team of scientists summarizes the recent progress of organic RTP materials from the perspective of practical applications including luminescence and display, environmental detection, and bioimaging. Based on their works, the requirements of organic RTP materials for different applications are summarized, which may bring enlightenment to the future application research of RTP materials. This review was published in the journal Industrial Chemistry & Materials.Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have shown excellent performance on display screens recently, while only 25% of singlet excitons in fluorescent materials can be utilized to emit light. Therefore, the harvesting of singlet excitons and triplex excitons to achieve 100% theoretical internal quantum efficiency makes phosphorescent materials attractive.\"Relevant scientific researchers have designed many organic light-emitting diodes based on RTP with high external quantum efficiency by using different strategies, which far exceeds the 5% theoretical limit for typical fluorescent materials,\" said Ma, a professor at East China University of Science and Technology, China.Due to UV irradiation and the different lifetime of RTP emission, anti-counterfeiting or data encryption based on RTP materials has become a common and popular application. In addition to simple anti-counterfeiting and data encryption based on the on-off of UV light, the different lifetimes of RTP materials provide a feasible way to realize multiple anti-counterfeiting or data encryption by using time resolution techniques.Besides, the chemical-responsive RTP is also a potential means to realize multiple anti-counterfeiting. In addition to the applications above, RTP materials have also been studied for two rare but meaningful applications, printing, and visualization of latent fingerprints, due to their unique luminous properties.      \"As we all know, many factors affect the luminescence properties of RTP materials, such as oxygen, temperature, and so on,\" Ma said. \"So chemical sensors based on RTP are also an indispensable research direction, which can produce practical applications in environmental detection.\"The spin triplet property of ground state oxygen makes it easy for O2 to quench the triplet excitons of RTP materials, which makes RTP materials ideal candidates for O2 detection. Generally, the decreasing phosphorescent intensity and lifetime can both be utilized to realize quantitative detection of oxygen.Temperature is also a significant external environmental factor to affect RTP emission because the high temperature will enhance nonradiative transition, and thus the corresponding RTP materials are developed for temperature sensing. In addition, the quenching effect of small organic molecules on RTP emission makes chemical sensors based on RTP materials possible.Optical imaging plays an important role in biomedical and clinical research. Compared with fluorescence, RTP has a longer lifetime at a longer wavelength which is beneficial to eliminate fluorescence background interference and scattered light and gain a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SBR). Although RTP materials have many advantages in bioimaging, non-radiative decay and quenchers in aqueous solutions seriously hinder their practical application.Researchers innovatively proposed a supramolecular self-assembly strategy and top-down nanoparticle formulation to achieve stable phosphorescence at room temperature in an aqueous solution. Therefore, the researchers not only successfully constructed near-infrared phosphorescent materials with high resolution and deep penetration, but also developed RTP materials with long-wavelength excitation and phosphorescent emission simultaneously, effectively avoiding the damage of ultraviolet light to organisms.These works show huge potential application value in biological imaging.Although organic room temperature phosphorescent materials constructed by different strategies are widely used in various fields due to different luminescence properties, there is still huge research space to fabricate more excellent applied RTP materials. Therefore, the team also discusses how to overcome the challenges and the prospect of phosphorescent materials.To obtain efficient organic light-emitting diodes, phosphorescent materials need to meet the characteristics of high quantum yield and short lifetime, while RTP materials for anti-counterfeiting and encryption often require rich luminous colors and perform differently with UV excitation. And the application in biological imaging demands RTP materials to have longer wavelengths and lifetime to eliminate fluorescence background interference and gain a higher signal-to-noise ratio.Moreover, the application scope should be broadened due to the extraordinary optical properties of RTP materials. Further exploration of RTP materials will not only contribute to a deeper understanding of photoluminescence but promote the practical application of photoelectric functional materials in our life.

  "answer_squad": " CENP-E",
  "text": "Anticancer drugs are pivotal to cancer treatment, but their toxicity may not always be limited to cancer cells, resulting in harmful side-effects. To develop anticancer therapies that have fewer adverse effects on patients, scientists are now focusing on molecules that are less toxic to cells.          One such group of drugs is the \"kinesin inhibitors.\" These inhibitors prevent cancer progression by explicitly targeting kinesin motor proteins, which are required for the division of cancer cells. Centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E), a member of the kinesin motor protein, is a promising target for inhibitor therapy, as it is essential for tumor cell replication. However, determining the structure of CENP-E is crucial to identify inhibitor molecules that can bind to CENP-E and arrest the function.Interestingly, the binding of the energy molecule\u2014adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\u2014to the motor domain of CENP-E changes its structure or configuration. This also occurs when CENP-E binds to an inhibitor. So far, very few CENP-E inhibitors have been reported and none have been approved for clinical use. It is, therefore, important to acquire structural information on the CENP-E motor domain.To this end, a research team from Tokyo University of Science (TUS) in Japan used X-ray crystallography to elucidate the crystal structure of the complex formed by the CENP-E motor domain and a kinesin inhibitor.The study, which was led by Professor Hideshi Yokoyama from TUS, along with co-authors Ms. Asuka Shibuya from TUS, and Assistant Professor Naohisa Ogo, Associate Professor Jun-ichi Sawada, and Professor Akira Asai from the University of Shizuoka, was published in FEBS Letters.\"CENP-E selectively acts on dividing cells, making it a potential new target for anticancer drugs with fewer side-effects,\" says Dr. Yokoyama while discussing the motivation underlying this study.First, the team expressed the CENP-E motor domain in bacterial cells, following which they purified and mixed it with adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP)\u2014a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue. The mix was crystallized to obtain exhaustive X-ray data. Using this data, the team obtained the structure of CENP-E motor domain-AMPPNP complex.Next, they compared the structure with that of CENP-E-bound adenosine diphosphate (CENP-E-MgADP) as well as with other previously known kinesin motor protein-AMPPNP complexes. From these comparisons, the team speculated that the helix alpha 4 in the motor domain was likely to be responsible for the loose binding of CENP-E to microtubules, i.e., cell structures that are crucial to cell division.\"Compared to the \u03b14 helices of other kinesins, the \u03b14 of CENP-E binds slowly and with lesser strength to microtubules as compared to other kinesins, throughout the ATP hydrolysis cycle,\" adds Dr. Yokoyama.The discovery of the crystal structure of the complex is expected to facilitate additional structure-activity relationship studies, which will bring scientists a step closer to developing anticancer drugs targeting CENP-E. The research team is optimistic about the future applications of their research and are confident that it will be possible to design drugs based on the methods employed in this study.\"The ultimate goal is to use the preparation and crystallization methods described in our study for future drug design studies that aim at developing anticancer drugs with fewer side-effects,\" concludes a hopeful Dr. Yokoyama.

  "text": "2D materials get their strength from their atom-thin, sheet like structure. However, stacking multiple layers of a 2D material will sap it of the qualities that make it so useful.          Rice University materials scientist Jun Lou and collaborators at the University of Maryland showed that fine-tuning interlayer interactions in a class of 2D polymers known as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can determine the materials' loss or retention of desirable mechanical properties in multilayer or bulk form. In the process, the researchers engineered a lightweight material with high stiffness and strength that preserves its 2D properties even as a multilayer stack, according to a study published in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The finding is a first step toward enabling the use of 2D polymers in large-scale multifunctional applications where mechanical properties are important and could open the door to new high-performance filtration systems, carbon capture and energy storage technologies.\"This to us is a very exciting starting point,\" Lou said. \"A really nice thing about COFs and other 2D polymers is that you have a lot of chemistry knobs you can tune. This means you can rationally engineer the interlayer interactions. Essentially, you can make very strong modular systems using interlayer interaction design.\"Researchers looked at how two COFs with very similar structures behave when multiple layers were stacked together and found that a small difference in their structure led to completely different patterns of interlayer interaction.\"In order to successfully design COFs with desirable interlayer interactions you need scientific insight into the material structures of COFs,\" said Teng Li, a professor of mechanical engineering at Maryland. \"To this end, we rely on first-principles simulations of the COF materials at the molecular scale to offer crucial design guidelines.\"Qiyi Fang, a Rice alum and co-lead author on the study, said the Rice lab designed two types of COFs based on the scientific insight from the simulations developed by colleagues at Maryland.\"One of the COFs, like most 2D materials, does not have a very strong interlayer interaction, and the strength and elasticity of the material decreases with the number of layers added,\" Fang said. \"The other COF, however, exhibits strong interlayer interaction and retains its good mechanical properties even with the addition of multiple layers.\"      Maryland researcher and co-lead author Zhenqian Pang said the simulations helped pinpoint why the two COFs behaved differently.\"We found that the strong interlayer interaction in the latter COF results from the significantly enhanced hydrogen bonding among its special functional groups,\" Pang said.The fact that strong interactions between the 2D-material layers correlate with the persistence of desirable mechanical properties in the material's multilayer or bulk form gives researchers a clue about what it takes to make a bulk-layered material that retains the mechanical properties of its 2D counterpart.\"We believe this strong interlayer interaction is primarily due to the chemistry of the hydrogen bond,\" Lou said. \"Hydrogen bonds are universal and occur in many systems. In our study, we show that those hydrogen bonds between layers are not only quite strong, but also dynamic in the sense that if they break under stress, they reform as the layers slide over one another.\"Facilitating stronger bonds between 2D-material layers can weaken the bonds connecting the atoms within a layer.\"Interlayer interaction-tuning is possible in other 2D materials, but what generally happens is you're going to sacrifice the strong in-plane bonding environment of those 2D materials in order to have those functional groups attached,\" Lou said. \"So it's actually a trade-off. With 2D polymers, you don't necessarily have to have that trade-off. That's one of the very important motivations for taking this direction in our research.\"A 2D polymer is made up of identical atom groupings with linking elements\u2014the functional groups\u2014along each of its edges.\"The 2D polymer is a sort of designer system, in the sense that it's very tunable,\" Lou said.In previous research on 2D materials, Lou and collaborators had shown hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was 10 times more resistant to fracture than graphene.\"Like in graphene or h-BN, you still have this hexagonal lattice structure\u2014six atoms in a hexagon pattern that you repeat indefinitely,\" Lou said. \"But for the 2D polymer, you also have a linker or nodal unit, which makes that hexagon larger.\"A larger repeat element means the material is less dense.\"This COF is nearly 10 times less dense than graphene or h-BN,\" Fang said. \"As a result, the specific strength and specific stiffness of the COF are among the highest reported.\"\"This is significant because if we can show that this 2D material is as fracture-resistant as h-BN, it is also significantly lighter,\" Lou added. \"When you want greater strength without increasing the weight of your structure, this can be useful.\"This finding relates to some of the more application-driven ideas,\" he said. \"COFs could make excellent filtration membranes, for instance. Now we have a way to design very strong, very fracture-resistant, multilayer 2D polymers that could be very good candidates for membrane filtration applications.\"Lou said another potential application is for upgrading energy storage.\"We've already explored COF functionality for optimizing lithium-ion battery performance, and this shows we're on the right track,\" he said. \"For all these applications, 2D polymers' mechanical properties\u2014especially in terms of fracture resistance\u2014are very important.\"According to Li, the study's key insight is that \"tuning secondary intermolecular bonding is an effective materials-design strategy that could enable the development of an array of new materials with enhanced properties.\"\"This is distinct from the conventional materials design methods that rely largely on primary bonding,\" he said. \"There are fertile opportunities to design materials with this new strategy.\" More information:Fang, Qiyi et al, Superior mechanical properties of multilayer covalent-organic frameworks enabled by rationally tuning molecular interlayer interactions, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

  "text": "Research conducted at University of Limerick in Ireland has shown that crystal engineering can improve access to a drug used in the treatment of a tropical disease affecting millions worldwide.          The study investigated the potential benefits of an underexplored crystal engineering strategy to improve the properties of crystalline drugs, which in turn would improve drug absorption in the human system.The strategy was tested on a drug used for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease that affects over 250 million people worldwide.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identify schistosomiasis as second only to malaria as the most devastating parasitic disease.The research was led by Dr. Matteo Lusi, a Lecturer in Crystallography at University of Limerick, who is a researcher in the Bernal Institute in the Faculty of Science and Engineering, along with colleagues in UL, Italy, and Switzerland.The findings, which could have a significant impact in making medicine more soluble and palatable for children, have just been published in the Molecular Pharmaceutics journal.Praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug of choice for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease that affects 250 million people worldwide.Due to its low solubility and high permeability, a high dose is required\u2014particularly in children\u2014and the large volume makes it difficult to swallow, which decreases patience compliance and causes many cases to be untreated.While smaller dose forms are currently in development, they are considerably more expensive\u2014meaning that cheaper strategies to dose reduction using a more soluble form with increased absorption would be desirable.\"This work demonstrates that a solid solution could increase the solubility of the drug by up to eight times and its absorption in vivo\u2014or in the body\u2014which is key to greater efficacy and reduced side effects for the patients,\" explained Dr. Lusi.The results were obtained through a simple crystal modification with relatively low development and manufacturing costs, Dr. Lusi explained.\"As a proof of principle, we have focused on an essential drug for the treatment of a parasite that is common in tropical and undeveloped countries, many which cannot afford expensive medicines.\"Our approach is also a more general one that can be applied to any crystalline drug forms. This is also critical to achieving UN Sustainable Development grand challenges in good health and well-being,\" Dr. Lusi added.Dr. Lusi, a lecturer in UL's Department of Chemical Sciences and author of over 70 publications who is also the former director of the International School of Crystallography Erice, Italy, has said the goal of his research in this area \"is to understand how molecules and ions interact in the solid state or crystals and how molecular and ionic interactions translate into tangible chemical and physical properties.\"\"Ideally such knowledge can help create new crystalline materials with predetermined properties and functions.\"Dr. Lusi's research has investigated a little-known ability of molecules, which behave in a crystal as they do in a liquid form, in that they move, react together, and mix freely to create solutions.\"Crystalline materials are present in most drugs, and agrichemicals. In this sense there is already a considerable interest from pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and agrichemical companies to produce better products that are more stable, bioavailable, easier to produce and administer,\" the UL researcher explained.\"Such products will also have lower side effects and environmental footprint,\" Dr. Lusi added.

  "answer_squad": " intestinal microbiome",
  "text": "The intestinal microbiome, i.e., the community of bacteria and other microorganisms that live in the human gut, has been shown to affect the metabolism and the immune system. We still do not fully understand how the symbiosis between a healthy microbiome and the host is regulated and how bacterial overgrowth with pathogenic germs can be prevented.          A research team led by Professor Christoph Becker-Pauly from the Institute of Biochemistry at Kiel University (CAU) in collaboration with other working groups has now discovered an important mechanism influencing the intestinal microbiome in mouse models. The results were recently published in the journal Science Advances.\"For the first time, we were able to show that a complex of the enzymes meprin \u03b1 and meprin \u03b2 located on intestinal cells influences the microbiome composition by processing the substrate galectin-3,\" explained first author Cynthia B\u00fclck, Ph.D. student at the CAU's Institute of Biochemistry.\"The activity of this enzyme complex is in turn directly influenced by the microbiome,\" added Professor Christoph Becker-Pauly, member of the Cluster of Excellence \"Precision Medicine in Chronic Inflammation\" (PMI) and head of the Unit for Degradomics of the Protease Web. \"This means that the microbiome influences host proteins, which in turn influence the microbiome.\"The researchers studied this interplay of regulation of the enzyme complex in mouse models with different bacterial colonizations.Enzymatic cleavage influences binding to bacteriaThe research focused on the protein-cleaving enzymes meprin \u03b1 and meprin \u03b2, which are strongly expressed in healthy intestine and are significantly downregulated in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). \"On the one hand, we wanted to elucidate the function of meprins in the small and large intestine, and on the other hand, we wanted to understand how the composition of bacteria in the intestine is fundamentally regulated,\" said B\u00fclck.Meprin proteases are found throughout the entire intestine, but they are not typical digestive enzymes. \"In previous studies, we were already able to show that these enzymes are responsible for constant detachment and renewing of the mucus layer that protects the small intestinal epithelium,\" said Becker-Pauly.In order to clarify the further functions of meprins, which exist as the meprin \u03b1/\u03b2 complex in the large intestine, the researchers first employed a mass spectrometry-based method to search for substrates that are processed by this enzyme complex. \"We identified galectin-3 as an important substrate in the large intestine,\" stated Becker-Pauly.Galectin-3 is permanently produced in the intestinal villi. It is found both within the cells but also outside the cell in the mucus layer and can interact with bacteria, for example by agglutination. Proteolytic cleavage of galectin-3 by meprin \u03b1/\u03b2 resulted in altered bacterial binding properties. At the same time, depending on the bacterial composition, enzymatic processing of galectin-3 changes. \"This means that depending on how many and which bacteria are present, it also has an influence on how much galectin-3 is enzymatically processed,\" explained B\u00fclck. \"The host responds to the microbiome via the cleavage of galectin-3, which is then modulated differently.\"The work also showed that the enzymatic cleavage of galectin-3 leads to strong agglutination (clumping) and elimination of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a germ that is responsible for about 10% of all hospital infections in Germany.      Key role in microbiome homeostasis\"Understanding the physiological role of this enzyme complex in the intestine could provide new insights into the development of diseases as well as new ways to prevent and treat intestinal diseases,\" emphasized Becker-Pauly. In chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, not only the enzyme complex is reduced, but also the substrate galectin-3 is also downregulated. \"This may lead to an imbalance of the the intestinal microbiome so that pathogens can spread more easily,\" suspects the Kiel biochemist. This constellation is certainly not decisive for the development of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, as many factors play a role in this regard, but it should be considered.Further research will now focus on elucidating the mechanisms in more detail that lead to the agglutination of certain types of bacteria. In addition, further immunomodulatory substrates of the meprin \u03b1/\u03b2 complex have been identified and their function will now be analyzed.

However, the design of (nRExi)2Si2O7 materials remains a crucial challenge, due to the versatile combinations of multiple RE elements, as well as the complex polymorphic phase competitions during materials fabrication.In a study recently published in Nature Communications, researchers from the Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, have uncovered the mechanisms of phase formation capability for multicomponent/high-entropy rare-earth disilicate materials and proposed a compositional design strategy.The researchers synthesized 21 multicomponent (REI0.25REII0.25REIII0.25REIV0.25)Si2O7 (RE = Y, La, Ce, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu). They found that the phase formation and stabilization of these materials was dependent on the average RE3+ radius as well as the deviations (\u03c3r) of different RE3+ combinations.Based on high-throughput density-functional-theory simulations, the researchers constructed ensembles containing several hundreds of representative configurations for model compositions, and calculated the configurational entropy mixing.They proposed an entropy descriptor, which captures whether the configurational randomness brought by multiple RE3+ cations can be sufficiently accommodated in the crystal lattice, and thus can be used to predict the phase formation capability of (nRExi)2SI2O7 materials.Based on these findings, the researchers proposed a strategy to design (nRExi)2SI2O7 materials with controlled phase formation capability and high-temperature stability, which leads to efficient design and synthesis of many new (nRExi)2SI2O7 (n = 2, 5, 6; equal and non-equal molar fraction of RE) materials.

  "text": "With the release of platforms like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, diffusion generative models have achieved mainstream popularity, owing to their ability to generate a series of absurd, breathtaking, and often meme-worthy images from text prompts like \"teddy bears working on new AI research on the moon in the 1980s.\"          But a team of researchers at MIT's Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health (Jameel Clinic) thinks there could be more to diffusion generative models than just creating surreal images\u2014they could accelerate the development of new drugs and reduce the likelihood of adverse side effects.A paper introducing this new molecular docking model, called DiffDock, will be presented at the 11th International Conference on Learning Representations. The model's unique approach to computational drug design is a paradigm shift from current state-of-the-art tools that most pharmaceutical companies use, presenting a major opportunity for an overhaul of the traditional drug development pipeline.Drugs typically function by interacting with the proteins that make up our bodies, or proteins of bacteria and viruses. Molecular docking was developed to gain insight into these interactions by predicting the atomic 3D coordinates with which a ligand (i.e., drug molecule) and protein could bind together.While molecular docking has led to the successful identification of drugs that now treat HIV and cancer, with each drug averaging a decade of development time and 90 percent of drug candidates failing costly clinical trials (most studies estimate average drug development costs to be around $1 billion to over $2 billion per drug), it's no wonder that researchers are looking for faster, more efficient ways to sift through potential drug molecules.Currently, most molecular docking tools used for in-silico drug design take a \"sampling and scoring\" approach, searching for a ligand \"pose\" that best fits the protein pocket. This time-consuming process evaluates a large number of different poses, then scores them based on how well the ligand binds to the protein.In previous deep-learning solutions, molecular docking is treated as a regression problem. In other words, \"it assumes that you have a single target that you're trying to optimize for and there's a single right answer,\" says Gabriele Corso, co-author and second-year MIT Ph.D. student in electrical engineering and computer science who is an affiliate of the MIT Computer Sciences and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).      \"With generative modeling, you assume that there is a distribution of possible answers\u2014this is critical in the presence of uncertainty.\"\"Instead of a single prediction as previously, you now allow multiple poses to be predicted, and each one with a different probability,\" adds Hannes St\u00e4rk, co-author and first-year MIT Ph.D. student in electrical engineering and computer science who is an affiliate of the MIT Computer Sciences and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). As a result, the model doesn't need to compromise in attempting to arrive at a single conclusion, which can be a recipe for failure.To understand how diffusion generative models work, it is helpful to explain them based on image-generating diffusion models. Here, diffusion models gradually add random noise to a 2D image through a series of steps, destroying the data in the image until it becomes nothing but grainy static. A neural network is then trained to recover the original image by reversing this noising process. The model can then generate new data by starting from a random configuration and iteratively removing the noise.In the case of DiffDock, after being trained on a variety of ligand and protein poses, the model is able to successfully identify multiple binding sites on proteins that it has never encountered before. Instead of generating new image data, it generates new 3D coordinates that help the ligand find potential angles that would allow it to fit into the protein pocket.This \"blind docking\" approach creates new opportunities to take advantage of AlphaFold 2 (2020), DeepMind's famous protein folding AI model. Since AlphaFold 1's initial release in 2018, there has been a great deal of excitement in the research community over the potential of AlphaFold's computationally folded protein structures to help identify new drug mechanisms of action.But state-of-the-art molecular docking tools have yet to demonstrate that their performance in binding ligands to computationally predicted structures is any better than random chance.Not only is DiffDock significantly more accurate than previous approaches to traditional docking benchmarks, thanks to its ability to reason at a higher scale and implicitly model some of the protein flexibility, DiffDock maintains high performance, even as other docking models begin to fail.In the more realistic scenario involving the use of computationally generated unbound protein structures, DiffDock places 22 percent of its predictions within 2 angstroms (widely considered to be the threshold for an accurate pose, 1\u00c5 corresponds to one over 10 billion meters), more than double other docking models barely hovering over 10 percent for some and dropping as low as 1.7 percent.These improvements create a new landscape of opportunities for biological research and drug discovery. For instance, many drugs are found via a process known as phenotypic screening, in which researchers observe the effects of a given drug on a disease without knowing which proteins the drug is acting upon.Discovering the mechanism of action of the drug is then critical to understanding how the drug can be improved and its potential side effects. This process, known as \"reverse screening,\" can be extremely challenging and costly, but a combination of protein folding techniques and DiffDock may allow performing a large part of the process in silico, allowing potential \"off-target\" side effects to be identified early on before clinical trials take place.\"DiffDock makes drug target identification much more possible. Before, one had to do laborious and costly experiments (months to years) with each protein to define the drug docking. But now, one can screen many proteins and do the triaging virtually in a day,\" Tim Peterson, an assistant professor at the University of Washington St. Louis School of Medicine, says. Peterson used DiffDock to characterize the mechanism of action of a novel drug candidate treating aging-related diseases in a recent paper.\"There is a very 'fate loves irony' aspect that Eroom's law\u2014that drug discovery takes longer and costs more money each year\u2014is being solved by its namesake Moore's law\u2014that computers get faster and cheaper each year\u2014using tools such as DiffDock.\"The findings are published on the arXiv preprint server.

  "text": "Manganese oxides are natural reactive minerals and widely spread in aquatic and terrestrial environments, affecting the fate of metals (such as As3+ and Cd2+) and organic pollutants (such as phenols and diclofenac) through adsorption and oxidation in sewage treatment. Usually, the manganese (III/IV) oxides in the environment are thought to be formed by the oxidation of dissolved Mn(II) through abiotic or biotic processes.          Oxidation of aqueous Mn(II) by dissolved oxygen is thermodynamically favored, but the kinetic is slow due to the high energy barrier of the reaction from dissolved Mn(II) to Mn(III/IV) oxides. The presence of microorganisms accelerates the oxidation rate, which is 4\u20135 orders of magnitude faster than the rate of abiotic chemical oxidation, therefore is considered as the initial source of manganese oxides in the environment.Bacteria capable of catalyzing the oxidation of dissolved Mn(II) ions to undissolved Mn(III/IV) oxides are usually called manganese-oxidizing bacteria. The bacterial oxidation of Mn(II) ions are divided into direct and indirect ways, and the process catalyzed by enzymes on the surface of microorganisms is called direct oxidation. For indirect pathways, some bacteria can change their surrounding environmental conditions for Mn(II) oxidation (e.g., the pH and Eh).Roseobacter clade has been demonstrated to oxidize Mn(II) by producing extracellular reactive oxygen species in recent studies. Do other bacteria clades have similar Mn(II) oxidation processes with Roseobacter? Is the Mn(II) oxidation closely relative to the physiological process of bacteria?To answer these questions, Prof. Feng Zhao from Chinese Academy of Sciences and his team members explored the microbial manganese oxidation process under visible light by using coastal surface seawater microorganisms. The relationship between the transformation of soluble Mn(II) into insoluble Mn(III/IV) oxides by microorganisms and physiological role was analyzed. This study is published in Frontiers of Environmental Science & Engineering in 2023.In this study, the research team found visible light greatly promotes the oxidation rate of Mn(II), and the average rate reaches 64 \u03bcmol/(L\u00b7d). The generated manganese oxides were then conducive to Mn(II) oxidation, thus the rapid manganese oxidation was the result of the combined action of biotic and abiotic, and biological function accounts for 88 % \u00b1 4 %.Extracellular superoxide produced by microorganisms induced by visible light is the decisive factor for the rapid manganese oxidation in our study. But the production of these superoxides does not require the presence of Mn(II) ions, the Mn(II) oxidation process was more like an unintentional side reaction, which did not affect the growth of microorganisms.More than 70 % of heterotrophic microorganisms in nature are capable of producing superoxide, based on the oxidizing properties of free radicals, all these bacteria can participate in the geochemical cycle of manganese. What's more, the superoxide oxidation pathway might be a significant natural source of manganese oxide.This study revealed an essential pathway for bacterial manganese oxidation. Heterotrophic bacteria produce superoxide under visible light irradiation and oxidize Mn(II) ions in the surrounding environment, which is the main source of manganese oxides. The biogenerated Mn(III/IV) oxides can also oxidize Mn(II) ions indirectly through abiotic reactions under light illumination.Many bacteria in the environment that produce superoxide actively or passively may also oxidize Mn(II) in this way, suggesting that the manganese oxidation pathway through superoxide is a common behavior in the environment. In light of the oxidation properties and semiconductor properties of manganese oxides, this research will provide new ideas for the treatment of environmental pollution.

  "text": "Just as a tight core is a component of good physical fitness for humans, helping to stabilize our bodies, mutations that tightened the core of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in new variants may have increased the virus's fitness.          New research led by Penn State reveals that the stem region of the spike protein became progressively tighter over time, and the team thinks this likely improved the virus's ability to transmit through nasal droplets and infect host cells once in the body. The team said the stem region of the protein that emerged in the most recent omicron variants is as rigid as it can get, which could mean that newer vaccines may be effective for longer than the ones that targeted the original variant.\"We wanted to see how the spike protein morphed structurally as it evolved from the original wild-type strain of the virus, through the alpha, delta and most recently omicron variants,\" said Ganesh Anand, associate professor of chemistry and of biochemistry and molecular biology, Penn State.\"We found that the spike protein was initially more flexible at the stem region, which is where the spike protein is bundled together, but over time, mutations caused the protein to become progressively tighter and more rigid, and we think it's now as rigid as it can get. This is important because it means that vaccines that are developed to target the current variant with these rigid spike proteins are likely to be effective for much longer than previous vaccines against the more flexible wild-type strain.\"To study how the spike protein changed with each of the new variants, the team studied the virus in vitro (in a test tube) using a technique called amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry.Anand explained that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is composed of three chain molecules called monomers that are bound together to form a trimer. The spike protein is made up of two subunits, an S1 and S2 subunit. The S1 subunit contains a receptor binding domain while the S2 subunit contains the stem region responsible for bundling the trimer.\"It is analogous to a tree, with the stem forming the trunk and the receptor binding domain forming the branches,\" said Anand.The team's results, which published in the journal eLife, revealed that the spike protein stem first became more rigid with the D614G mutation, which is common to all SARS-CoV-2 variants. The stem became progressively more twisted with the emergence of new mutations in subsequent variants, and the omicron BA.1 variant showed the largest magnitude increase in stabilization relative to preceding variants.      Why would the virus benefit from a tighter core?\"We did not study the virus in patients, so we cannot determine if the changes we observed in the spike protein directly affected the newer variants such as omicron's ability to transmit more readily; however, we can say that the changes likely made the virus more fit, which could translate to better transmission,\" said Anand.\"A tighter core could likely make the virus more stable in nasal droplets and faster at binding to and entering host cells. So, for example, what initially took about 11 days to develop an infection after exposure now takes only about four days.\"Anand noted that one of the reasons the vaccines have not been able to fully neutralize the virus is because they were generated against the spike protein of the original wild-type variant.\"The latest bivalent booster\u2014which targets newer variants\u2014helps, but people who never got this booster aren't receiving this more targeted protection,\" he said. \"Future vaccines that focus specifically on omicron are likely to be effective for longer.\"Finally, Anand said that the spike protein has now become so tightly twisted that it is unlikely to structurally change further at the stem region.\"There are limits to how much it can tighten,\" he said. \"I think that we can have some cautious optimism, in that we're not going to continuously have variants emerging, at least tightening is not going to be a mechanism.\"Other Penn State authors on the paper include chemistry graduate students Sean Braet, Theresa Buckley and Varun Venkatakrishnan.

  "answer_squad": " higher",
  "text": "In a study, published in the journal Science China Chemistry and led by Prof. Pingping Fang (School of Chemistry, Zhejiang University) and Prof. Jianfeng Li (College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University), experiments were performed by using an Xplora Raman spectrometer with a 50x microscope objective and an excitation wavelength of 638 nm from a He\u2013Ne laser.          \"Due to the proper adsorption energy of CO on the partially oxidized Ag NWs, it is of great significance to correlate the high ethanol selectivity for CO2 electroreduction with the partially oxidized active center. Ag catalysts have been shown to exhibit high selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to CO at low over potentials with depressed H2 evolution. CO is an important intermediate for C-C coupling, therefore, Ag has the potential to exhibit high selectivity for ethanol products by tuning the adsorption energy of CO. This study provides a new insight to design efficient catalysts and investigate the mechanisms to improve the selectivity,\" Fang says.Interestingly, high ethanol FE was obtained on partially oxidized Ag NWs for CO2 electroreduction, and operando EC-SERS combined with DFT calculation explained the mechanisms why partially oxidized Ag NWs exhibited so high ethanol selectivity. The ethanol FE can reach as high as 85% on partially oxidized Ag NWs at \u22120.95 V vs. RHE. Operando EC-SERS found the high coverage of CO can greatly facilitate the ethanol formation on partially oxidized Ag NWs during CO2 electroreduction.DFT calculation results show that the adsorption energy of CO on the partially oxidized Ag NWs is higher than that on Cu, and the reaction free energy of CO coupling with *CHO to *COCHO intermediate on partially oxidized Ag NWs is smaller than that on Cu surface, which explains the high ethanol selectivity very well.Therefore, experiment results, operando EC-SERS and DFT calculations together prove that such partially oxidized Ag NWs can provide high ethanol selectivity for CO2 electroreduction. These results provide new clues for designing Ag based catalysts to improve the ethanol selectivity and mechanism studies.

  "answer_squad": " Convection",
  "text": "A self-propagating chemical reaction can transform a liquid monomer into a solid polymer, and the interaction between the propagating front and the reaction's natural convection leads to patterns in the resulting solid polymeric material. New University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign work has shown how the coupling between natural convection and frontal polymerization leads to those observed patterns.          This research was led by a unique team of researchers: Materials Science and Engineering professor Nancy Sottos, Aerospace Engineering professor Philippe Geubelle, and Mechanical Science and Engineering professor Leonardo Chamorro. A paper describing this research was recently published in Physical Review Letters.Thermoset polymers and composite materials are used in a wide range of industries, but producing such materials requires their being cured at high temperatures in a slow and highly energy intensive process. Frontal polymerization to cure the materials is an attractive alternative approach that is significantly faster and more energy efficient.In frontal polymerization, a self-propagating chemical front converts a liquid monomer into a solid polymer through a reaction that generates a significant amount of heat. Monomers are a simple class of molecular \"building blocks\" that can react to form larger molecules that are polymers. All of the energy needed to create the polymer is contained within the monomer itself, and to harness that energy, only a small stimulus is needed to kick off the reaction.Because of instabilities, that self-propagating front doesn't always move uniformly. Although it is ideal for the front to move smoothly and at a constant speed for applications like composite manufacturing and 3D printing, Geubelle says, \"We're actually very interested in these instabilities because they allow us to generate patterns in the material. That's very exciting, because for some materials, these instabilities can lead to very different properties for the material.\"Geubelle explains that the team's goal was \"to understand, experimentally and computationally, the interaction between the front that is propagating in the monomer bath and the convection that takes place ahead of it, and how the interaction between the two can lead to patterns in the material.\"To visualize and characterize the polymerization front and the recirculation ahead of the front, the team had to design a clever mold that would allow them to make observations through both the top and the side. They constructed and used a glass mold that allowed for the observation of the front from the top and for a laser beam to enter from the side.      They then used particle image velocimetry (PIV) to characterize the velocity field. To use PIV, they needed to seed the fluid with small \"tracer\" particles that would follow the flow and would be tracked by a camera and illuminated by a laser sheet to visualize the patterns in the material. Chamorro says that particle selection was one of the challenges of this work. The team tried various kinds of particles before settling on silver-coated glass particles.They were able to show that as the front propagates and transforms the liquid monomer into the solid polymer, the energy released generates convection. Convection is a process where heat is transferred by the movement of a heated fluid. Like water in the ocean, when a fluid is heated, it expands, and due to buoyancy, the hotter fluid rises because it is less dense, and colder fluid replaces it by sinking to the bottom because it is more dense. This process continues, creating a recirculating flow.The polymerization process gives off a lot of heat, resulting in temperatures over 350\u00b0 F. That heat generated during the transformation goes to the top of the surface. The researchers showed that this was a buoyancy-driven process, and that the recirculation associated with the heat of the reaction, along with the effect of gravity, leads to the formation of the patterning observed in the material and to the impact on the polymerization front. Thanks to the recirculation, the front tends to be inclined rather than perfectly vertical. That inclined front can result in a different speed or cooling effect and even a different patterning effect.Sottos says the experiments revealed that the recirculation not only creates patterns inside the material that affects the material's properties, but \"it also creates surface patterns on the top of the material as well, because the monomer is getting pushed by the recirculating flow.\"The revealed mechanisms of the interaction between the polymerization front and the induced natural convection, and the resulting patterning, represent a deepened understanding of frontal polymerization that may be helpful in the future manufacture of polymeric materials.Other authors on this work include Yuan Gao (postdoc, Beckman Institute and Aerospace Engineering); Justine Paul (graduate student, Beckman Institute and Material Science and Engineering); Manxin Chen (undergraduate student, Beckman Institute and Aerospace Engineering); and Liu Hong (graduate student, Mechanical Science and Engineering).

  "text": "Toxic heavy metals found in wastewater have health and safety ramifications for communities affected by pollution. Hexavalent chromium is a dangerous, cancer-causing byproduct of industrial processes that is known to cause birth defects, severe diarrhea, and is linked to kidney, bladder, and liver cancers. Famously, it was the center of the lawsuit dramatized in the film \"Erin Brockovich.\"          Researchers are trying to find effective ways to remove hexavalent chromium from wastewater and a recently published paper shows how photocatalytic technology may be a solution. Photocatalysis is when light and a catalyst are used to speed up chemical reactions.The paper was published in Polyoxometalates.\"Rapid industrialization causes an increased release of wastewater containing heavy metal ions. Hexavalent chromium, which has high carcinogenicity and teratogenicity, is widely found in wastewater and can easily enter food chains,\" said Yuan-Yuan Ma, a researcher at Hebei Normal University in Shijiazhuang, China. Photocatalysis technology is an appealing solution for removing heavy metals from wastewater because it is sustainable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.\"This green approach for the removal of heavy metal ions uses sustainable light energy via hourglass-type phosphomolybdate-based crystalline photocatalysts and develops a strategy for the regulation of photocatalytic performance by adjusting the central metal ions in hourglass-type phosphomolybdate clusters,\" said Ma. Researchers chose this particular type of photocatalyst because of its molecular properties and well-defined hourglass-type structure, which give it a wide light absorption ability and the band structure necessary to reduce the levels of hexavalent chromium.Researchers tested four \"hybrid\" photocatalysts and compared them to six other photocatalysts. The hybrids had slightly different compositions, but all had the same hourglass-type structure that could be maintained up to 200 degrees Celsius. They had wide visible-light absorption and similar energy band structures. Researchers labeled these as Hybrid 1, 2, 3, and 4. After 80 minutes of exposure to a 10W LED light, hybrid 1 and 3 had around a 90% reduction in hexavalent chromium, while 2 and 4 had around a 74% and 71% reduction in hexavalent chromium respectively.The hybrids generally performed better than any of the tested photocatalysts. Hybrids 1 and 3, which performed best, both were Mn{P4MO6}2-based hybrids. Hybrids 2 and 4 were Co{P4MO6}2-based. Researchers suspect that the better performance was due to structural differences that gave hybrids 1 and 3 a narrower band gap. \"The semiconductor photocatalysts in photocatalytic processes can absorb photons matched with their band gap energy, leading to the conversion of toxic hexavalent chromium to less toxic chromium,\" said Ma.Looking ahead, researchers will focus on improving the design of the photocatalysts, while also planning for how to best bring this technology to a real-world wastewater setting. \"Designing effective photocatalysts is the first step to solve heavy metal pollution in water,\" said Ma. \"We will design more efficient photocatalysts and apply the developed photocatalysts to actual industrial wastewater. We will also expand the treatment range of polluted water sources and strive to realize the practicality of the photocatalyst materials used.\" More information:Xiao-Yu Yin et al, Photoactive hourglass-type M{P 4Mo 6} 2 networks for efficient removal of hexavalent chromium, Polyoxometalates (2023).

To this end, they have recently developed new catalysts based on other transition metals, such as ruthenium, cobalt, and nickel, which exhibit much higher catalytic activity than iron.However, these catalysts preferentially adsorb hydrogen atoms onto their surface at low temperatures of 100\u2013150oC, which reduces nitrogen adsorption and thus hampers ammonia production. This phenomenon, known as hydrogen poisoning, poses an obstacle to the low-temperature HB process.In this light, researchers led by Professor Michikazu Hara of the Laboratory for Materials and Structures at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), have refocused on iron-based catalysts and modified them to produce ammonia at 100oC. Their work is all set to be published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.Prof. Hara explains the motivation behind the research. \"Hydrogen poisoning is not strong for iron-based catalysts. Therefore, they may be used for the low-temperature HB process but only when combined with an appropriate promoter that increases their catalytic activity.\" In this work, the researchers prepared metallic iron (Fe) nanoparticles on calcium hydride (CaH2) particles, with a mixture of barium oxide (BaO) and barium hydride (BaH2) deposited on them.A set of experiments revealed that the iron nanoparticles interact strongly with the hydride ions of both hydrides. As a result, hydrogen atoms move from the hydrides to the nanoparticles and get desorbed as hydrogen gas, leaving behind electrons. The hydrides donate these electrons to the iron nanoparticles. It facilitates the breaking of nitrogen gas into atoms, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity for ammonia production even at low temperatures.The BaH2\u2013BaO/Fe/CaH2 catalyst exhibited a turnover frequency of 0.23 s-1 at 100oC and 12.3 s-1 at 300oC under a moderate pressure of 0.9 MPa. These values, orders of magnitude higher than those for catalysts based on other transition metals, result from the ability of iron to prevent hydrogen poisoning by desorbing the adsorbed hydrogen atoms as hydrogen gas at low temperatures.Discussing the future potential of their work, Prof. Hara observes, \"The BaH2\u2013BaO/Fe/CaH2 catalyst facilitates low-temperature HB process, which consumes less energy. As such, it can reduce the use of fossil fuels and potentially lower global carbon emissions. In addition, iron is abundant and inexpensive, which makes the HB process more sustainable.\" More information:Michikazu Hara et al, Low temperature ammonia synthesis on iron catalyst with an electron donor, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2023).

  "text": "Hydrogen production powered by wind and solar energy is still too expensive if it is to play a role in the clean transition via energy storage and to help decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors. Much effort in reducing its cost focuses on enhancing production efficiency by improving the performance of iridium-based catalysts that can speed up the oxygen-related part of the electrochemical reaction involved in splitting water into its component parts, hydrogen and oxygen.          A new review of the state of the field discusses its recent progress and challenges and identifies research gaps that need to be filled before such catalysts can achieve commercial viability.The review paper was published in the journal Nano Research Energy.Cleanly produced hydrogen is essential in the transition away from fossil fuels in order to avoid dangerous climate change, both as an energy carrier to be used on its own or as a component of a synthetic fuel for those sections of the economy such as long-haul shipping and aviation that are hard to electrify.But such clean hydrogen production\u2014which is performed via electrolysis, using electricity to split water into its component elements, hydrogen and oxygen\u2014is extremely energy intensive. This energy intensity of electrolysis in turn makes clean production of hydrogen very expensive, and thus uncompetitive with fossil fuels.If this were not enough of a challenge, using wind and solar energy as the source of clean electricity to power the electrolysis\u2014a form of hydrogen production termed 'green hydrogen'\u2014places a significant burden on the electrolyzers because these energy sources are intermittent. The sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow.This means that sometimes there is little to no current and at other times, there can be a big spike of current, which places stress on the electrolyzers, again pushing up costs. However, proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) are a very promising option here, as PEMWEs can operate at high current densities such as those posed by these spikes.Electrolysis is a chemical reaction composed of two parts, or 'half reactions.' One is the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which generates the hydrogen, and the other is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which produces the oxygen. But it is actually the latter reaction that is most important with respect to the energy efficiency of the overall process and thus production of clean hydrogen.      And so to reduce the energy demands and thus the cost of clean production of hydrogen, a lot of research has focused on superior catalysts\u2014chemicals that speed up a chemical reaction\u2014for the OER part of the process and that pair well with PEMWEs.However, the severe corrosion in the acidic environment of PEMWEs makes most non-precious metal-based catalysts\u2014for example using cobalt, nickel, or iron\u2014unstable. But iridium-based catalysts exhibit much better catalytic stability in these harsh acidic conditions.A number of recent studies have reported significant advances in the development of iridium-based catalysts for green hydrogen production, including the use of new synthesis methods and the optimization of catalyst structures and compositions.However, there are still several research challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of iridium-based catalysts for green hydrogen production. One major challenge is the high cost of iridium\u2014and high costs are precisely what novel catalysts were intended to avoid.\"To overcome this, researchers are exploring new synthesis methods and alternative catalyst materials that can replace iridium or reduce the amount of iridium required,\" said Chunyun Wang, of the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Yangzhou University and lead author of the review. \"Some novel and effective options have emerged recently, such as iridium oxides, perovskites, pyrochlores, and single-atom catalysts.\"\"And so we thought it was about time that we paused and assessed the state of play in iridium-based catalysts for green hydrogen production with a review paper,\" added Alex Schechter, a chemist with Ariel University in Israel and co-author of the review paper. \"The benefit of this is to pool information across many different teams of researchers and, crucially, identify research gaps.\"The review focuses in particular on how the catalysis operates (the catalytic mechanism), design of catalysts, and strategies for synthesis of catalysts. In particular, the analysis looks at different attributes of catalysts that affect their promotion of the catalysis process including geometric effects, electronic effects, synergistic effects, defect engineering and support effects, and how different research teams have dealt with each option to try to improve performance.Geometric effects in essence describe the shape, structure and size of the catalyst molecule, including which of its crystal planes are exposed, and how atomic arrangements might be ordered or disordered. All of this significantly affects catalyst performance. Electronic effects refer to the structure of electrons associated with the relevant molecules.Synergistic effects are those where two or more ingredients come together to produce a superior result than either one on its own. Defect engineering involves efforts to design the surface chemistry of catalysts via voids, dislocations, vacancies and so on\u2014deliberately introducing imperfections\u2014so as to increase the number of places where the chemical reaction can take place (active sites). And support effects come from metals that interact with and support the catalyst.The reviewers concluded after surveying their field that the most successful strategy for improving the performance of iridium-based catalysts includes defect engineering, adjusting synergistic effects and altering geometric effects. The number of exposed active sites can be increased by constructing a porous structure and introducing supports for the catalyst that promote transfer of both mass and electrons. And enhanced metal-support interaction can increase the long-term stability of the catalysts.Despite the considerable research success, the field still faces challenges. Many high-performance iridium-based catalysts have been developed, but most of them can only be synthesized on a small scale of just a few grams or even hundreds of milligrams in the laboratory. Complex preparation processes thus must be simplified.In addition, lab conditions are a bit too ideal compared to actual catalytic systems, and so real-world conditions need to be part of any follow-up research. This includes looking at realistic electrolyzer temperature, current density, and product delivery, amongst other aspects, that will enable evaluation of performance catalysts in practical applications.And beyond the catalysts themselves, other components need to be optimized as well, including the development of electrode plates with high corrosion resistance and low cost, proton exchange membranes with high proton transport capacity.The reviewers stressed however that none of these challenges are deal-breakers for iridium-based catalysts for green hydrogen production. Instead these represent possible avenues for new research that may deliver the breakthroughs this process requires to achieve commercial viability.

  "text": "A common amino acid, glycine, can deliver a \"slow-down\" signal to the brain, likely contributing to major depression, anxiety and other mood disorders in some people, scientists at the Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology have found.          The discovery, outlined Thursday in the journal Science, improves understanding of the biological causes of major depression and could accelerate efforts to develop new, faster-acting medications for such hard-to-treat mood disorders, said neuroscientist Kirill Martemyanov, Ph.D., corresponding author of the study.\"Most medications for people with depression take weeks before they kick in, if they do at all. New and better options are really needed,\" said Martemyanov, who chairs the neuroscience department at the institute in Jupiter.Major depression is among the world's most urgent health needs. Its numbers have surged in recent years, especially among young adults. As depression's disability, suicide numbers and medical expenses have climbed, a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2021 put its economic burden at $326 billion annually in the United States.Martemyanov said he and his team of students and postdoctoral researchers have spent many years working toward this discovery. They didn't set out to find a cause, much less a possible treatment route for depression. Instead, they asked a basic question: How do sensors on brain cells receive and transmit signals into the cells? Therein lay the key to understanding vision, pain, memory, behavior and possibly much more, Martemyanov suspected.\"It's amazing how basic science goes. Fifteen years ago we discovered a binding partner for proteins we were interested in, which led us to this new receptor,\" Martemyanov said. \"We've been unspooling this for all this time.\"In 2018 the Martemyanov team found the new receptor was involved in stress-induced depression. If mice lacked the gene for the receptor, called GPR158, they proved surprisingly resilient to chronic stress.      That offered strong evidence that GPR158 could be therapeutic target, he said. But what sent the signal?A breakthrough came in 2021, when his team solved the structure of GPR158. What they saw surprised them. The GPR158 receptor looked like a microscopic clamp with a compartment\u2014akin to something they had seen in bacteria, not human cells.\"We were barking up the completely wrong tree before we saw the structure,\" Martemyanov said. \"We said, 'Wow, that's an amino acid receptor. There are only 20, so we screened them right away and only one fit perfectly. That was it. It was glycine.\"That wasn't the only odd thing. The signaling molecule was not an activator in the cells, but an inhibitor. The business end of GPR158 connected to a partnering molecule that hit the brakes rather than the accelerator when bound to glycine.\"Usually receptors like GPR158, known as G protein Coupled Receptors, bind G proteins. This receptor was binding an RGS protein, which is a protein that has the opposite effect of activation,\" said Thibaut Laboute, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher from Martemyanov's group and first author of the study.Scientists have been cataloging the role of cell receptors and their signaling partners for decades. Those that still don't have known signalers, such as GPR158, have been dubbed \"orphan receptors.\"The finding means that GPR158 is no longer an orphan receptor, Laboute said. Instead, the team renamed it mGlyR, short for \"metabotropic glycine receptor.\"\"An orphan receptor is a challenge. You want to figure out how it works,\" Laboute said. \"What makes me really excited about this discovery is that it may be important for people's lives. That's what gets me up in the morning.\"Laboute and Martemyanov are listed as inventors on a patent application describing methods to study GPR158 activity. Martemyanov is a cofounder of Blueshield Therapeutics, a startup company pursuing GPR158 as a drug target.Glycine itself is sold as a nutritional supplement billed as improving mood. It is a basic building block of proteins and affects many different cell types, sometimes in complex ways. In some cells, it sends slow-down signals, while in other cell types, it sends excitatory signals. Some studies have linked glycine to the growth of invasive prostate cancer.More research is needed to understand how the body maintains the right balance of mGlyR receptors and how brain cell activity is affected, he said. He intends to keep at it.\"We are in desperate need of new depression treatments,\" Martemyanov said. \"If we can target this with something specific, it makes sense that it could help. We are working on it now.\" More information:Thibaut Laboute et al, Orphan receptor GPR158 serves as a metabotropic glycine receptor: mGlyR, Science (2023).

  "text": "Researchers at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP) in Brazil have developed a kraft paper-based electrochemical sensor that can detect traces of pesticides in fruit and vegetables in real time when coupled to an electronic device. In an apple or cabbage, for example, it can detect carbendazim, a fungicide widely used in Brazil despite being banned.          The results are reported in an article published in the journal Food Chemistry.\"To find out whether a food sample contains traces of pesticides by conventional methods, you must grind up the sample and submit it to time-consuming chemical processes before any such substances can be detected. Wearable sensors like the one we developed for continuous monitoring of pesticides in agriculture and the food industry eliminate the need for these complex processes. Inspection is much easier, cheaper and reliable for a supermarket, restaurant or importer, for example,\" said Osvaldo Novais de Oliveira Junior, penultimate author of the article and a professor at IFSC-USP.The new device is highly sensitive and resembles the glucometers used by diabetics to measure blood sugar, except that the results of food scanning for pesticides are displayed on a smartphone. \"In the tests we performed, its sensitivity was similar to the conventional method's. Plus, it's fast and inexpensive,\" said Jos\u00e9 Luiz Bott Neto, corresponding author of the article and a postdoctoral fellow at IFSC-USP.How it worksThe device consists basically of a paper substrate modified with carbon ink and submitted to electrochemical treatment in an acid medium to activate carboxyl groups and make detection possible, Bott Neto explained.\"We use the silkscreen process to transfer carbon-conducting ink to a strip of kraft paper, thereby creating a device based on electrochemistry. It has three carbon electrodes and is immersed in an acidic solution to activate the carboxyl groups. In other words, oxygen atoms are added to the structure of the carbon electrode. When it comes into contact with a sample contaminated with carbendazim, the sensor induces an electrochemical oxidation reaction that permits detection of the fungicide. The quantity of carbendazim is measured via electrical current,\" he said.In developing the device, the researchers evaluated the stability and structure of the paper substrate. \"The properties of the paper itself were an important part of our research,\" said Thiago Serafim Martins, first author of the article and a postdoctoral fellow at IFSC-USP.Best optionThe researchers analyzed kraft paper and parchment, finding both types of paper to be stable enough to serve as a substrate for the sensor. However, the porousness of kraft paper conferred more sensitivity on the sensor and the carboxyl groups formed during electrochemical activation, Martins explained, adding that paper-based electrodes could be used in many applications.\"There are commercial electrodes made of plastic or ceramic material. We successfully developed electrochemical sensors based on paper, a much more malleable material and therefore potentially useful in many areas, not just on farms or in supermarkets, but also in healthcare, for example,\" he said.

  "text": "Photocatalysis is the use of light to accelerate the rate of a reaction in the presence of a photocatalyst. The catalyst plays a crucial role in this process\u2014it absorbs the light being shined onto it and makes it available in ways that can help accelerate the chemical reaction and also enhance it. These catalysts are used for a variety of light-dependent reactions ranging from the production of paper to the conversion of carbon dioxide to fuel.          Given these applications, the development of ideal photocatalysts is important. An ideal photocatalyst is one that uses a single transition metal that performs both visible light absorption and chemical transformation. Currently, visible light-driven single transition metal catalysts are limited to only one mechanism of operation, known as the radical mechanism, or have a low light-harvesting ability, making them heavily dependent on certain substrates. Thus, there is a need for an ideal single transition metal catalyst that solves these problems.A team of researchers from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), led by Assistant Professor Yuki Nagashima, have reported a novel visible light-driven single transition metal catalyst that solves these issues. Their findings are published in Nature Synthesis. Dr. Nagashima explains, \"We envisioned unprecedented rhodium (Rh)-based photocatalysts\u2014spiro-fluorene-indenoindenyl (SFI)-Rh(I) complexes\u2014that combine high light harvesting abilities with broad applicability.\"The team found that extending the molecules around the central Rh atom\u2014called the ligand\u2014is necessary to increase the light harvesting abilities of these complexes, but also makes them less stable. Thus, the team designed SFI-Rh(I) complexes using a non-fused extension strategy, extending the molecules around the ligand without compromising the stability of the resultant catalyst.In fact, their extension strategy made the catalyst stable against protonation and helped in increasing its light-harvesting ability, thus reducing its substrate dependence. The catalyst was also designed to be able to perform using multiple mechanisms, beyond the radical mechanism used by previous catalysts.\"The careful design of our catalyst enabled it to have many advantages compared to previously described catalysts, while making it suitable for complex reactions. The SFI-Rh(I) complexes can easily extend the scope of typical Rh-catalyzed reactions using blue light LED irradiation at room temperature. This opens many avenues for future applications of these catalysts, as well as photocatalytic reactions in general,\" says Nagashima.\"We believe that this catalyst has the potential to be a versatile light-driven catalyst that can break through the ground-state limitations in various photoreactions.\" More information:Yuki Nagashima, Design, synthesis and visible-light-induced non-radical reactions of dual-functional Rh catalysts, Nature Synthesis (2023).

The results were obtained using low-concentration CO2, equivalent to exhaust gas, and powered by light equivalent to sunlight for 24 hours.          The researchers expect that this innovative way of producing biodegradable plastic could not only reduce CO2 emissions but also provide a way of reusing laboratory and industrial waste acetone. Their findings have been published in the journal Green Chemistry.Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate\u2014a biodegradable plastic\u2014is a strong water-resistant polyester often used in packaging materials, made from 3-hydroxybutyrate as a precursor. In previous studies, a research team led by Professor Yutaka Amao from the Research Center for Artificial Photosynthesis at Osaka Metropolitan University found that 3-hydroxybutyrate can be synthesized from CO2 and acetone with high efficiency, but this was only demonstrated at higher concentrations of CO2 or sodium bicarbonate.This new study aimed to reuse waste acetone from permanent marker ink and low concentrations of CO2\u2014equivalent to exhaust gas from power plants, chemical plants, or steel factories. Acetone is a relatively inexpensive and reasonably harmless chemical used in many different laboratory settings, either for reactions or as a cleaning agent, which produces waste acetone.

  "text": "A breakthrough in synthesis strategy enables the facile formulation of inorganic membranes that are not just energy-efficient but also highly customizable, potentially revolutionizing the way many industries operate for greater sustainability.          Inorganic membranes can be thought of as kitchen sieves. Similar to how sieves separate smaller particles from larger ones, inorganic membranes, typically made of ceramics or metals, selectively separate molecules based on their size and properties.In a ground-breaking achievement, a team of researchers from the College of Design and Engineering (CDE) at the National University of Singapore, led by Professor Ho Ghim Wei from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, has developed a revolutionary technique for producing ultrathin inorganic membranes. These freestanding membranes can function without any supporting substrate\u2014a significant advancement in membrane technology. The team's findings were published in the scientific journal Nature on March 29, 2023.Highly customizable and simple to produce, the inorganic membranes\u2014underpinned by a universal, facile synthesis strategy\u2014have the potential to benefit applications beyond filtration and separation. From energy conversion to catalysis and sensing, the membranes' versatility could transform various sectors and industries that depend on membrane technology. By promoting efficiency and sustainability in industrial processes, the NUS scientists' pioneering research has unveiled new possibilities for overcoming energy challenges in the face of climate change.Membranes reimaginedConventional membrane technologies used in purification and separation processes are known to be energy-intensive and therefore expensive, often entailing a combination of pressure, heat, and sometimes chemicals to function effectively. Moreover, the membranes must be regenerated, while the filtered components usually require further treatment after separation, leading to additional energy demands and costs.Such limitations of traditional membrane technologies served as the impetus for postdoctoral research fellow Dr. Zhang Chen in Prof Ho's team to develop a new synthesis strategy for highly efficient inorganic membranes. Dr. Zhang's method involves taming chaotic, free-floating, inorganic building-blocks in a liquid environment, coaxing them to self-assemble into the desired membrane. This tunable process provides an effective means to tailor the membrane's thickness and pore characteristics for specific applications, achieving maximum energy efficiency.\"Our study has also allowed us to take a fresh approach to rethink how inorganic membranes are traditionally developed,\" added Dr. Zhang.The NUS scientists have presented a synthesis template that other researchers can utilize for their work, which could spur the discovery of more novel membranes with a wider compositional range in a scalable and cost-effective manner.From a structural perspective, the membranes they produced have more geometric diversity than conventional ones, providing more flexibility and options when designing membrane structures.Additionally, the study also explores membrane functionality, where highly selective 2D barriers are used to control energy flow across the membrane. This feature could influence how the membrane functions\u2014allowing ions to be filtered based on their charge, different forms of energy such as thermal, electrical, or light to be harnessed, or specific molecules to be selectively concentrated. Such flexibility is highly desirable in various energy-related applications, including fuel cells and solar energy conversion.\"Our new technique has the potential to transform industries that heavily rely on membranes for their operation, particularly those related to energy or the environment,\" said Prof Ho. \"The ability to create freestanding inorganic membranes that are highly selective opens up numerous exciting possibilities for applications in advanced spatial dynamic separation, catalysis, sensors, memories, and ionic conductors, all of which represent unprecedented developments.\"      Formulating a greener future With an emphasis on efficiency and customization, the researchers' innovation plays a key role in NUS' sustainability initiatives, greatly reducing the energy consumption of membrane-related processes worldwide and cutting the carbon footprint of various industries as a result.Driven by the potential of the breakthrough, Prof Ho plans to lead an interdisciplinary team of scientists in a multi-faceted research program to advance membrane technology to the next level. \"By exploring the vast range of membrane compositions and coupling them with various forms of energy, we hope to unlock new applications and make further strides towards a more sustainable future,\" shared Prof Ho.The team is also looking to develop automated manufacturing tools to streamline the production process of inorganic membranes, ultimately making their technology more accessible on a larger scale.

  "text": "Microbes may be among the smallest living things on Earth, but bioimaging to understand the chemistry that fuels these organisms could reveal important clues about the intricacies of gene function and the health of the planet. Because of this, scientists have long sought ways to eavesdrop on conversations between living microbes in their environment.          This has been exceptionally difficult, in part because microbes communicate using molecules instead of words. Deciphering conversations means identifying small, specific, and quickly changing molecules called metabolites, something even the most powerful instruments struggle to attempt. But a team of researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have spent the last decade continuously developing a next-generation bioimaging instrument that is making progress toward this goal.The Chemical Dynamics Initiative (CDi), an internal PNNL investment, supported PNNL chemist Patrick El Khoury and his team as they developed the technology to measure phenomena in the quantum realm. Here the team imaged subatomic waves of energy called phonons as they formed, beat, and dissipated in a single trillionth of a second.\"Similar technologies can be used to image phonons and metabolites in real space and real time,\" said El Khoury. \"The fundamental advances required in both areas comprise a challenge worthy of a national laboratory and continued investments.\"Now researchers are taking the technologies to the next level as they use bioimaging to map metabolites exchanged by live microbes.Bioimaging to fish out whispers in a crowdThe bioimager is known as BIGTUNA, short for BioImaginG Technology Using Nano-optical Approach. The keys to BIGTUNA are its multiple optical capabilities, each providing complementary information about the position and composition of molecules in a study sample. Many laser sources focus on the tip of a very sharp nanosized needle. Researchers position the needle's tip in the sample area they want to examine, then use the light focused on the tip of the needle to measure the sample's physical and chemical features. Through this, researchers identify molecules and understand how they interact.                One of the custom-built nano-optical system precursors to the BIGTUNA bioimaging device. Credit: Patrick El-Khoury, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory             Chemical bioimaging with light has been done for a hundred years, but never at this molecular scale.\"Some methods illuminate a relatively large area, but these far-field approaches are like listening in to a crowd and expecting to understand individual conversations,\" said PNNL chemist Scott Lea. To overcome this challenge, researchers focused on combining a wide range of near-field techniques to capture and characterize the maximum information in an area as small as a few molecules.\"If we don't have multiple streams of data coming from multiple techniques, we only get partial information,\" said El Khoury. \"And in addition to developing the techniques, we developed our understanding of optical selection rules to maximize the information we get from one sample in one set-up.\"In the most recent iteration of this project, the researchers zoomed out to a larger area, although still only a thousandth the thickness of a strand of hair. At this slightly farther distance, they identified the most promising approaches to capture information about the patterns of molecular bonds and the distribution of electrons. These new nano-optical measurements are addressing a much smaller number of molecules; therefore, the researchers must continue developing new theories that describe nanoscopic interactions of light and matter.Combining these conceptual and technological developments will allow the researchers to move beyond model systems they studied using early incarnations of BIGTUNA. The chemical signals in these model systems were much stronger than chemical signals from the metabolites involved in microbial communications. In addition to having weaker signals, biological samples are also susceptible to damage by light, which is why BIGTUNA's noninvasive approach makes it ideal to develop for bioimaging applications. Including state-of-the art data and computational techniques from PNNL data scientists Sarah Akers and Edo Apr\u00e0 will help automate where and how the instrument balances exploration with the sensitivity of a living system.      Bioimaging to tune in to talking microbesAs an initial foray into biology, researchers are focusing BIGTUNA's bioimaging power on a community of symbiotic microbes that live in deep ocean sediments. One microbe reduces sulfur, the other oxidizes methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.                Image of the microbe community (purple and green) within sediment particles (yellow) that researchers are studying through bioimaging with BIGTUNA. Credit: Patrick El Khoury, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory             Previous approaches to unraveling microbial interactions have mainly focused on identifying influential genes or on examining isolated enzymes and pathways. The approaches often include fixing, freezing, or combining the biological system. But these approaches lose out on time-dependent or space-specific details. And the researchers can't look at the flow of metabolites to get a predictive understanding of how and why microbes interact.Even so, PNNL collaborator and CalTech geologist Victoria Orphan has theories about how these symbiotic microbes share metabolites. Bioimaging with BIGTUNA could produce the first close-up view of the metabolites in action as the instrument sends light through the sample and measures what gets absorbed or scattered. Researchers use the information to identify metabolites and create a detailed record of microbial intercellular communication pathways. In turn, this knowledge could help researchers understand the degree to which microbes respond to environmental changes.A new generation of nano-optics\"Possibilities for BIGTUNA extend far beyond the realm of bioimaging,\" said Peter Sushko, CDi's chief scientist. \"Because this highly adaptable instrument can obtain detailed information describing atomic motion and electronic processes, it will be useful in seeking answers to a broad range of questions that are of interest to chemists, physicists, and materials scientists as well.\"Potential applications include quantum materials, catalysis, and human health, in addition to the current work in microbial systems. In that realm, planned future developments could incorporate environmental controls to further generalize the approach.A portion of the blueprint for BIGTUNA was designed under PNNL's CDi, a five-year internal investment in capabilities to better understand and predict the evolution of complex chemical systems in real-world or operational environments.

  "text": "Particles in the atmosphere affect global climate. For example, the black carbon from burning fossil fuels absorbs and radiates light and heat. To calculate the effects of aerosols on climate, scientists rely on simulated aerosol fields. How these models represent aerosol mixing state potentially introduces large uncertainties into climate calculations. This is because the simulated aerosol optical properties\u2014how particles absorb and scatter light\u2014are sensitive to mixing state. Mixing state refers to how various properties are distributed across the particles in the air.          In a new study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, researchers have systematically quantified the effect of aerosol mixing state on aerosol optical properties. To do so, they used an ensemble of 1,800 aerosol populations from different particle-resolved simulations. These complex simulations operate on the scale of single particles.Investigating the impacts of aerosol mixing state on aerosol optical properties is important for both modeling and experimental studies. This new paper approaches this topic by using particle-resolved simulations as a benchmark. It applies this benchmark to determine the error in optical properties when using simplified aerosol representations. These simplified representations are common in state-of-the-art aerosol models. The researchers disentangled the causes for biases in the prediction of optical properties that are introduced by assuming that particles mix within prescribed size bins. Some of these errors are large enough to warrant caution when calculating how particles directly affect climate.Within the study, a research team systematically quantified the errors introduced by internal mixture assumptions used in sectional aerosol models. The internal mixture assumption generally led to an overestimation of the volume absorption coefficients and an underestimation of the volume scattering coefficients. The relative errors for \u03f5(\u03b2abs) and \u03f5(\u03b2scat) reached as high as 70% and \u221232%, respectively. The absorption overestimation and scattering underestimation resulted in a consistent underestimation of single scattering albedo, with errors as great as \u221222.3% and median errors of \u22120.9%. The relative error in the volume absorption coefficient \u03f5(\u03b2abs) displayed a similar pattern for relative humidity of 50% and 90% compared to the dry environment. The relative error in the volume scattering coefficient \u03f5(\u03b2scat) decreased at higher relative humidity because of the enhanced scattering cross-section through hygroscopic growth.The team included researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the Japan Meteorological Agency, the Japanese National Institute of Polar Research, the Japanese Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

  "text": "An ancient biological enzyme known as nickel-iron hydrogenase may play a key role in producing hydrogen for a renewables-based energy economy, researchers have found. Careful study of the enzyme has led chemists from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to design a synthetic molecule that mimics the hydrogen gas-producing chemical reaction performed by the enzyme.          The researchers reported their findings in the journal Nature Communications.Currently, industrial hydrogen is usually produced by separating hydrogen gas molecules from oxygen atoms in water using a process called electrolysis. To boost this chemical reaction in the industrial setting, platinum metal is used as a catalyst in the cathodes that direct the reaction. However, many studies have shown that the expense and rarity of platinum make it unattractive as the world pushes toward more environmentally sound energy sources.On the other hand, nature's nickel-iron hydrogenase enzyme produces hydrogen using earth-abundant metals in its core, said chemistry professor Liviu Mirica, who led the study with graduate student Sagnik Chakrabarti.\"The nickel at the core of the natural enzyme produces hydrogen by reducing protons in water,\" Chakrabarti said. \"During the catalytic process, the nickel center goes through paramagnetic intermediates, meaning that the intermediates have an unpaired electron\u2014which makes them extremely short-lived.\"Synthetic chemists have made nickel compounds that produce hydrogen for over a decade, Mirica said. While some of these compounds are very efficient at producing hydrogen, the vast majority of them operate via intermediates that are not paramagnetic.\"Researchers are trying to mimic exactly what nature does because it is efficient, and maximizing efficiency is a key challenge to overcome when engineering energy sources,\" Mirica said. \"Being able to reproduce the paramagnetic intermediate steps that occur in the natural enzyme is what our group is trying to achieve\u2014to increase efficiency and mimic nature.\"To achieve this, the team designed an organic molecule called a ligand that contains electron-donating atoms like nitrogen and sulfur, and can hold the nickel in place and support the two relevant paramagnetic states that produce hydrogen. The key design element that sets this molecule apart from other catalysts is the presence of a carbon-hydrogen bond near the nickel center that is broken and formed again during catalysis. This was crucial in stabilizing the aforementioned paramagnetic states.\"One of the key takeaways from our work is that by using the specially designed ligand in the manner we did, we have successfully united ideas from two fields of inorganic chemistry\u2014bioinorganic and organometallic chemistry\u2014to make nickel complexes that behave similarly to the active site of one of nature's most beautiful and complicated enzymes,\" Chakrabarti said.In the recent past, several unusual enzymes have been found that feature metal-carbon bonds in their active sites, the researchers said. Such design principles in synthetic complexes could lead to further insights into how nature performs chemistry with small molecules like hydrogen.Former Illinois researchers Soumalya Sinha, Giang N. Tran and Hanah Na contributed to this study.

  "answer_squad": " synthesized N and P co-doping carbon-coated cobalt-based catalysts",
  "text": "Recently, the team from Institute of Solid State Physics, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a breakthrough in the research of non-metallic heteroatom doping to regulate catalytic performance. The researchers synthesized N and P co-doping carbon-coated cobalt-based catalysts (Co@NPC) and explored the effect of heteroatom doping in the catalyst on the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. The study was published in the Journal of Catalysis.          As a potential material in the field of catalysis, heterogeneous catalyst of metal nanoparticles supported on non-metallic atoms doped carbon supports demonstrate great catalytic activity in the catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Compared with metal atoms, non-metal atoms possess greater electronegativity. Therefore, the introduction of non-metal heteroatoms can effectively modulate the electronic structure and chemical properties of the materials and produce rich active sites to improve catalytic performance.In this study, researchers prepared Co@NPC and applied it in the aqueous hydrogenation reaction of cinnamaldehyde. The catalyst was coated by the carbon layer during the synthesis process (hydrothermal and calcination). Once the carbon formed a coating layer, it could prevent the metal from sintering, leaching and growing up. This structure displayed highly dispersed abundant active sites, thus contributing to the excellent activity catalyst performance.Co@NPC exhibited excellent performance in reaction. It can achieve 92.1% conversion of cinnamaldehyde and 79.7% selectivity of cinnamaldehyde respectively under the reaction conditions of 80\u2103, 0.5 MPa hydrogen pressure and 5 h. Compared with the catalyst Co@C without doping, N, P co-doping can significantly improve the catalytic performance and control the activity and selectivity of the reaction by adjusting the doping amount.In addition, the researchers proved that P doping could improve the selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol, while N doping was closely related to the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed that the electronegativity difference between N, P and C atoms led to the interaction between electrons and changed the ratio of Co and CoO in the catalyst, thereby changing the adsorption strength of cinnamaldehyde on the surface of the catalyst. The reaction products can be adjusted according to the difference of adsorption energy.This study showed that doping of non-metallic atoms made it possible to regulate the electronic structure of catalyst, which provides a new strategy for the design of catalyst for selective hydrogenation of biomass derivatives.

  "text": "Aramid fiber is known as \"super fiber,\" or \"golden silk,\" because even though its weight is equivalent to only 20% of the weight of steel, it is more than five times as strong and does not burn, even at 500\u00b0C. Aramid fiber is an essential material used in various applications such as body armor, fire-resistant clothing, fiber optic cable reinforcement, high-performance tires, and aerospace materials. The late Dr. Han-Sik Yun began researching aramid fiber at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in 1979 and secured independent source technology in 1984.       Dr. Dae-Yoon Kim and his research team at the Functional Composite Materials Research Center within the KIST Jeonbuk Institute of Advanced Composite Materials announced that they have applied carbon nanotubes to aramid fibers to develop a new kind of composite fiber. The findings are published in the journal Advanced Fiber Materials.In addition to being lightweight, strong, and fire-resistant, the fiber also has electrical conductivity, which is a first for conventional aramid fibers. The newly developed fiber is black in color due to the presence of carbon nanotubes.                Mechanical and electrical properties of \"black fiber.\" Credit: Korea Institute of Science and Technology             Inspired by the characteristics of a silkworm cocoon, the KIST research team succeeded in combining aramid, which has extremely low dispersibility, with carbon nanotubes. By utilizing the liquid crystal phase, silkworms produce high-strength fiber using high-concentration protein. Possessing both liquid-like fluidity and crystal-like order, the liquid crystal minimizes the coagulation of aramid and carbon nanotubes as well as improves the alignment.Utilizing these characteristics, the research team created a new type of composite fiber with high level of specific strength similar to that of existing commercial aramid fibers, as well as a specific electrical conductivity level of approximately 90% of that of copper wires.

Credit: Korea Institute of Science and Technology             Despite these electrical characteristics, this next-generation aramid fiber does not use any metals, resulting in flexibility, non-corrosiveness, and a lightweight profile (approximately 30% of the weight of copper wires). It is expected to be used as a next-generation wire in various applications, such as smart military, medical robots, eco-friendly mobility, and aerospace technologies.

  "text": "A team of chemical engineers affiliated with several institutions in Europe has determined why Old Masters of the 16th, 17th, and early 18th centuries added egg yolk to their oil-based paints. In their study, reported in the journal Nature Communications, the group added fresh egg yolk to the types of oils used by Renaissance painters and tested them to see changes it made to their properties.       For many years, historians have known that the Old Masters of the Renaissance, such as Sandro Botticelli or Leonardo da Vinci, added proteins such as egg yolk to their oil-based paints\u2014creating a medium known as egg tempera\u2014but no one knew why. In this new effort, the chemists set themselves the task of solving the mystery.The work involved creating two types of oil-based paints, both with yolk added. One mixture consisted of nothing but yolk and oil. The other had yolk, oil and pigments to add coloring. The team also created similar paints without using egg yolk. The group then used the paints to create paintings that could be used for testing purposes. Such tests included taking measurements of moisture amounts and movement, oxidation, time to dry and heat capacity.Preparation of an oil paint and a capillary suspension (CapS) paint. Credit: Oph\u00e9lie Ranquet et al., Nature CommunicationsThe researchers found that adding yolk helped to create stronger bonding between pigment particles, which made for stiffer paint. And that, they noted, would have been ideal for use in impasto painting, where the ink is applied thickly to give it a three-dimensional quality. The group also found that adding yolk reduced wrinkling of the paint, helping it to retain the shape applied by the painter\u2014and helped to protect the paint against exposure to high humidity. Antioxidants in the yolk also helped to prevent yellowing.Adding egg yolk also allowed the painter, the team found, to add more pigment to the oil, which in turn, helped to create more vivid images.

  "text": "Enzymes work in the cells of all living organisms, allowing specific and complex reactions to be carried out quite easily. However, few natural enzymes are effective for industrial applications, which could benefit greatly from discoveries that make targeted enzyme creation a reality.          Artificial metalloenzymes can be created simply by binding metal ions or metallic compounds to proteins, so that they exhibit enzymatic activity. Currently, metalloenzymes are being studied to discover new functions or to improve their reactivity when compared to natural enzymes. Nevertheless, the reaction mechanisms of metalloenzymes are still largely unknown, making it very difficult to design artificial enzymes for specific functions or improved efficiency.A research group led by Professor Nobutaka Fujieda, Graduate School of Agriculture, Osaka Metropolitan University, has been creating artificial metalloenzymes using small heat-resistant metal-binding proteins. In their latest study, they describe an artificial metalloenzyme they created simply, making use of the 2-His-1-carboxylate metal-binding motif, which is commonly found naturally in non-heme metalloenzymes. The research results were published in Chemical Science on March 13, 2023.Their new artificial metalloenzyme has a metal-binding site composed of four amino acids, which originally were histidines. The research group mutated these amino acids to create a library of 12 slightly different proteins to compare. After screening the library, they found that the enzyme variant H52A/H58E, when bound with a copper ion, had the best stereoselectivity, so that it reacts selectively with the correct version of the target molecule.The research group then performed X-ray crystallographic analysis of the metal-binding site, confirming two electron densities derived from the copper ions. Furthermore, docking simulations of two copper ions found that the copper, which protruded slightly, could bind to the substrate, leading the group to believe that selectivity was maximized by the movement of the copper ion to where the substrate was most likely to bind.\"Such positional transitions of metal ions have also been observed in natural enzymes, so we believe that detailed analysis of our artificial metalloenzyme's reaction mechanism will deepen what we know about natural enzymes. We hope that the advances of this research will lead to the creation of biocatalysts that can work under mild conditions,\" Professor Fujieda concluded.

  "text": "All biological amino acids on Earth appear exclusively in their left-handed form, but the reason underlying this observation is elusive. Recently, scientists from Japan uncovered new clues about the cosmic origin of this asymmetry. Based on the optical properties of amino acids found on the Murchison meteorite, they conducted physics-based simulations, revealing that the precursors to the biological amino acids may have determined the amino acid chirality during the early phase of galactic evolution.          If you look at your hands, you will notice that they are mirror images of each other. However, no matter how hard you try to flip and rotate one hand, you will never be able to superimpose it perfectly over the other. Many molecules have a similar property called \"chirality,\" which means that the \"left-handed\" (L) version of a molecule cannot be superimposed onto its \"right-handed\" (D) mirror image version. Even though both versions of a chiral molecule, called \"enantiomers,\" have the same chemical formula, the way they interact with other molecules, especially with other chiral molecules, can vary immensely.Interestingly, one of the many mysteries surrounding the origin of life as we know it has to do with chirality. It turns out that biological amino acids (AAs)\u2014the building blocks of proteins\u2014on Earth appear only in one of their two possible enantiomeric forms, namely the L-form. However, if you synthesize AAs artificially, both L and D forms are produced in equal amounts. This suggests that, at some early point in the past, L-AAs must have come to dominate a hetero-chiral world. This phenomenon is known as \"chiral symmetry breaking.\"Against this backdrop, a research team led by Assistant Professor Mitsuo Shoji from University of Tsukuba, Japan, conducted a study aimed at solving this mystery. As explained in their paper published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, the team sought to find evidence supporting the cosmic origin of the homochirality of AAs on Earth, as well as iron out some inconsistencies and contradictions in our previous understanding.\"The idea that homochirality may have originated in space was suggested after AAs were found in the Murchison meteorite that fell in Australia in 1969,\" explains Dr. Shoji. Curiously enough, in the samples obtained from this meteorite, each of the L-enantiomers was more prevalent than its D-enantiomer counterpart. One popular explanation for this suggests that the asymmetry was induced by ultraviolet circularly polarized light (CPL) in the star-forming regions of our galaxy. Scientists verified that this type of radiation can, indeed, induce asymmetric photochemical reactions that, given enough time, would favor the production of L-AAs over D-AAs. However, the absorption properties of the AA isovaline are opposite to those of the other AAs, meaning that the UV-based explanation alone is either insufficient or incorrect.      Against this backdrop, Dr. Shoji's team pursued an alternate hypothesis. Instead of far-UV radiation, they hypothesized that the chiral asymmetry was, in fact, induced specifically by the CP Lyman-\u03b1 (Ly\u03b1) emission line, a spectral line of hydrogen atom that permeated the early Milky Way. Moreover, instead of focusing only on photoreactions in AAs, the researchers investigated the possibility of the chiral asymmetry starting in the precursors to the AAs, namely amino propanals (APs) and amino nitriles (ANs).Through quantum mechanical calculations, the team analyzed Ly\u03b1-induced reactions for producing AAs along the chemical pathway adopted in Strecker synthesis. They then noted the ratios of L- to D-enantiomers of AAs, APs, and ANs at each step of the process.The results showed that L-enantiomers of ANs are preferentially formed under right-handed CP (R-CP) Ly\u03b1 irradiation, with their enantiomeric ratios matching those for the corresponding AAs. \"Taken together, our findings suggest that ANs underlie the origin of the homochirality,\" remarks Dr. Shoji. \"More specifically, irradiating AN precursors with R-CP Ly\u03b1 radiation lead to a higher ratio of L-enantiomers. The subsequent predominance of L-AAs is possible via reactions induced by water molecules and heat.\"The study thus brings us one step closer to understanding the complex history of our own biochemistry. The team emphasizes that more studies focused on ANs need to be conducted on future samples from asteroids and comets to validate their findings. \"Further analyses and theoretical investigations of ANs and other prebiotic molecules related to sugars and nucleobases will provide new insights into the chemical evolution of molecules and, in turn, the origin of life,\" concludes Dr. Shoji.

The work could help increase production of the drink and make it more readily available for everyone to enjoy.

And with fermented coffee becoming more popular in competitive events, some people have been concerned that the lack of knowledge about fermented coffee may make it difficult to distinguish between the genuine product and regular joe that has been illicitly adulterated. So, Yeretzian and colleagues from the Coffee Excellence Center at Zurich University of Applied Sciences sought to identify the compounds that are responsible for these new and exciting flavors. And because flavor and smell are intimately linked, studying the beverages' scents could help the team gain a better understanding of how fermented coffee's complex flavor is created.To single out the compounds unique to fermented coffee's aromas, researchers took arabica beans and divided them into three groups. One was prepared using a wash process, which is likely how the average afternoon pick-me-up brew is made. Here, a gelatinous substance known as mucilage is stripped from the coffee bean, which is washed with water before being dried.The researchers prepared the second group using the pulped natural process\u2014another common approach\u2014in which the skin is removed from the bean, but the mucilage is left intact.Finally, the team fermented beans in the third group using carbonic maceration, a process often used in winemaking. This method was first introduced to the specialty coffee world in 2015, when the winning contestant in the World Barista Championship used it to prepare their entry. With this process, whole coffee fruits are fermented in stainless steel tanks and infused with carbon dioxide to lower the pH of the fermentation. Unlike the other brews, the coffee made with fermented beans was described as smelling intense, like raspberries with a hint of rose.      Next, the researchers brewed coffee using each type of bean and analyzed the samples with gas chromatography (GC) sniffing, also called GC olfactometry. First, the GC instrument separated individual components in the air above each sample. Then, as the compounds left the instrument, they went to a mass spectrometer for identification, and to someone sitting at the outlet to describe what they smelled.\"Because the chemical signature doesn't tell us how a compound smells, we have to rely on the human nose to detect the scent as each compound comes out of the chromatography instrument individually,\" says Yeretzian. This methodology can be tricky because there is a subjective element to it. \"We're using people to detect scents, and everybody perceives flavors a little differently,\" says Samo Smrke, Ph.D., a research associate in the lab who is presenting the results. \"But in this case, the panel was very consistent in the smells they described. So, what is traditionally considered a challenge was actually not an issue because the aromas were so clear.\"There is one major advantage to GC sniffing. The human nose can sometimes detect scents from compounds that are at such a low concentration, they're unable to be picked up by mass spectrometry. In this case, although six compounds appeared to contribute to the intense fruity flavor and the raspberry scent of the fermented coffee, the team was only able to identify three of them: 2-methylpropanal, 3-methylbutanal and ethyl 3-methylbutanoate.In the future, the researchers hope to identify the remaining compounds, as well as judge the intensity of different flavors and scents. Additionally, the researchers would like to know more about how these unique compounds form. Potential factors include farming practices, the variety of coffee beans, the microclimate of specific farms and the microbes present during fermentation.\"There's still quite a lot of unknowns surrounding this process,\" says Smrke. A better understanding of the sources of these compounds could help the team standardize production methods, making it easier to produce fermented coffee at larger scales and allowing even more people to enjoy this distinctive flavor.

The University of Queensland's Professor Craig Williams said the platform, developed in collaboration with CSIRO, is developing an exciting set of tools for chemists who, in many cases, had been running out of new chemical building block options.\"Chemists have often relied on hydrocarbons, substances like petrochemicals, throughout history to build new critically important chemicals for society,\" Professor Williams said.\"But one key hydrocarbon that's been historically missing from this mix is cubane\u2014a synthetic hydrocarbon in the shape of a cube.\"Cubane traditionally was overlooked, as there was no way to synthesize this molecule on a large scale and so its application was limited.\"This has since changed as Australian chemists at CSIRO reported a kilogram scale synthesis, which is now in production at Boron Molecular in Melbourne, that enabled a significant upsurge of cubane research in the twenty-first century.\"For the first time, the team at UQ successfully incorporated a nitrogen atom into a close relative of cubane, which has the long-term potential of improving the properties of this class of molecules for use in biological systems.\"Hydrocarbons find success within a wide selection of drugs, but the nature of an all-carbon atom core can impede some biological interactions and restrict their application in drug and agrochemical discovery,\" Professor Williams said.

  "text": "The fruit of the cocklebur plant, which grows worldwide and is often considered a noxious weed, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory components that could make it useful as a skin protectant, according to new research.          Researchers found that compounds in the species' spiky fruits reduced damage from UVB exposure and sped wound healing in laboratory tests using cells and tissues. The cocklebur extracts also appear to influence the production of collagen, a protein that gives skin its elasticity and prevents wrinkles.\"We found that cocklebur fruit has the potential to protect the skin and help enhance production of collagen,\" said Eunsu Song, a doctoral candidate at Myongji University in South Korea, who conducted the research with Myongji University Professsor Jinah Hwang. \"In this regard, it could be an attractive ingredient for creams or other cosmetic forms. It will likely show a synergistic effect if it is mixed with other effective compounds, such as hyaluronic acid or retinoic acid, against aging.\"Song will present the new research at Discover BMB, the annual meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, March 25\u201328 in Seattle.Cocklebur is a plant native to Southern Europe, Central Asia and China that has spread worldwide, often found in moist or sandy areas such as roadside ditches and riverbanks. Its distinctive fruits, covered in stiff husks and burrs, have been used for centuries in traditional medicines for headache, stuffy nose, disorders of skin pigmentation, tuberculosis-related illness and rheumatoid arthritis. In recent years scientists have explored its potential use in treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.The new study is the first to examine the fruit's properties as a wound-healing agent and skin protectant. Researchers first studied the molecular properties of cocklebur fruit extracts and isolated particular compounds that could contribute to anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. They then used cell cultures and a 3D tissue model with properties similar to human skin to study how these compounds affect collagen production, wound healing and damage from UVB radiation.The results showed that the cocklebur fruit extracts encouraged collagen production, sped wound healing and exerted a protective effect against UVB radiation. Comparing the bioactivity of cocklebur fruits grown in different places, the researchers found that fruits grown in South Korea had slightly higher anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and greater wound-healing activity than those grown in China.Researchers cautioned that high doses of cocklebur fruit extract can be harmful and further research is needed to determine how to use it safely in cosmetic or pharmaceutical applications.\"In its burrs, cocklebur fruit also has a toxic constituent, carboxyatractyloside, which can damage the liver,\" said Song. \"Cocklebur showed a potential as a cosmetic agent by increasing collagen synthesis; however, it showed negative results with higher concentrations. Therefore, finding the proper concentration seems very important and would be key to commercializing cocklebur fruit extracts in cosmetics.\"Moving forward, the researchers plan to further study the biological mechanisms involved and conduct experiments in animal alternatives to explore ways to safely adapt cocklebur fruit extracts for use in cosmetic products.

  "text": "New research has revealed important information about how aspirin works. Even though this drug has been available commercially since the late 1800s, scientists have not yet fully elucidated its detailed mechanism of action and cellular targets. The new findings could pave the way to safer aspirin alternatives and might also have implications for improving cancer immunotherapies.          Aspirin, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is one of the most widely used medications in the world. It is used to treat pain, fever and inflammation, and an estimated 29 million people in the U.S. take it daily to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.Scientists know that aspirin inhibits the cyclooxygenase enzyme, or COX, which creates messenger molecules that are crucial in the inflammatory response. Researchers led by Subhrangsu Mandal, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Texas at Arlington, have discovered more about this process.Prarthana Guha, a graduate student in Mandal's lab, will present the team's findings at Discover BMB, the annual meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, March 25\u201328 in Seattle. Avisankar Chini also made significant contributions to the study.\"Aspirin is a magic drug, but long-term use of it can cause detrimental side effects such as internal bleeding and organ damage,\" Mandal said. \"It's important that we understand how it works so we can develop safer drugs with fewer side effects.\"The team found that aspirin controls transcription factors required for cytokine expression during inflammation while also influencing many other inflammatory proteins and noncoding RNAs that are critically linked to inflammation and immune response. Mandal said this work has required a unique interdisciplinary team with expertise in inflammation signaling biology and organic chemistry.They also showed that aspirin slows the breakdown of the amino acid tryptophan into its metabolite kynurenine by inhibiting associated enzymes called indoleamine dioxygenases, or IDOs. Tryptophan metabolism plays a central role in the inflammation and immune response.\"We found that aspirin downregulates IDO1 expression and associated kynurenine production during inflammation,\" Mandal said. \"Since aspirin is a COX inhibitor, this suggests potential interplay between COX and IDO1 during inflammation.\"IDO1 is an important target for immunotherapy, a type of cancer treatment that helps the body's immune system seek out and destroy cancer cells. Because COX inhibitors modulate the COX\u2013IDO1 axis during inflammation, the researchers predict that COX inhibitors might also be useful as drugs for immunotherapy.Mandal and his team are now creating a series of small molecules that modulate COX\u2013IDO1 and will explore their potential use as anti-inflammatory drugs and immunotherapeutic agents.

  "text": "Bioactive compounds present mostly in fruit and vegetables perform different bodily functions relating to health and well-being. Their effects are considered antioxidant, antidiabetic, antiaging and anticancer, among others.          Many studies are looking for ways to optimize absorption of bioactive compounds by the organism and increase their bioavailability\u2014the proportion that enters the bloodstream after absorption. One way is to coat the compounds with another material and package them on the nanometric scale (a nanometer is a billionth of a meter). Nanoencapsulation, as this technique is known, assures slow release of the compounds so that they take longer to digest and can survive the attacks of bacteria in the gut microbiome.An investigation conducted by a duo of researchers at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCF-USP) in Brazil is one of these studies. Working at the school's Department of Food Science and Experimental Nutrition, they have produced several articles on the subject\u2014the latest of which, published in the International Journal of Biological Macromolecules, is a review of the literature on pectin-based nanoencapsulation plus a description of a novel technology developed under the aegis of the Food Research Center (FoRC), a Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center (RIDC).\"We used pectin extracted from residues of citrus fruit albedo and peel, with a degree of purity permitting human ingestion and excluding any kind of hazardous chemical,\" said Jo\u00e3o Paulo Fabi, one of the authors and a professor at FCF-USP. Albedo is the layer of white spongy material inside the peels of oranges and lemons, for example.\"In addition to our review of the literature, we describe a novel technology for nanoencapsulation of bioactive compounds using pectin. This entails producing a pectin-lysozyme complex as a protective outer layer for a highly sensitive bioactive compound called anthocyanin,\" he explained, adding that lysozyme is \"a safely edible substance obtained from egg white and used to enhance the stability of the end-product.\"Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments belonging to the flavonoid family. They are phenolic compounds found in all plants and responsible for the shades of red, blue and purple seen in flowers, fruit, leaves, stalks and roots.The authors say their methodology can be used to encapsulate other water-soluble bioactive compounds. \"We tested anthocyanin because of its challenging sensitivity to many factors, such as light, temperature, pH and gut bacteria,\" said Thi\u00e9cla Katiane Osvaldt Rosales, the other author. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Nuclear and Energy Research Institute (IPEN).      Advantages of methodologyAccording to the researchers, the main advantage of their methodology is that no other compounds are added apart from pectin, lysozyme and anthocyanin. \"We used three compounds from sources in nature and mixed them in the laboratory to form a new product, without adding salts, ligands or anything potentially toxic. Furthermore, the nanoparticles are not too small. Very tiny nanoparticles can penetrate barriers and cell membranes, entering the DNA and having toxic effects. The size we obtained is safe,\" Fabi said.Rosales outlined the process they developed to produce the nanoparticles. \"Pectin and lysozyme are heated separately. The increase in temperature partly alters their structure, and they interact better when heated. They are then rapidly cooled to reach a temperature not harmful to anthocyanin, which is sensitive and fairly unstable. The three substances are blended in an aqueous suspension and agitated for an hour. The result is encapsulated anthocyanin. The suspension is then filtered to separate the non-encapsulated contents,\" she said.Special care is taken with factors such as temperature and pH. \"We tested the parameters for the purpose of optimization, especially pH. If pH is too high, the anthocyanin breaks down. It can't be too low, either. We found a pH of 5 to be optimal for interaction between the molecules,\" she explained. \"We also tested the duration and intensity of the agitation. We made a point of managing all the details, however minor, because they make a difference in terms of forming stable particles. We've applied for a patent on the methodology.\"ResultsFinally, the encapsulation was tested for efficacy in a digestion system simulated in the laboratory to mimic the gastric and intestinal phases. \"The result was that part of the anthocyanin was released during the digestive process, at the end of gastric digestion, and part remained in the nanostructure, with the possibility of release of this remainder in the gut or absorption together with the nanostructure. We believe this was a good outcome. Partial and gradual release suggests absorption of the compound starts before it enters the gut, with the nanoencapsulated remainder probably being released in the gut or fully absorbed with less structural alteration,\" Rosales said.The next step will be animal testing. \"We tested the method in vitro and obtained results indicating that the nanoparticles are safe for consumption. We have evidence that cells can absorb them in a non-toxic manner and that the pectin protects the anthocyanin and its properties. We now have to test it in animals, observing the process of oral ingestion, absorption of the anthocyanin using specific markers for absorption, and the route followed in the organism. It's important to verify the extent of absorption and the biological destination,\" she said.The nanoparticles are mainly intended for use as a food supplement. \"They can be added to food and dietary supplements, but industrial mass production would be necessary to include them in a supplement,\" Fabi said.It is worth noting that the method does not require expensive equipment or procedures. \"In addition, the material used for the nanocapsules, which comes from byproducts of citrus peel, would make the cost even lower for manufacturers. The pectin we used in our study is available commercially and is used by the food industry, mostly for gel formation in jam or as a thickener,\" Rosales said.

  "answer_squad": " absorb the moisture generated in it",
  "text": "Pads incorporated into fresh meat packaging, whose function is to absorb the moisture generated in it, and that can cause food spoilage, are generally composed of plastic polymers derived from petroleum by-products.          In today's world, in which European and national regulations and international agreements call for a future in which plastics are avoided, to avert their negative effects on human health and the environment, the Biopren research group in the Chemical Engineering Area of the University of Cordoba has developed natural-waste padding that not only absorbs moisture, like conventional pads do, but also delays the oxidation of the meat.This innovation, which is still in the concept development phase, uses organic waste, thus favoring the efficient use of resources and bolstering the Circular Economy.To this end, the pads developed, whose shape is similar to that of make-up removers, and are called aerogels, are composed of three basic elements. First, the base is made of chitosan, a polymer derived from crustacean shells. Compared to the plastic polymers used in commercial pads, the study uses a natural one. Chitosan, however, does have some disadvantages, including its irregular structure, and the fact that it is more soluble in water, and is weaker.                The researchers Luis Serrano and Esther Rinc\u00f3n with the pads developed. Credit: University of Cordoba             To counteract this, the research team added the other two elements: nanocellulose from laurel pruning -one of the most widely grown aromatic and medicinal plant crops in the Mediterranean area- and bay leaf essential oil, which make the pad stiffer and more durable, and delay oxidation of the meat.With these three elements, explains Esther Rinc\u00f3n of the research group, \"what we have managed to do is to keep the meat in a fresh state, like at the beginning, after ten days of refrigerated storage.\"The study, which has been published on the cover of the journal Polymers, is a first step, a proof of concept. Future studies will need to focus on the safety and healthiness of the pads to verify, for example, that no components seep into the meat that might produce allergic reactions.

  "answer_squad": " C3N4",
  "text": "H2O2 is not only a green oxidant that is widely used in environmental remediation, industrial synthesis, and medical healthcare, etc., but also an emerging energy carrier with a high energy density comparable to compressed H2.          At present, anthraquinone oxidation is still the primary route for large-scale H2O2 production, which requires a high energy input and creates a lot of harmful pollutants. As an alternative, photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and O2 has been considered as a green, safe, and energy-saving strategy for sustainable H2O2 production, and has attracted growing interest over the past years.However, the photocatalytic efficiency is still far from meeting the practical requirements. The exploration of efficient semiconductor photocatalysts with superior optoelectronic properties is the key to achieving desirable photocatalytic performance.Among many candidates, carbon nitride (C3N4) has been the main research focus for photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. Specially, the heptazine units in C3N4 play a critical role of active sites to facilitate the selective oxygen reduction.Moreover, the metal-free nature of C3N4 could also protect the generated H2O2 from fast decomposition caused by transition-metal sites like in inorganic semiconductors. However, C3N4 photocatalysts usually suffer from narrow light absorption and fast charge recombination due to insufficient conjugation, leading to unsatisfactory photocatalytic performance.On the basis of the understanding of the inherent merits and pitfalls of C3N4, Prof. Yanguang Li from Soochow University, China and his coworkers proposed a new photocatalyst design strategy that integrating the active heptazine units and functional linkers into crystalline conjugated polymer frameworks.The highly conjugated molecular structure could improve the electron delocalization thorough the organic skeletons and increase the light absorption; furthermore, the ordered interlayer \u03c0-\u03c0 would provide high-speed channels for charge transfer, thereby decreasing their recombination.By comparison with the pristine C3N4, the resultant sample (denoted as COF-TpHt) exhibits a broader light absorption up to 800 nm and much improved charge separation efficiency as demonstrated by a series of spectroscopic measurements. Under the visible-light irradiation, COF-TpHt exhibits a high H2O2 production rate of 11986 \u03bcmol h\u20131 g\u20131 and an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) up to 38% at 420 nm, both of which are superior to other reported organic and inorganic counterparts.Impressively, COF-TpHt shows excellent stability that enables almost linear H2O2 accumulation during a long time irradiation, giving rise to a H2O2 concentration of over 59 mM after 30 h. This research has been published in Chinese Journal of Catalysis.

  "text": "A team of researchers from the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, the University of Vienna, and Sirius University of Science and Technology has published a study in the Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design that presents guidelines for enhancing the drug discovery process by utilizing multitask learning techniques.          In universities, students often take related courses, such as physics and mathematics, which leads to a better understanding of both subjects. Similarly, learning a new language is easier for those who have already had experience with languages, particularly cognate ones. The same principle applies to machine learning, where a neural network can better comprehend multiple \"subjects\" if it learns them simultaneously. Considering that neural networks are one of the best approaches for predicting the biological properties of new chemical compounds, the question arises: How can we assist a neural network in simultaneously learning and predicting the properties of chemical compounds in relation to multiple biological targets?Researchers analyzed three datasets for this purpose: a dataset with information on the antiviral activity of molecules and two datasets with information on the impact of molecules on various proteins in our body. The datasets varied in the completeness of information on each protein or virus. During the study, scientists discovered that adding data to the dataset is an effective method for improving prediction accuracy. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the more informative the original dataset is, the more noticeable this improvement. As a result of this work, the research team prepared a set of recommendations for using data enrichment technology to improve the quality and stability of predictions, as well as methods for objectively evaluating the improvement achieved.\"Multitask learning is widely used in many scientific fields. Unsurprisingly, it is increasingly being applied to develop new drugs. However, the potential of this approach has not yet been fully explored, presenting us with numerous unresolved tasks,\" the lead author of the study, Skoltech Ph.D. candidate Ekaterina Sosnina, notes. \"We were inspired by the possibility of using multitask learning to develop new drug candidates and searched for ways to improve this approach.

  "text": "Throw another mammoth on the barbie? An Australian company on Tuesday lifted the glass cloche on a meatball made of lab-grown cultured meat using the genetic sequence from the long-extinct pachyderm, saying it was meant to fire up public debate about the hi-tech treat.          The launch in an Amsterdam science museum came just days before April 1 so there was an elephant in the room: Is this for real?\"This is not an April Fools joke,\" said Tim Noakesmith, founder of Australian startup Vow. \"This is a real innovation.\"Cultivated meat\u2014also called cultured or cell-based meat\u2014is made from animal cells. Livestock doesn't need to be killed to produce it, which advocates say is better not just for the animals but also for the environment.Vow used publicly available genetic information from the mammoth, filled missing parts with genetic data from its closest living relative, the African elephant, and inserted it into a sheep cell, Noakesmith said. Given the right conditions in a lab, the cells multiplied until there were enough to roll up into the meatball.More than 100 companies around the world are working on cultivated meat products, many of them startups like Vow.Experts say that if the technology is widely adopted, it could vastly reduce the environmental impact of global meat production in the future. Currently, billions of acres of land are used for agriculture worldwide.                A meatball made using genetic code from the mammoth is seen at the Nemo science museum in Amsterdam, Tuesday March 28, 2023.

So far, tiny Singapore is the only country to have approved cell-based meat for consumption. Vow is hoping to sell its first product there\u2014a cultivated Japanese quail meat\u2014later this year.The mammoth meatball is a one-off and has not been tasted, even by its creators, nor is it planned to be put into commercial production. Instead, it was presented as a source of protein that would get people talking about the future of meat.\"We wanted to get people excited about the future of food being different to potentially what we had before. That there are things that are unique and better than the meats that we're necessarily eating now, and we thought the mammoth would be a conversation starter and get people excited about this new future,\" Noakesmith told The Associated Press.\"But also the woolly mammoth has been traditionally a symbol of loss. We know now that it died from climate change. And so what we wanted to do was see if we could create something that was a symbol of a more exciting future that's not only better for us, but also better for the planet,\" he added.      Seren Kell, science and technology manager at Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that promotes plant- and cell-based alternatives to animal products, said he hopes the project \"will open up new conversations about cultivated meat's extraordinary potential to produce more sustainable foods, reduce the climate impact of our existing food system and free up land for less intensive farming practices.\"He said the mammoth project with its unconventional gene source was an outlier in the new meat cultivation sector, which commonly focuses on traditional livestock\u2014cattle, pigs and poultry.

Unlike Pfizer's antiviral treatment Paxlovid, which is only useful during the first three days of showing symptoms, this possible new medication could reduce the course of the virus upon exposure.          \"Neutralizing small molecules may provide immediate protection against viral infection, and thus be suitable for people of all ages, and may be particularly suitable for high-risk populations and immunocompromised individuals who typically do not generate sufficient antibodies after vaccination,\" said McConnell in Biomedicines. \"This exciting new small molecule drug candidate has the potential to be developed into an alternative drug treatment for COVID-19.\"The molecule's discovery began during the height of the pandemic when students in the McConnell lab were working from home and an idea hatched that perhaps a tiny molecule could impact the virus. The team screened 1,509,984 feature-rich compounds in the UH Research Computing Data Core, home of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Data Science Institute.The team searched for a molecule that could interrupt the interaction between the spike protein, located on the outside of the coronavirus, and its human target to enter into human cells, the ACE2 protein.\"Our team is thrilled with the discovery of a small molecule therapeutic that inhibits the interaction between the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus and the ACE2 receptor of the infected individual,\" said McConnell. \"We are grateful that the University had the high-performance computing power available on campus to advance our work so effectively. This is a discovery that could ultimately impact many lives.\"McConnell's team includes Arfaxad Reyes-Alcaraz, Hanan Qasim, Elizabeth Merlinsky, Tasneem Islam, and Bryan Medina from the UH College of Pharmacy; Robert J. Schwartz, John W. Craft, Jr. from the UH Department of Biology and Biochemistry; and Glenn Fox, Rogers State University in Oklahoma.During the experimentation phase, the team selected the top 15 molecules that disrupted the interaction between the spike protein and the ACE2 receptor. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed that some of the compounds from these libraries had favorable interactions with the spike protein's ACE receptor binding domain interface, leading to a potential neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and one particular molecule rose to the top: CD04872SC, which formed the closest association.\"We were able to experimentally observe that CD04872SC also inhibited the infection of the SARS-CoV-2 variants delta and omicron,\" said Reyes-Alcaraz, the study's first author.\"To demonstrate the binding between CD04872SC and the spike proteins of each variant, we performed a thermal shift assay which measures changes in the thermal denaturation temperature, serving as an indicator of the stability of a protein under varying conditions such as when bound by a drug, pH, ionic strength, or sequence mutation,\" said Craft, associate professor in the Department of Biology and Biochemistry.It's a medical discovery whose time has come.The SARS-CoV-2 virus and variants delta and omicron are still a major threat to patients of all ages. The variants demonstrate how easily the virus can accommodate antigenic changes in its spike protein without the loss of fitness.\"The omicron variant has particularly stressed health care systems around the world. Therefore, identifying effective antiviral agents to combat this infectious disease is urgently needed,\" said McConnell.For the future, McConnell suggests further development of molecule derivatives and preclinical trials.\"This promising drug candidate lead should be developed into a family of derivatives that could be further refined, possibly leading to a more efficacious and cost-effective alternative to expensive neutralizing treatments,\" said McConnell.

  "text": "A team of chemical and biomolecular engineers at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has developed a scalable way to use bacteria to convert CO2 in the air into a polyester. In their paper, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the group describes their technique and outline its performance when tested over a several-hour period.          As climate change progresses, scientists around the world continue to look for ways to both prevent emissions and to scrub emissions from the air. In this new effort, the researchers took another look at the possibility of using Cupriavidus necator, a type of bacteria, to pull CO2 from the air and then to use it to make a type of polyester.Prior research has shown that C. necator can pull in CO2 and use it to make certain types of biodegradable plastics. But the process can only be done in batches because of the need for electricity to start the process\u2014toxic byproducts build up and kill the bacteria. This prevents the process from scaling. In this new effort, the research team in Korea overcame this problem.The workaround involved adding a synthetic membrane at the start of the process that separates the bacteria from the toxic byproducts. This led to a two-sided process. On one side, chemical reactions prepared CO2 for fermentation, while the other side held other needed ingredients. The membrane then allowed the ingredients to flow slowly to the side with the bacteria, which used them to make bits of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate.The research team ran the process, which involved periodically removing bacteria holding onto the PHB and adding fresh empty samples, for 18 days. They found it worked as planned and also made 11.5 mg of PHB per hour. The researchers note that the process does still require electricity but because it is so much more efficient than other methods, the cost of converting CO2 to a polyester was much cheaper. They also note that the process can be easily scaled up.

  "answer_squad": " CDg18",
  "text": "M1 and M2 are activated macrophages that protect our immune system and maintain homeostasis. Interestingly, they are characterized by distinct and opposing phenotypes. M1 macrophages are known for their bactericidal and tumoricidal properties by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, while M2 macrophages facilitate immunosuppressive responses and help cancer progression.          As such, reprogramming macrophages from M2 to M1 phenotype has been regarded as a significant interest in the view of potential cancer treatment methods. Though it has been challenging to distinguish between living M1 and M2 using fluorescent molecules until now, a research team at POSTECH has developed a novel probe, selectively dyeing M2 over M1 for the first time.The work of the team, including Professor Young-Tae Chang (Department of Chemistry), Professor Nam-Young Kang (Department of Convergence IT Engineering), Professor Haw-Young Kwon, Heewon Cho and Sun Hyeok Lee from the Department of Interdisciplinary Bioscience & Bioengineering at POSTECH, has developed the first M2 selective probe CDg18 with a novel mechanism. The research findings were recently published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.Fluorescent probes are chemical compounds that are able to emit light upon recognition of specific ions or materials. The discrimination of living human cells is of importance, not only in clinical diagnosis but the pursuit of effective treatment strategies for infections or inflammatory conditions.Macrophages are specialized immune cells, exhibiting remarkable plasticity in response to environmental stimuli. The activated macrophages broadly categorize into two different subsets, M1 and M2. M1 macrophages have aggressive functions against invaders such as bacteria and tumors while M2 macrophages are anti-inflammatory cells, which promote tumor immunity.Tumor-associated macrophages represent a critical determinant to form tumor microenvironment, which is a typical example of M2 cells. Despite the evident importance of M2 macrophages, real-time monitoring of M2 had remained a challenge.The team developed a novel M2 probe, CDg18, by employing a unique mechanism of Gating-Oriented Live-cell Distinction (GOLD) through the specific overexpressed fatty acid transporter in M2. To demonstrate the potential of CDg18, the team visualized the phenotypic shift of M2 toward M1 using a resveratrol analog HS-1973 as a reprogramming effector.The simultaneous use of both CDg18 and the M1 probe, CDr17, facilitated dual-color monitoring macrophage reprogramming in real time that was defined by the diminishing M2 character and emergence of M1 markers.Professor Young-Tae Chang who led the team explained, \"The M2 probe (and the M1 probe previously developed) developed by the team in this research enables the monitoring of M1 and M2 distribution in cancerous tissues as well as their changes over time.\" He added, \"This represents a novel technological approach in addressing the existing limitations in this field.\" More information:Heewon Cho et al, Development of a Fluorescent Probe for M2 Macrophages via Gating-Oriented Live-Cell Distinction, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2023).

  "text": "From fiber optic cables to smartphones, glass is playing a major role in emerging technology. To learn more about how glass will shape future society, we spoke with Katelyn Kirchner, a doctoral candidate at Penn State, who is studying with John Mauro, Penn State's Dorothy Pate Enright Professor of Materials Science and Engineering. Kirchner is lead author and Mauro corresponding author on a recent review article on the unique properties of glass published in the journal Chemical Reviews.          The article, which was published in print last month and co-authored with an international team of scientists, is the first comprehensive look at the spatial and temporal fluctuations of glass. It is a review of experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches to characterize and demonstrate the effects of various types of fluctuations on physical properties and processes, focusing primarily on commercially relevant oxide glasses.Let's start with the basics. What is glass?That's a wonderfully complicated question. The exact definition is something that is still being explored today. A glass is a non-equilibrium, non-crystalline state of matter that appears solid on a short time scale but continuously relaxes towards the liquid state. Let's break that down a bit further. Glass is a nonequilibrium material, which means the atomic structure is not in it's lowest energy, equilibrium configuration, which would be a liquid or crystal state. Consequently, all glasses have two options: to continuously relax toward the equilibrium liquid state or undergo a phase transition into the crystal state.This relaxation to the liquid state is so slow that from the human observation time, glasses appear solid. Glass being non-crystalline means the atomic structure lacks a long-range pattern, which adds additional complications when trying to predict how the atoms will arrange. And there are many other scientific \"non\" words we could include to more accurately define \"what is glass?\" We understand glass by what it is not, but we do not yet fully understand what glass is. This complication makes it thrilling to be in the field of glass science, as there is so much left to explore.Despite our lack of understanding of it, what are some of the ways the unique qualities of glass are being deployed in society today?Think about all the ways we interact with glass in our daily lives, in areas like information technology, where glass is fundamental to displays, augmented reality, memory storage, and optical data transfer. Then there are areas like transportation and architecture, with vehicles and construction materials, or the energy sector with photovoltaics and next-generation batteries. You can even look to health care with pharmaceutical packaging, antimicrobial surfaces, and prescription lenses. The impact of glass on our world has been tremendous.      What are you currently working on?Right now, I'm doing mostly experimental work trying to visualize the fluctuations in glass. By \"fluctuations\" I mean spatial fluctuations, how the properties vary in different regions of the glass, and I also mean temporal fluctuations, how the material changes over time.One of the most fascinating things about glass is that these fluctuations (i.e., deviations) in the atomic structure directly impact the macroscopic properties. When I come back to Penn State from my research fellowship at Hokkaido University to complete my Ph.D. with Dr. Mauro, I will be working with the data I'm collecting now to develop a computational framework to better understanding how fluctuations in thin film glasses could be manipulated to achieve new-found property behaviors.What would be some of the potential applications for what you're discovering?Fiber optics is a good one, because if we understand fluctuations in glass, we can better understand, predict, and optimize how an optical signal moves through a cable. When you consider the long distances these signals travel, we're talking about transoceanic communication, every small fluctuation has a big impact.Each time the light signal hits the silica walls of the cable, the local properties of the glass are going to influence how that signal propagates through the rest of fiber, which impacts the quality of the signal transfer and overall cost of the infrastructure. A deep understanding of how the impact of fluctuations in glass has major potential to improve fiber optic technology, and this is just one example of a potential application.What about the future? What new, future technology do you think will be facilitated by glass?That's the great part of this work. The possibilities are endless when we look toward applications of tomorrow for glass, such for the development and commercialization of non-lithium ion batteries, improved electronic memory storage devices, improved sustainable energy production, augmented reality interfaces, etc.The purpose of materials research is to better understand the fundamental sciences so we can develop the next groundbreaking technologies, and I have no doubt glass will play an integral role in that future.I remember as a kid my uncle, who was a metallurgist, showing me the images of the Hubble Space Telescope. He explained the engineering of the various materials used to facilitate the visualization of distant galaxies. Glass has allowed us to see beyond our own galaxy and explore the universe. It's thrilling to think about all the future discoveries that will be made thanks to glass. More information:Katelyn A.

  "text": "Colorful particles of plastic drift along under the surface of most waterways, from headwater streams to the Arctic Ocean. These barely visible microplastics\u2014less than 5 mm wide\u2014are potentially harmful to aquatic animals and plants, as well as humans. So, researchers are devising ways to remove them and to stop them at their source. Today, a team reports a two-stage device made with steel tubes and pulsing sound waves that removes most of the plastic particles from real water samples.          The researchers will present their results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.\"The idea came from a discussion with a colleague who said that we need new ways to collect microplastics from water,\" says Menake Piyasena, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator. \"Because acoustic forces can push particles together, I wondered if we could use them to aggregate microplastics in water, making the plastic easier to remove.\"Filtration is the most commonly used technique for removing these materials from water. For example, washing machine outlet filters can keep fibers that slough off clothes during washing from entering wastewater. But this method can be costly on a large scale, requiring regular cleaning of the filters, which can get clogged.Another option could be concentrating plastic particles in flowing water with acoustic forces, or sound waves, that transfer energy to nearby particles, causing some of them to vibrate and move. Just think of a speaker playing loud music that shakes the ground, bouncing flecks of dust and dirt toward each other. Scientists have already been using this phenomenon to separate biological particles from liquids, such as red blood cells from plasma.Recently, some teams have applied this approach to the separation of microplastics from samples they prepared in the lab with pure water. But this work was done with tiny volumes of water. They also used microplastics that were only tens of microns wide\u2014smaller than the width of human hair, explains Nelum Perera, a graduate student in Piyasena's lab at New Mexico Tech.\"I read that most of the microplastics in the environment are larger than that,\" says Perera, who is presenting the work. \"So, I wanted to develop a device that could be useful for most of the sizes and could be scaled up to meet real-world goals.\"To accommodate higher water flow rates, Perera created a proof-of-concept device with 8-mm-wide steel tubes connected to one inlet tube and multiple outlet tubes. Then she attached a transducer to the metal tube's side. When the transducer was turned on, it generated ultrasound waves across the metal tube, applying acoustic forces onto microplastics as they passed through the system, making them easier to capture. The prototype device is relatively simple compared to traditional filtration methods, Piyasena explains, because it doesn't clog as easily as a filter.      In initial experiments with polystyrene, polyethylene and polymethyl methacrylate microplastics, the researchers discovered that smaller (6- to 180-\u00b5m-wide) particles behaved differently than the larger (180- to 300-\u00b5m-wide) ones in the presence of acoustic forces. Spiked into pure water, particles of both sizes arranged along the center of the channel, exiting through the middle outlet, while clean water flowed out the surrounding outlets. But if laundry detergent or fabric softener were added to the water, the larger particles focused toward the sides, exiting through the side outlets, and purified water out the middle outlet.Based on these results, the researchers set out to develop a system that could take advantage of these differing movements. They connected two steel tubes in tandem: The first stage captured small microplastics less than 180 \u00b5m wide, and the water stream with the remaining larger microplastics went to the second stage to be cleaned. \"We removed more than 70% of the small plastics and more than 82% of the large ones this way,\" says Perera.To show that the two-stage system could work for real-world applications, Perera and Piyasena collected water from a pond on the New Mexico Tech campus and from the Rio Grande River. They filtered all of the samples to remove large contaminants, leaving behind water that still contained dissolved substances that could have affected the separation. Next, they spiked the water with microplastics. When the environmental water samples went through the acoustics device, plastic particles were removed as effectively as from pure water. With this prototype, Perera estimates it would cost around 7 cents to operate the current device for an hour and take around an hour and a half to clean one liter of water.The team's next step is to develop a system with wider tubes, or bundles of multiple tubes, and to try it on unspiked real-world samples, including ocean water and wastewater from washing machines. \"We have shown that acoustic forces can be used to concentrate a wide range of microplastic sizes,\" says Piyasena. \"And from here, we want to prove that this can be done on a larger scale with real samples that already have microplastics in them.\" More information:ACS Spring 2023: Removal of environmentally relevant microplastics using acoustic forces and steel tubes, www.acs.org/meetings/acs-meetings/spring-2023.htmlProvided byAmerican Chemical SocietyCitation:Pulsing ultrasound waves could someday remove microplastics from waterways (2023, March 28)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-03-pulsing-ultrasound-microplastics-waterways.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " origami",
  "text": "The ancient art of origami is well known for transforming sheets of paper and other foldable materials into complex 3D shapes. But now, chemical engineers have extended the centuries-old practice to produce intricate shapes made of glass or other hard materials. Their thoroughly modern method, which can be combined with 3D printing, could have applications ranging from sculpture to catalysis and beyond.          The researchers will present their results today at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330, and features more than 10,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.In earlier work, the researchers used origami and the related technique of kirigami\u2014which combines cutting with folding\u2014to shape soft materials made of polymers. \"But we wanted to extend these techniques to glass and ceramics, which are much harder to process into complex shapes than polymers,\" says Tao Xie, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator.Typically, glass and ceramics are shaped in a mold or are 3D printed in the desired final structure. But a mold can't produce a complicated shape, Xie says. And although 3D printing can do so, it's slow, and an object can be flimsy and need extra support while it's being made. In addition, the printed item usually has a layered texture that might not be the ideal appearance. The team set out to see if they could overcome these shortcomings.Yang Xu, a graduate student who works in Xie's lab at Zhejiang University, devised a technique in which she mixed nanoparticles of silica\u2014the main ingredient for making glass\u2014into a liquid containing several compounds. Curing the mixture with ultraviolet light produced a cross-linked polycaprolactone polymer with tiny beads of silica suspended in it, like raisins in raisin bread.Next, Xu cut, folded, twisted and pulled on sheets of this translucent polymer composite, which has mechanical properties similar to paper, to make a crane, a feather, a lacy vase and a sphere made of intertwined ribbons, among other objects. If she did this at room temperature, the composite retained its new shape fairly well throughout the remaining production steps. Xu discovered that's because the folding and stretching process irreversibly disrupts the interface between some of the silica particles and the polymer matrix. But if it's critical to fully retain the new shape during the subsequent steps, Xu found that the composite must be heated at about 265 F when it is folded and stretched. That permanently rearranges the links between the polymer chains, firmly fixing the new shape in place.      A subsequent heating step at more than 1,100 F removes the polycaprolactone polymer from the object and turns it opaque. After cooling, a third heating step, known as sintering, melts the silica particles together at temperatures topping 2,300 F to convert the object into clear glass with a smooth, non-layered texture. Achieving that full transparency turned out to be the project's biggest challenge. Including more polymer in the mix made the objects easier to fold but reduced their final transparency, explains Xu, who is presenting the work at the meeting. She ultimately found the right concentrations of polymer and silica to successfully compromise between those competing priorities.In her latest work, Xu is extending the method beyond glass to ceramics, replacing the silica with substances such as zirconium dioxide and titanium dioxide. Whereas glass is brittle and inert, these compounds open up the possibility of producing \"functional\" objects, such as materials that are less fragile than glass or that have catalytic properties.The group is also experimenting with a combination of kirigami and 3D printing to make even more complex shapes. \"When you fold a piece of paper, the level of complexity is somewhat limited, and 3D printing is kind of slow,\" Xie says. \"So we wanted to see if we could combine these two techniques to take advantage of their attractive attributes. That would give us the freedom to make almost any shaped part.\"In the catalyst field, Xie notes, people use 3D printing to make ceramic structures perforated with microscopic channels, which increase a catalyst's exposed surface area. Xu's method could enable more intricate designs for such applications, and as a test case, she has printed a pierced 3D lattice made of the silica-polymer composite (red structure in accompanying image).Xu notes that her process could be automated for large-scale manufacturing. She and Xie hope the ceramics and artistic communities will learn about the work and apply it in catalyst and sculpture design, as well as other purposes the researchers haven't even thought of yet.

ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.The symptoms of both flu and COVID-19 overlap considerably, making it difficult to distinguish between them, notes Deji Akinwande, Ph.D., who is presenting the work at the meeting.\"When both of these viruses are circulating together as they did earlier this winter, it would be immensely useful to have a sensor that can simultaneously detect whether you have COVID, flu, none of the above or both,\" he says.Akinwande, who is at The University of Texas at Austin, says that the device he and colleagues are developing could be modified to test for other infections as well.The group, including Dmitry Kireev, Ph.D., a postdoc in Akinwande's lab, constructed the COVID-19 and flu sensor using graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice pattern. Its extreme thinness renders graphene highly sensitive to any electrical changes in its environment. Akinwande and other researchers see enormous potential in using it and other, similar nanomaterials to create sensors for many different applications.\"These ultra-thin nanomaterials generally hold the record for best sensitivity, even down to the detection of single atoms, and they can improve the ability to detect very small quantities of basically anything that needs to be sensed, whether it's bacteria or viruses, in gas or in blood,\" Akinwande says.Previously, his group reported designing a graphene-based temporary tattoo that could monitor blood pressure. The tattoo consists of pairs of sensors placed along the arteries of the arm. One half of each pair sends out an electrical current that its partner detects. This signal is used to determine blood flow.To build the infection sensor, the researchers had to make graphene respond to the presence of viral protein. To do so, they looked to the immune system, which produces antibodies that are fine-tuned to recognize and latch onto particular pathogens. The researchers linked antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and against the flu virus to graphene. When a sample from an infected person is placed on the sensor, these antibodies bind to their target proteins, prompting a change in the electrical current.The researchers did not have the safety facilities needed to use whole, active flu or SARS-CoV-2 viruses to test the roughly square-inch sensor. To substitute, they used proteins from these viruses delivered in fluid intended to resemble saliva. Their results indicated that not only could the sensor detect the presence of the proteins, it could do so when they were present at extremely low quantities. This sensitivity suggested the sensor could be used for detecting the much more sparse viral particles found in breath, Akinwande says.The sensor also worked quickly, returning results within about 10 seconds of dropping in a sample, he says. By comparison, conventional COVID-19 tests can take minutes or hours, depending on the type, and a dual COVID and flu test recently authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration takes about half an hour to produce results.Akinwande and his group are working to improve its performance further, including by expanding the slate of viruses it can detect. With funding from the National Science Foundation, they are developing a sensor designed to test for SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as omicron and delta. While they are currently focusing on a two-variant design, the test could be adapted to simultaneously identify even more, they say.

  "text": "A new study has found that people who are currently suffering or face a high risk of post-traumatic stress disorder show particular patterns in four biomarkers that are measurable with a simple blood test. The findings suggest these biomarkers could be used to predict a person's likelihood of developing PTSD, diagnose the disorder or monitor the response to treatment.          PTSD can occur after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. It is currently diagnosed based on symptoms such as flashbacks, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, negative thoughts, memory problems and avoidance of triggering situations. Since other disorders can have some of these same symptoms, it can be challenging to diagnose PTSD and assess changes in response to treatment.This research, which involved over 1,000 service members, represents the largest prospective study to date to assess the biological markers of PTSD over time.\"This study provides valuable insights into the natural history of PTSD and the effectiveness of interventions, which can inform the development of treatment guidelines and improve the care for individuals suffering from PTSD,\" said Stacy-Ann Miller, a researcher at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. \"Better methods of predicting or screening for PTSD could help to overcome the disorder by identifying individuals at high risk of developing PTSD and providing them with early intervention or prevention strategies. This could potentially reduce the severity of symptoms or prevent the disorder from developing altogether.\"Miller will present the new research at Discover BMB, the annual meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, March 25\u201328 in Seattle.Biomarkers, which reflect biological processes, can provide an objective measure of physiological changes associated with diseases such as PTSD. For the study, researchers analyzed four biomarkers in blood samples from active-duty service members taken before a 10-month deployment, three days after their return and three to six months after their return. The biomarkers have previously been linked to stress, depression, anxiety and mental health disorders. They included: the glycolytic ratio, a measure of how the body breaks down sugar to produce energy; arginine, an amino acid that plays a role in the immune and cardiovascular systems; serotonin, a chemical messenger that helps regulate mood, sleep and other functions; and glutamate, a chemical messenger that plays a role in learning and memory.      The researchers divided service members into groups based on measures of PTSD and mental resilience and compared the four biomarkers among the different groups. Participants were classified as having PTSD, sub-threshold PTSD or no PTSD depending on their clinical diagnosis and PTSD symptoms. Researchers classified participants' resilience based on a combination of factors including PTSD, anxiety, sleep quality, alcohol use disorders, combat exposures, traumatic brain injury, and general physical and mental health. Previous studies have shown that people considered to have low resilience based on these measures are much more likely to develop PTSD after deployment than those with high resilience.Comparing these biomarkers in people with different PTSD status and levels of resilience, the results showed that those with PTSD or sub-threshold PTSD had significantly higher glycolytic ratio and lower arginine than those with high resilience. People with PTSD also had significantly lower serotonin and higher glutamate than those with high resilience. These associations were independent of factors such as gender, age, body mass index, smoking and caffeine consumption.The researchers said the biomarkers could help to predict which individuals face a high risk of PTSD, improve the accuracy of PTSD diagnosis and improve overall understanding of the drivers and effects of PTSD.\"Improved methods of screening and predicting PTSD could inform better treatment approaches by providing a deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of the disorder,\" said Miller. \"This could lead to the development of more targeted and effective treatments for PTSD or to identify specific subtypes of PTSD, which may respond differently to different treatments.\"Researchers cautioned that more research and validation would be needed to confirm the biomarkers' utility in real-world settings.The research was conducted in collaboration with the PTSD Systems Biology Consortium, a network of government and academic laboratories.

  "text": "Growing concerns over the potential health effects of exposure to phthalates, a component of many plastics and also known as a plasticizer, have led to a search for safer alternatives. In a new study conducted in cell cultures, researchers found that the chemical acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) might not be the best replacement because it appears to interfere with the growth and maintenance of neurons.          \"In the past, industries have promptly shifted away from the usage of toxic chemicals only to produce an equally toxic chemical, so this is something we are actively trying to avoid repeating,\" said Kyle Sease, a graduate student at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington. \"Our study suggests that ATBC, but not other non-phthalate alternatives, could interfere with cells that maintain brain health. We think this finding warrants further testing of ATBC at different doses, in different settings and in whole organism models.\"Sease will present the new research at Discover BMB, the annual meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, March 25\u201328 in Seattle.Phthalates are used in hundreds of products, often to enhance durability or allow materials to bend and stretch. Studies have shown that phthalate exposure can affect the reproductive system and early development in a range of animals, although the health impacts in humans are not clear. ATBC had emerged as a leading phthalate alternative as companies sought to shift away from phthalates; it is currently used in a variety of materials and products, including food and food packaging.For the study, researchers grew cultures of neuroblastoma cells, which in terms of growth and division, behave similarly to the glial cells that support and protect neurons in the brain. They then used molecular methods to study how ATBC and other chemicals affect genes and processes involved in cellular division. They found that neuroblastoma cells exposed to ATBC increased their expression of two genes associated with cellular stress (known as Nrf2 and p53) and also increased their production of an enzyme associated with cellular senescence (B-galactosidase), which can cause cells to stop growing and dividing.The findings suggest that ATBC could interfere with the ability for glial cells to regenerate, which can reduce their ability to protect neural cells and lead to neurodegeneration and accelerated aging. It is also possible that ATBC exposure during early development\u2014when neurons are actively growing and dividing\u2014could affect neurons directly and interfere with brain development, the researchers said. Since neurons do not typically regrow once damaged, any effects on the brain likely would be permanent.Two other phthalate alternatives, bis (2-ethylhexyl)-1, 4-benzenedicarboxylate (GPO) and dioctyl adipate (DOA), did not show the same effects as ATBC. \"We found that two other plasticizers did not appear to affect cell division in these cells, so further understanding the different effects of different plasticizers will allow us to understand better how to make safe ones,\" Sease said.

  "text": "Understanding the arrangement of electrons in compounds containing actinide elements, such as uranium and plutonium, can help advance the design of next-generation nuclear materials. These elements are challenging to study due to their complex chemistry and radioactivity. Additionally, these elements, which are in a sequence of related elements called the actinide series, have electrons that are organized in ways that don't match theoretical predictions.          Researchers have synthesized five different hybrid materials containing a particular compound subunit of plutonium and chlorine: the [PuCl6]2- anion. They probed the anion's electronic structure and found that while the electrons in the plutonium-chlorine bonds were mostly not shared (ionic), they also featured important contributions from covalent bonds where the electrons are shared. These covalent bonds correlated with the 5f shell of the quantum-mechanical model of the atom. This shell is also the region of mismatch between scientists' observations and theories of how electrons are organized around atomic nuclei.The research is published in the journal Inorganic Chemistry.Researchers synthesized five different hybrid materials, (4XPyH)2[PuCl6], where X= H, Cl, Br, I, and (4IPyH)4[PuCl6]\u00b72Cl, from an acidic, chloride-rich aqueous media. The team included researchers from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), George Washington University, the University of Sa\u0303o Paulo, and the State University of New York at Buffalo. The researchers then probed the electronic structure of the [PuCl6]2- anion by using the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and natural localized molecular orbital analysis. The researchers delineated the underlying bond mechanism and hybrid atomic orbital contributions within the plutonium-ligand bonds. The research team also evaluated two related compounds that they had reported in previous papers. The researchers subjected materials containing the [PuO2Cl4]2- and [PuCl3(H2O)5] molecular units, to the same level of analysis to establish trends in bonding.The results revealed the Pu-Cl bonds were predominantly ionic, yet featured important covalent contributions that increased as bond polarity decreased from [PuCl3(H2O)5] < [PuO2Cl4]2- < [PuCl6]2-. Similarly, the Pu-based hybrid atomic orbitals in the Pu-Cl bonds exhibited decreased s and d orbital character, while the f orbital contribution increased. However, the Cl-based hybrid atomic orbitals did not vary significantly. This indicates that the 5f shell contributes to the covalent character of the Pu-Cl bond. This level of analysis provided valuable insight into the role of oxidation state, coordination geometry, and metal-ion charge in plutonium-ligand bond analysis.The results of this study help scientists understand and predict the chemical and physical behavior of transuranic elements\u2014elements beyond uranium in the periodic table. This is an important step toward advancing the design of next-generation nuclear materials. It could also help more effectively manage nuclear waste. By gaining new information on the role of the 5f shell in plutonium-chlorine bonds, this research contributes to the collective goal of resolving the f-electron challenge. Resolving this is the overarching goal of the Department of Energy Office of Science's Heavy Element Chemistry program. More information:Robert G.

  "text": "As new environmental regulations are rolling out to mitigate the industry-retired long-chain chemicals known as PFAS in drinking water, there are concerns regarding a new breed of \"forever chemicals\" called short-chain PFAS. Research from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is helping shift the focus to include mitigation of the chemicals\u2014which researchers say are just as persistent as, more mobile and harder to remove from the environment than their long-chain counterparts.          A study directed by chemical and biomolecular engineering professor Xiao Su uses electrosorption rather than filters and solvents and combines synthesis, separations testing and computer simulations to help design an electrode that can attract and capture a range of short-chain PFAS from environmental waters. The findings are published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\"One of the challenges of working with short-chain PFAS is that they are not well-studied. We know that they contain fewer carbon and fluorine atoms, making them shorter molecules and, therefore, more mobile\u2014or freer to interact within the natural environment,\" said Su, who collaborated with chemical and biomolecular engineering professor Diwakar Shukla. \"Their electrostatic properties differ and they are more hydrophilic, meaning they are more apt to bond with water molecules. These properties combined make them more difficult to separate from water than their long-chained counterparts.\"The differences among short- and long-chain PFAS\u2014and between long-chain PFAS in general\u2014are significant enough for Su's team to rethink its previously-developed electrode designed to attract, capture and destroy long-chain PFAS from the environment and drinking water sources. PFAS is an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.\"One way to think of the behavior of short-chain PFAS is that they don't like to be around anything except their own kind,\" Su said. \"So, to attract them, we need to sort of bait them with grafted fluorine groups\u2014the \"F' in PFAS\u2014on the surface of an electrode.\"Kinship is not the only challenge, though, Su said.\"The lengths of short-chain PFAS molecules vary, giving them different physical properties,\" Su said. \"This means we need to be able to tune the electrode just right to attract and eventually release the short-chain PFAS, with molecular-level understanding of the interactions being key to success.\"The study details the careful selection, matching and triangulating of different copolymer materials to develop an electrode that can attract a range of short-chain PFAS and induce an electric field to help release the molecules when needed.Su said this work is a critical early step in removing short-chain PFAS from the environment, which have replaced long-chain PFAS in many industries.\"We still have much work to do,\" Su said. \"Future studies will focus on coupling the electrodes developed in this study with electrochemical degradation methods to ensure removal of these persistent contaminants from the environment.\"Illinois researchers Anaira Rom\u00e1n Santiago, Jiho Lee and Johannes Elbert led the experimental investigations within the work, with graduate student Song Yin and Shukla leading the computational simulations.

  "text": "Rapid pregnancy and COVID-19 tests have a great advantage over other medical analyses: they are so simple that anyone can perform the test themselves, virtually anywhere. This is due to the robust principle behind these microfluidic methods, whereby aqueous solutions diffuse through a paper test strip with the aid of capillary forces. During this process, antibodies capture the target substances, such as virus particles or pregnancy hormones, and concentrate them at a desired location. A staining system then slowly makes the increasingly concentrated target substance visible as a stripe.          As simple and reliable as this basic principle is, visual assessment of the results can be difficult. The question of whether we really can see a line or whether we're just imagining it has probably been on all of our minds at least once since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.This is exactly where the invention of the ETH team comes in. They have found a way to form conductive electrodes directly inside the test strip paper. As the target substance is captured, it triggers an electronic signal. This makes measurements much faster, more sensitive and more accurate.Making low-cost paper technology betterChih-Jen Shih and Andrew deMello share a passion: \"Our biggest incentive is to improve basic chemical and biological experiments in ways that create new scientific opportunities.\" This is exactly what their research groups have now succeeded in doing with the rapid tests.A host of analytical applications benefit from the researchers' combining simple and cost-effective paper-based microfluidics with the sensitivity and accuracy of electronic measurement techniques. From patients being able to monitor blood biomarkers themselves, to soil, air and water sampling in the field, to disease testing in remote parts of the world in a matter of minutes\u2014the potential range of applications covers virtually all chemical, biological and medical analyses that can be performed in aqueous solutions.A combination of skills is the keyPrevious attempts to equip low-cost paper chemistry with detection electrodes have been hampered by a fundamental property of conductive materials: in principle, electrical conductors hardly interact with water and act as a barrier when it comes to the flow of sample and reaction mixtures in a paper strip.Overcoming this hurdle and developing the technology into a reliable process that also works in less developed areas of the world called for a combination of skills, deMello says. For the new rapid test, the ETH researchers therefore pooled their expertise. From Shih's group came the know-how to generate conductivity directly in the paper, while deMello's group brought their knowledge of microfluidic systems to the table.      A laser decomposes cellulose to pure carbonThe basis for this invention is the use of a laser to convert the sugar polymers that make up the cellulose in the paper into graphene. This special form of carbon is conductive and is considered an electronic material of the future.During laser conversion, the cellulose molecules are decomposed into their elements, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, in a process comparable to the caramelization of household sugar. However, while heating sugar in a pan for a long time leaves behind only ordinary carbon, which does not conduct electric current, the ETH Zurich scientists were able to use the laser to reorganize the carbon atoms of the cellulose into conductive graphene.Clever tuning of the laser energy makes the differenceProducing graphene in cellulose paper alone wouldn't do the trick, though, because\u2014like virtually all other conductive materials\u2014this miracle material is hydrophobic: it repels water, which means water cannot simply flow through it. However, by cleverly tuning the laser energy, the researchers can control the decomposition of the cellulose to graphene such that not only is the original porosity of the cellulose preserved, but individual oxygen groups of the cellulose remain intact on the surface of the graphene areas.These oxygen groups can interact with water molecules and thus ensure wettability in the electrodes, practically on a par with the rest of the paper. What's more, reporter molecules can also be chemically bound to these oxygen groups. In this way, an electronic signal is generated as soon as a virus particle interacts with a detection antibody on the electrode.Developing the science into a practical productThe researchers tuned the laser energy in two main ways: They treated the paper with flame retardants to prevent the laser energy from completely charring or even burning the cellulose. In addition, they reduced the laser power and instead used multiple pulses, which put less energy per unit area into the paper.However, Shih and deMello didn't content themselves with scientifically proving the principle of paper electrodes. Rather, their aspiration was to develop a product that could be used in practice. To this end, they implemented the principle in practical applications and massively simplified the production of the analytical paper strips. It already takes just 90 minutes to produce 176 sensors from one A4 sheet of paper\u2014at a unit cost of only 0.02 dollars.An ideal environment for interdisciplinary innovationsFor Shih, the environment at ETH Zurich played a decisive role in the invention: \"We're part of the Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences. As engineers, we're directly inspired by the cutting-edge research being done all around us.\"How the two chemical engineers will make their invention available to society and market it has yet to be determined. Given the enormously wide range of possible applications, a licensing model might make sense. But in this regard, too, the scientists can rely on the environment at ETH Zurich. deMello says, \"The people at ETH transfer have a lot of experience in protecting intellectual property and negotiating licensing agreements.\"Regardless of how the invention will find its way into concrete products, the bottom line is that countless people around the world are likely to benefit from this ETH innovation. From more effective medical therapies to more efficient agriculture and seamless infection monitoring\u2014embedding electrodes directly into the test strips takes the capabilities of paper fluidics to a new level.

  "text": "A team at UT Southwestern has developed a computational approach to uncover mechanisms of protein misfolding linked to neurodegenerative diseases. The study, published in Nature Communications, offers key insights that could help identify new treatments for patients.          The study analyzed structures of amyloid fibrils, which are made up of proteins that are normally soluble but have assembled in a way that makes them insoluble and often dangerous. Many types of amyloids are associated with different neurodegenerative diseases.\"Understanding the mechanisms of amyloid folding will help identify novel methods to treat protein misfolding diseases,\" said Lukasz Joachimiak, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Biochemistry and in the Center for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UTSW's Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute. Dr. Joachimiak is an Effie Marie Cain Scholar in Medical Research and the lead author of the study.According to Dr. Joachimiak, tau proteins play key roles in healthy brain cells. However, when a tau protein misfolds in a way that exposes certain motifs that allow it to self-replicate and build on itself, it wreaks havoc in the brain. This assembly of proteins creates distinct shapes of aggregated tau proteins that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases known as \"tauopathies.\" The study looked at conformations from diseases classified as tauopathies, including Alzheimer's and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.Using tau as a model protein, the computational approach developed by the researchers allowed them to estimate the energetics of interactions in structures of amyloid fibrils. By applying this to 27 distinct tau protein structures, they uncovered networks of interactions involved in stabilizing different amyloid fibril folds.This information was used to classify different tauopathies based on fibril structure conformation, opening the door to design tau sequences that only adopt a single conformation. The study is believed to be the first to computationally model the effect that mutations have on fibril structure stability\u2014an insight that will be essential in developing methods to predict these structures from the protein sequence alone.\"We are applying these methods to control folding of other amyloid-forming proteins that direct normal biological processes to begin to manipulate them,\" Dr. Joachimiak said.The study links the team's previous work that focused on the process of misfolding in an individual tau molecule with end-stage amyloid fibril conformations observed after onset of the disease.

  "text": "In addition to an antigen, many vaccines also contain substances, called adjuvants, which stimulate the immune system. By using computer-aided molecular design and machine learning, a Chinese research team has now developed two novel broad-spectrum adjuvants that can significantly amplify the immune response to vaccines. As reported in the journal Angewandte Chemie, they were able to enhance the effectiveness of immunization against certain forms of cancer in animal models.          Adjuvants amplify and prolong the effect of vaccine immunizations. Aluminum salts have been successfully used as adjuvants for many decades. Alternatively, there are oil-in-water emulsions that target pattern recognition receptors on immune cells. However, older versions of this type of adjuvant were not effective enough or had troublesome side effects. Newer versions are well-tolerated and effective but need to be tailored for every individual vaccine.By using computer-aided molecular design and machine learning, Bing Yan, Sijin Liu, and their team at the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences and the Capital Medical University in Beijing, as well as the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and Hangzhou, the Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, and the Guangzhou University, have now developed two novel adjuvants with broad-spectrum effectiveness that can significantly boost the immune response to vaccines.The new adjuvants are designed to bind to toll-like receptors (TLR), a class of proteins used by dendritic cells to detect the characteristic molecular patterns of pathogens. If an \"enemy\" is recognized, the dendritic cell moves into a lymph node and \"presents\" its find to the T-cells. These activated T-cells then multiply and enlist further immune cells in the fight.The team identified structural characteristics of the binding sites on human TLR and developed a collection, a substance library, with 46 different ligands that are compatible with the binding site. The special twist in this case is that these ligands are anchored to the surfaces of biocompatible gold nanoparticles.This causes them to be bound more easily by the TLR. Two of the ligands were found to be especially effective. Comprehensive in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies demonstrated that they bind to several different TLR and increase the activation of dendritic cells, presentation of antigens to T-cells, and their activation.Mice treated with tumor-specific antigens plus one of these new adjuvants demonstrated strong immune responses that suppressed tumor growth and lung metastases after implantation of specific cancer cells.Adjuvants further optimized through this method could reduce the problem of decreasing immunity for current vaccines and perhaps make booster vaccines unnecessary. Their use in immunotherapy to treat cancer is also highly promising.

  "text": "Near-infrared light, whose wavelength is longer than visible light, is invisible and can pass through many substances. Organic materials that efficiently absorb near-infrared light are essential for technological innovations that utilize near-infrared light, such as the dyes in the infrared blocking filters of smartphone cameras and security inks. These and many more technical applications make developing new dyes that can absorb longer wavelengths of near-infrared light desirable.       Previously, near-infrared absorbing organic materials were treated as closed-shell molecules without unpaired electrons. However, a joint research group led by Associate Professor Takeshi Maeda, Assistant Professor Daisuke Sakamaki, and Professor Hideki Fujiwara from Osaka Metropolitan University discovered that near-infrared absorbing oxocarbon-based dyes have an intermediate state between closed-shell and open-shell electronic configurations. They also found that as the wavelengths of near-infrared light absorbed increase, so does the contribution of open-shell forms in the dye.Their research results were published in Chemical Science on January 16, 2023.\"We have clarified the proper electronic structure of near-infrared absorbing oxocarbon-based dyes that are regarded as pure closed-shell molecules. We hope that this will lead to advances in the molecular design, properties, functions, and applications of near-infrared absorbing dyes and to the development of new near-infrared absorbing organic materials that be used in society,\" Professor Takeshi Maeda said.

  "answer_squad": " elesclomol",
  "text": "A new study has uncovered a unique way in which the anti-cancer drug elesclomol enables copper delivery in cells, aiding in the search for treatments for copper deficiency disorders such as Menkes disease.          Menkes disease is an extremely rare hereditary copper-deficiency disorder in infants. It is characterized by progressive neurological injury culminating in death, typically by the age of three.A Texas A&M AgriLife Research team led by Vishal Gohil, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics in Texas A&M's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Bryan-College Station, first discovered the therapeutic potential of elesclomol for treating copper deficiency disorders. Additionally, previous research by Gohil's team showed that elesclomol could be used effectively in a mouse model to treat Menkes disease.The new study, \"FDX1-dependent and independent mechanisms of elesclomol-mediated intracellular copper delivery,\" was recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed journal of the National Academy of Sciences. The research was led by Gohil, with Mohammed Zulkifli, Ph.D., a research scientist in the same department, as the first author of the study.The study was conducted in collaboration with scientists from the University of Houston, Oregon Health and Science University, University of Missouri and the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy multidisciplinary science and engineering research center.Elesclomol and copper deficiency Genetic defects in copper transport to copper-containing enzymes, referred to as \"cuproenzymes,\" result in fatal disorders such as Menkes disease. No effective treatment is currently available for these copper deficiency disorders.\"To realize the full potential of elesclomol, it was necessary to gain a mechanistic understanding of how this drug makes copper available to different cellular cuproenzymes,\" Gohil said. \"We needed to look at the mechanism by which copper brought into cells by elesclomol is released and delivered to cuproenzymes present in different subcellular compartments.\"He said the study used a combination of biochemistry, cell biology and genetics to demonstrate that the release of copper from elesclomol occurs both inside and outside mitochondria.

Credit: Texas A&M AgriLife photo by Michael Miller             Copper and human health Copper is an essential trace element required for the activity and stability of several cuproenzymes involved in a wide array of physiological processes.\"Copper is an essential micronutrient, and genetic mutations that prevent copper transport across cellular membranes or its delivery to cuproenzymes can result in lethal human disorders such as Menkes disease,\" Gohil said.Currently, no Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies are available for treating Menkes disease. Additionally, direct administration of hydrophilic copper salts has shown limited efficacy in clinical trials.\"We hypothesized that this limited efficacy was likely due to inefficient copper delivery across cellular membranes, so there was an unmet need to identify compounds that can safely and effectively transport copper across biological membranes and restore cellular copper balance,\" Gohil said.The study Previous research had shown that ferredoxin 1, FDX1, a mitochondrial enzyme, was the protein target of elesclomol. In the current study, Gohil and his team showed that FDX1 releases copper bound to elesclomol by reducing it to a form of copper cells can use. The study also showed that even when FDX1 was absent, elesclomol could still bring some copper into cells in other unknown ways.Zulkifli said FDX1 can also help release copper from other clinically used copper-transporting drugs, but compared with elesclomol, these drugs are much less dependent on FDX1 to make the copper bioavailable to cuproenzymes.\"These modes of copper release by elesclomol are distinct from those of other currently used copper-transporting drugs,\" Zulkifli said. \"This may explain the high potency of elesclomol in rectifying copper deficiency.\"Building on past researchPrevious studies by Gohil and his team have highlighted the therapeutic potential of elesclomol in treating diseases of copper deficiency. Some of this previous research also showed that elesclomol can restore the levels of cytochrome c oxidase protein complex, a critical copper-dependent enzyme required for mitochondrial energy production.The Gohil lab also demonstrated that elesclomol improves copper deficiency in yeast, zebrafish and mouse models by delivering copper to mitochondria and restoring the function of the cytochrome c oxidase.Additionally, the use of elesclomol to treat copper deficiency disorders is at the center of a licensing agreement between The Texas A&M University System, managed through the Intellectual Property and Commercialization office of Texas A&M AgriLife Research, and California-based Engrail Therapeutics.

  "text": "For a long time it has been suspected that fullerene and its derivatives could form naturally in the universe. These are large carbon molecules shaped like a football, salad bowl or nanotube. An international team of researchers using the Swiss SLS synchrotron light source at PSI has shown how this reaction works. The results have just been published in the journal Nature Communications.          \"We are stardust, we are golden. We are billion-year-old carbon.\" In the song they performed at Woodstock, the US group Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young summarized what humans are essentially made of: star dust. Anyone with a little knowledge of astronomy can confirm the words of the cult American band\u2014both the planets and we humans are actually made up of dust from burnt-out supernovae and carbon compounds billions of years old. The universe is a giant reactor and understanding these reactions means understanding the origins and development of the universe\u2014and where humans come from.In the past, the formation of fullerenes and their derivatives in the universe has been a puzzle. These carbon molecules, in the shape of a football, bowl or small tube, were first created in the laboratory in the 1980s. In 2010 the infrared space telescope Spitzer discovered the C60 molecules with the characteristic shape of a soccer ball, known as buckyballs, in the planetary nebula Tc 1. They are therefore the biggest molecules to have been discovered to date known to exist in the universe beyond our solar system.But how do they actually form there? A team of researchers from Honolulu (U.S.), Miami (U.S.) and Tianjin (China) has now completed an important reaction step in the formation of the molecules, with active support from PSI and the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) beamline of the synchrotron light source Swiss SLS. \"PSI offers unique experimental facilities and that's why we decided to collaborate with Patrick Hemberger at PSI,\" says Ralf Kaiser from the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, the leading international researcher in this field.

The smallest nanobowl, corannulene, as well as the C40 nanobowl [2] emphasized as a molecular building block of Buckminsterfullerene (C60), rugbyballene (C70), and end-capped (5,5) armchair nanotubes.

DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-37058-y             A mini reactor for fullerenePatrick Hemberger, a scientist working on the VUV beamline at PSI, has built a mini reactor for observing the formation of fullerene in real time. A corannulene radical (C20H9) is created in a reactor at a temperature of 1,000 degrees Celsius. This molecule looks like a salad bowl, as if it had been dissected from a C60 buckyball. This radical is highly reactive. It reacts with vinyl acetylene (C4H4), which deposits a layer of carbon onto the rim of the bowl.\"By repeating this process many times, the molecule would grow into the end cap of a nanotube. We have managed to demonstrate this phenomenon in computer simulations,\" explains Alexander Mebel, Professor of Chemistry at Florida International University and one of the authors of the study. But that was not the researchers' only goal: \"We wanted to show that this type of reaction is physically possible,\" Ralf Kaiser adds.The reaction produces different isomers\u2014molecules that all have the same mass, but slightly different structures. With standard mass spectrometry, all these variants produce the same signal. But the outcome is different when using photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy, the method adopted by the team. \"With this technique, the structure of the measurement curve allows conclusions to be drawn about each individual isomer,\" Patrick Hemberger explains.      Solving the puzzle of classic football-shaped molecules\"The universe contains a wild jungle of molecules and chemical reactions\u2014not all of them can be distinctly classified in the signals from telescopes,\" says Ralf Kaiser. We already know from models that both corannulene and vinylacetylene exist in the universe. Now it has been possible to confirm that these molecules actually form the building blocks to fullerene. \"That's why the experiment at PSI is so valuable for us.\"But the successful publication in Nature Communications is not the end of the story. The researchers want to conduct more experiments in order to understand how the classic buckyballs form in the universe, along with the football-shaped fullerene molecules with 60 carbon atoms and the minute nanotubes with even more atoms.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the squid that is masters of camouflage?",
  "answer_squad": " octopuses",
  "text": "Squids and octopuses are masters of camouflage, blending into their environment to evade predators or surprise prey. Some aspects of how these cephalopods become reversibly transparent are still \"unclear,\" largely because researchers can't culture cephalopod skin cells in the lab. Today, however, researchers report that they have replicated the tunable transparency of some squid skin cells in mammalian cells, which can be cultured. The work could not only shed light on basic squid biology, but also lead to better ways to image many cell types.          The researchers will present their results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.For many years, Alon Gorodetsky, Ph.D., and his research group have been working on materials inspired by squid. In past work, they developed \"invisibility stickers,\" which consisted of bacterially produced squid reflectin proteins that were adhered onto sticky tape. \"So then, we had this crazy idea to see whether we could capture some aspect of the ability of squid skin tissues to change transparency within human cell cultures,\" says Gorodetsky, who is the principal investigator on the project.The team at the University of California, Irvine focused their efforts on cephalopod cells called leucophores, which have particulate-like nanostructures composed of reflectin proteins that scatter light. Typically, reflectins clump together and form the nanoparticles, so light isn't absorbed or directly transmitted; instead, the light scatters or bounces off of them, making the leucophores appear bright white.\"We wanted to engineer mammalian cells to stably, instead of temporarily, form reflectin nanostructures for which we could better control the scattering of light,\" says Gorodetsky. That's because if cells allow light through with little scattering, they'll seem more transparent. Alternatively, by scattering a lot more light, cells will become opaque and more apparent. \"Then, at a cellular level, or even the culture level, we thought that we could predictably alter the cells' transparency relative to the surroundings or background,\" he says.To change how light interacts with cultured cells, Georgii Bogdanov, a graduate student in Gorodetsky's lab who is presenting the results, introduced squid-derived genes that encoded for reflectin into human cells, which then used the DNA to produce the protein. \"A key advance in our experiments was getting the cells to stably produce reflectin and form light-scattering nanostructures with relatively high refractive indices, which also allowed us to better image the cells in three dimensions,\" says Bogdanov.      In experiments, the team added salt to the cells' culture media and observed the reflectin proteins clumping together into nanostructures. By systematically increasing the salt concentration, Bogdanov got detailed, time-lapse 3D images of the nanostructures' properties. As the nanoparticles became larger, the amount of light that bounced off the cells increased, consequently tuning their opacity.Then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, leaving the researchers to wonder what they could do to advance their investigation without being physically in the lab. So, Bogdanov spent his time at home developing computational models that could predict a cell's expected light scattering and transparency before an experiment was even run. \"It's a beautiful loop between theory and experiments, where you feed in design parameters for the reflectin nanostructures, get out specific predicted optical properties and then engineer the cells more efficiently\u2014for whatever light-scattering properties you might be interested in,\" explains Gorodetsky.On a basic level, Gorodetsky suggests that these results will help scientists better understand squid skin cells, which haven't been successfully cultured in a laboratory setting. For example, previous researchers postulated that reflectin nanoparticles disassemble and reassemble to change the transparency of tunable squid leucophores. And now Gorodetsky's team has shown that similar rearrangements occurred in their stable engineered mammalian cells with simple changes in salt concentration, a mechanism that appears analogous to what has been observed in the tunable squid cells.The researchers are now optimizing their technique to design better cellular imaging strategies based on the cells' intrinsic optical properties. Gorodetsky envisions that the reflectin proteins could act as genetically encoded tags that would not bleach inside human cells. \"Reflectin as a molecular probe provides a lot of possibilities to track structures in cells with advanced microscopy techniques,\" adds Bogdanov. For example, the scientists propose that imaging approaches based on their work could also have implications for better understanding cell growth and development.

  "text": "Nobody likes needles, but they're necessary for delivering many vaccines and biologics into the body. But what if those could be puffed through the skin instead, with just a little pressure, like being hit in the arm with a foam toy? Today, scientists report steps toward making that a reality. Using powdered vaccines that don't require refrigeration and a system driven by compressed gas, their \"MOF-Jet\" could easily deliver therapeutics against cancer and other diseases in a relatively painless way.          The researchers will present their results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.The idea for the project was formed out of pandemic-induced boredom. The project's principal investigator, Jeremiah Gassensmith, Ph.D., had ordered inexpensive pieces of a compressed gas-powered jet injection system to mess around with while stuck at home. Later, after everyone was back on campus, he handed the pieces over to Yalini Wijesundara, a graduate student in the lab, with the instructions, \"See what you can do with this.\"Wijesundara, who is presenting the work at the meeting, took these instructions in stride. She had previously researched other jet injectors dating back to the 1960s that use compressed gas to inject a narrow stream of fluid. If the injectors could be modified to fire solids, she figured, they could deliver cargo encased in metal-organic frameworks, or MOFs, as well. These frameworks are porous, crystalline structures that act like molecular \"cages\" to encapsulate a wide variety of materials, including nucleic acids and proteins. By combining the jet injector with the lab's existing work on MOFs, Wijesundara created a \"MOF-Jet.\" The jet can deliver powders to cells by, quite literally, shooting them in with air. Both Gassensmith and Wijesundara are at The University of Texas at Dallas.Jet injectors previously saw widespread use in the military, but they were painful and the fluid often splashed back, potentially spreading other diseases such as Hepatitis B. A modern-day descendant is the \"gene gun,\" which is typically used in veterinary medicine and can cost tens of thousands of dollars. These devices also shoot biological cargo into cells. In this case, the cargo is attached to the surface of a metal microparticle, typically made of gold or tungsten. But once it penetrates the skin, the metal particles remain there and can speed up the degradation of the biological material.      A different strategy would be to put the cargo inside a MOF. Gassensmith's group previously worked with the MOF called zeolitic-imidazolate framework eight, or ZIF-8. \"Compared to gold, it's cheap and protects biological materials, such as nucleic acids,\" explains Wijesundara. \"We can also store vaccine formulations within it as powders at room temperature, which eliminates the need for the extremely cold temperatures many liquid vaccines require.\"The team encased a variety of biological materials within ZIF-8, which protected them from being broken down too quickly. To deliver the materials into cells, the team used their own modified, gene gun-inspired \"MOF-Jet.\" Wijesundara created \"bullets\" for the device, each loaded with a dose of functionalized ZIF-8, and a puff of gas fired the powdered formulation into cells, which was as easy as just \"pointing and shooting.\" They tested their system and showed that the MOF-Jet delivered a ZIF-8-encased gene to onion cells and a ZIF-8-encased protein to mice. According to Gassensmith, the blast from the injector just feels \"like you got hit with a Nerf bullet\"\u2014much less painful than being stuck with a needle.By tinkering with the MOF-Jet, Wijesundara soon realized that cargo release could be tuned by simply changing the injector's carrier gas. ZIF-8 is sensitive to acidic environments, and when carbon dioxide reacts with water in cells, it makes carbonic acid that, in turn, helps break apart the MOF. \"If you shoot it with carbon dioxide, it will release its cargo faster within cells; if you use regular air, it will take four or five days,\" she explains. This means that the same drug could be released over different timescales without changing its formulation. \"Once we realized that, it opened up a lot of possibilities,\" says Gassensmith.The team is now using this method to deliver chemotherapeutics and adjuvants as a potential treatment for melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. They say that because the MOF-Jet can disperse material over a wide area, it could distribute a cancer therapeutic into a melanoma more evenly than with a needle, which is the current delivery method. And simply by controlling the carrier gas, they could deliver chemotherapeutics with a fast- or slow-release timeframe, depending on a patient's needs. Though research is still ongoing, preliminary experiments are yielding promising results. Wijesundara and Gassensmith say that the adaptability of their MOF-Jet could allow a wide number of applications, from veterinary medicine to agriculture, or someday even human vaccinations or treatments.

  "answer_squad": " ACS Spring 2023",
  "text": "In chemistry, we have He, Fe and Ca\u2014but what about do, re and mi? Hauntingly beautiful melodies aren't the first things that come to mind when looking at the periodic table of the elements. However, using a technique called data sonification, a recent college graduate has converted the visible light given off by the elements into audio, creating unique, complex sounds for each one. Today, the researcher reports the first step toward an interactive, musical periodic table.          The researcher will present his results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.Previously, W. Walker Smith, the project's sole investigator, took his combined passions of music and chemistry and converted the natural vibrations of molecules into a musical composition. \"Then I saw visual representations of the discrete wavelengths of light released by the elements, such as scandium,\" says Smith. \"They were gorgeous and complex, and I thought, 'Wow, I really want to turn these into music, too.'\"Elements emit visible light when they are energized. This light is made up of multiple individual wavelengths, or particular colors, with brightness levels that are unique for each element. But on paper, the collections of wavelengths for different elements are hard to tell apart visually, especially for the transition metals, which can have thousands of individual colors, says Smith. Converting the light into sound frequencies could be another way for people to detect the differences between elements.However, creating sounds for the elements on the periodic table has been done before. For instance, other scientists have assigned the brightest wavelengths to single notes played by the keys on a traditional piano. But this approach reduced the rich variety of wavelengths released by some elements into just a few sounds, explains Smith, who is currently a researcher at Indiana University.To retain as much of the complexity and nuance of the element spectra as possible, Smith consulted faculty mentors at Indiana University, including David Clemmer, Ph.D., a professor in the chemistry department, and Chi Wang, D.M.A., a professor in the Jacobs School of Music. With their assistance, Smith built a computer code for real-time audio that converted each element's light data into mixtures of notes. The discrete color wavelengths became individual sine waves whose frequency corresponded to that of the light, and their amplitude matched the brightness of the light.      Early in the research process, Clemmer and Smith discussed the pattern similarities between light and sound vibrations. For instance, within the colors of visible light, violet has almost double the frequency of red, and in music, one doubling of frequency corresponds to an octave. Therefore, visible light can be thought of as an \"octave of light.\" But this octave of light is at a much higher frequency than the audible range. So, Smith scaled the sine waves' frequencies down by approximately 10-12, fitting the audio output into a range where human ears are most sensitive to differences in pitch.Because some elements had hundreds or thousands of frequencies, the code allowed these notes to be generated in real time, forming harmonies and beating patterns as they mixed together. \"The result is that the simpler elements, such as hydrogen and helium, sound vaguely like musical chords, but the rest have a more complex collection of sounds,\" says Smith. For example, calcium sounds like bells chiming together with a rhythm resulting from how the frequencies interact with each other. Listening to the notes from some other elements reminded Smith of a spooky background noise, similar to music used in cheesy horror movies. He was especially surprised by the element zinc, which despite having a large number of colors, sounded like \"an angelic choir singing a major chord with vibrato.\"\"Some of the notes sound out of tune, but Smith has kept true to that in this translation of the elements into music,\" says Clemmer. These off-key tones\u2014known musically as microtones\u2014come from frequencies that are found between the keys of a traditional piano. Agreeing, Wang says, \"The decisions as to what's vital to preserve when doing data sonification are both challenging and rewarding. And Smith did a great job making such decisions from a musical standpoint.\"The next step is to turn this technology into a new musical instrument with an exhibit at the WonderLab Museum of Science, Health, and Technology in Bloomington, Indiana. \"I want to create an interactive, real-time musical periodic table, which allows both children and adults to select an element and see a display of its visible light spectrum and hear it at the same time,\" says Smith. He adds that this sound-based approach has potential value as an alternative teaching method in chemistry classrooms, because it's inclusive to people with visual impairments and different learning styles.On Tuesday, March 28, at 3:00 p.m., during the ACS Spring 2023 Meeting, Smith will also perform \"The Sound of Molecules,\" a show that will feature audio clips of a few of the elements, as well as \"compositions\" of larger molecules.

  "text": "Black women and others with curly or kinky hair encounter a vast and confusing array of haircare options. Advice on the best products to use for a certain type of hair is often contradictory, and the results can be highly variable. Now, scientists are bringing order to this chaos by identifying properties such as the number of curls or coils in a given length of hair that could eventually help users pick the perfect product and achieve consistent results.          The researchers will present their findings today at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2023 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person March 26\u201330.\"As an African American, I was born with very curly, seemingly unmanageable hair, and other ethnicities can possess similar hair properties,\" says Michelle Gaines, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator. Gaines used to rely on chemical relaxers to straighten her tresses but stopped when she became pregnant. She was then confronted with an overwhelming variety of products available to style and care for natural hair. Limited guidance about the best options for her particular hair type, and conflicting advice from friends, YouTube videos and other resources, didn't help the situation.Clearly, Gaines says, there is a major knowledge gap that needs to be closed, so she has set out to fill it. \"As a polymer chemist and materials scientist, I thought it would be great to start a project where I could study the nuances of my hair, because I felt like it wasn't very well understood,\" she says.Most prior research on properties was done on wavy or straight strands from white or Asian people, according to Gaines, who is at Spelman College, a historically Black college for women. Less is known about what has traditionally been called \"African\" hair, she says, though researchers at Groote Schuur Hospital and the University of Cape Town in South Africa have published some findings.L'Or\u00e9al, as well as celebrity hair stylist Andre Walker and others, have developed systems to classify different types of hair. Walker's system ranges from straight to kinky, a category including tight coils and zig-zag strands with angular bends. Although some people believe all of these classification methods convey a preference for a smoother and straighter appearance\u2014a bias with historic links to the preferential treatment of enslaved people who had straighter hair and lighter skin\u2014they're intended to help users choose the most suitable haircare products. Gaines felt these systems worked well for straight and wavy hair but lacked the nuance to distinguish the many varieties of curly and kinky hair.      Gaines wanted to see if she could identify differences in properties other than curl shape and tightness, and then use those differences to develop a more precise and quantitative classification system. Undergraduates at Spelman eagerly lined up to help. Gaines and her student, Imani Page, are collaborating with Alfred Crosby, Ph.D., and Gregory Grason, Ph.D., at the University of Massachusetts Amherst; their expertise includes material property characterization and modeling of complex materials and soft matter.The team measured the mechanical properties of wavy, curly and kinky hairs with a texture analyzer and a dynamic mechanical analyzer. These instruments measure force, stress and other parameters as a strand is first uncurled and then stretched until it breaks.Among other findings, the team recently reported results for the \"stretch ratio,\" a new parameter they developed to quantify and compare the force required to uncurl a strand until it's straight. That ratio was found to be negligible for straight hair (since it can't be uncurled), about 0.8 for wavy, 1.1 for kinky and 1.4 for curly. This measurement could therefore be used as an indicator of the initial curliness of a sample, providing a quantifiable way to distinguish between these types.The team also measured geometric properties, such as the diameter, cross section and 3D shape of strands, using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a camera. In addition, the researchers developed new parameters, including the number of complete waves, curls or coils\u2014known as contours\u2014that they measured on 3-cm lengths of hair. They found that wavy hair has less than one full contour in that length, curly has about two, and kinky/coily has approximately three or more. The results suggest that people will be able to classify their own hair by counting contours, Gaines says.In the latest work, Gaines has begun examining the layer that protects the surface of each hair fiber. Known as the cuticle, it consists of flat cells that overlap each other, like roof shingles. Cuticles have a natural tendency to open and close reversibly when exposed to water, shampoo and conditioner. However, excessive acid and moisture retention can cause permanent damage to the cuticles, causing them to remain irreversibly lifted, thus exposing the inner cortex of the hair fiber. Irreversibly lifted cuticles, and cuticles that easily open and close, make the strand more porous, which causes more moisture absorption. Gaines' preliminary findings show the cuticle layers are larger and spaced further apart in wavy hair than in curly and coily hair. Also, the cuticle edges are smoother in wavy hair. These findings could help the researchers explain why curly and coily locks dry out faster than wavy and straight tresses. Ultimately, Gaines hopes, the team's findings will identify the best parameters for developers to design and for consumers to select the most suitable products for each of the wondrously varied categories of hair.

  "text": "Higher alcohols (C2+ alcohols), which are important raw materials, have been used as the intermediates of valued products. They are also widely applied in various fields of fuel, food, fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and energy.          With the gradual depletion of petroleum resources, the direct synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas has become a sustainable and potential process because of its wide source of raw materials and high atomic utilization. However, the low yield of higher alcohols restricted industrial application.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Sun Jian and Prof. Ge Qingjie from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has realized the direct synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas and achieved the highly selective production of higher alcohols from CO hydrogenation over synergistic iron carbides catalysts.This study was published in Chem Catalysis.\"The proposed synergistic Ca-Fe series catalysts could realize a oxygenate selectivity of 69.7 wt% under mild conditions, alongside the alcohols fraction of 86.4 % in oxygenates,\" said Prof. Sun. \"The total oxygenates and alcohols selectivity outperformed the results of previously reported catalysts.\"With multiple characterizations, the researchers found that the Ca loading enabled the Ca-Fe catalyst to have high surface iron carbides with a proper Fe2C/(Fe5C2+Fe3C) ratio. The Fe5C2 and Fe3C as CO dissociative sites could be assisted by a synergistic effect with Fe2C (CO non-dissociative sites) to produce higher alcohols.Therefore, the proper Fe2C/(Fe5C2+Fe3C) ratio facilitated the balance of the CO dissociative and non-dissociative abilities, and boosted the better cooperation of *CO and *CHx to form the *CHx-*CO species, further promoting the higher alcohols formation.\"This study extends the understanding of the important role of Ca and provides a new strategy for the design of catalysts in CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols,\" said Prof. Sun.

  "text": "Photosynthesis drives all life on Earth. Complex processes are required for the sunlight-powered conversion of carbon dioxide and water to energy-rich sugar and oxygen. These processes are driven by two protein complexes, photosystems I and II. In photosystem I, sunlight is used with an efficiency of almost 100%. Here a complex network of 288 chlorophylls plays the decisive role.          A team led by LMU chemist Regina de Vivie-Riedle has now characterized these chlorophylls with the help of high-precision quantum chemical calculations\u2014an important milestone toward a comprehensive understanding of energy transfer in this system. This discovery may help exploit its efficiency in artificial systems in the future.The chlorophylls in photosystem I capture sunlight in an antenna complex and transfer the energy to a reaction center. There, the solar energy is used to trigger a redox process\u2014that is to say, a chemical process whereby electrons are transferred. The quantum yield of photosystem I is almost 100%, meaning that almost every absorbed photon leads to a redox event in the reaction center.Simulation under natural conditions\"Although the complicated energy transfer inside the photosystem has been studied for decades, there is no consensus up to today about the exact mechanism,\" says de Vivie-Riedle. To gain deeper insights, the researchers simulated the light excitation of all chlorophylls in a model of photosystem I embedded in a lipid membrane. A highly accurate multireference method was used to calculate the electronic excitations. Compared to earlier studies, this approach allows the photosystem I to be described on the basis of state-of-the-art methodology. The complicated calculations were made possible by the supercomputer at the Leibniz Supercomputing Center.The results of the study, which is featured on the cover of the journal Chemical Science, reveal so-called \"red chlorophylls\" that absorb light at slightly lower energies than their neighbors due to ambient electrostatic effects. As a result, their absorption spectrum is red-shifted. Analogously, the researchers also identified energy barriers between the antenna complex and the reaction center, among other places. \"This seems surprising at first glance because there is no obvious gradient along which energy is transferred from the antenna complex to the reaction center,\" explains lead author Sebastian Reiter.Fluctuations overcome energy barriersUnder physiological conditions, however, the entire photosystem I is subject to thermal fluctuations that overcome these energy barriers, as the relative energies of the chlorophylls change with respect to each other. In this way, new pathways into the reaction center can constantly open up, while others close. This, according to the core thesis of the authors, could be the key to the high efficiency of photosystem I.\"Our atomistic simulation of these processes enables a microscopic understanding of the system and its dynamics in its natural environment, complementary to experimental approaches,\" concludes Regina de Vivie-Riedle, who is also a member of the e-conversion cluster of excellence.One of the goals of the cluster is to one day transfer the efficiency of natural photocatalysts to artificial nano-bio hybrid systems for applications such as the production of hydrogen as an energy carrier or the conversion of carbon monoxide into fuel. This requires a better understanding of the energy transfer mechanism. With their results on photosystem I, the scientists have now taken an important step toward the realization of this goal.

  "text": "A team of chemists and computer scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, the University of California and Institut des Sciences et Ingenierie Chimiques, Ecole, have developed an ecosystem of tools to boost machine-learning-based design of metal-organic frameworks.          In their study, reported in the journal ACS Central Science, Kevin Maik Jablonka, Andrew Rosen, Aditi Krishnapriyan and Berend Smit coded tools to convert data into machine learning inputs to create a system to boost machine-learning frameworks.Reticular chemistry is the science of designing and synthesizing porous crystalline materials with certain predefined structures and properties (building blocks). These materials, known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have applications in gas storage, separation, catalysis, sensing and drug delivery.Unfortunately, the discovery and optimization of new MOFs is still largely based on trial-and-error experiments, which is time-consuming and costly. To speed up the development of reticular chemistry, some of the members of the current team created a package of applications called Mofdscribe and released it for use by the general public back in 2022.Since that time, Mofdscribe has been used by many chemists to help them create distinct MOFs. The current team recognized that Mofdscribe had some limitations, however, and set out to create a more useful system.To that end, the researchers created code that allowed for integrating computational modeling, machine learning, data mining and high-throughput screening. They also resolved a problem that involved the data used to train machine-learning algorithms leaking into test sets. One of their goals, they note, was to create dataset analysis tools researchers do not yet need, but likely will at some point. This, they suggest, should help in comparing performance differences between machine learning systems.The result was what the team describes as an \"ecosystem\"\u2014an environment where chemists could go to work out new machine-learning approaches to creating MOFs with desired functions and properties. They note it also allows for identifying novel synthetic routes and reaction conditions.The research team also notes that the new ecosystem will facilitate the sharing and reuse of data and knowledge among researchers in the field of reticular chemistry, which they believe will foster collaboration and innovation.

  "answer_squad": " KERI",
  "text": "A team led by Dr. Ha Yoon-Cheol, a Principal Researcher of Next Generation Battery Research Center at the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI) and Dr. Cheol-Min Park, a Professor of School of Materials Science and Engineering at Kumoh National Institute of Technology (KIT), has developed a low-cost production technology for silicon disulfide (SiS2) for solid-state electrolytes (argyrodite-type) that has potential to accelerate the commercialization of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs).          ASSBs replace the liquid-state electrolytes that transfer ions between the anode and cathode with a solid less prone to fire or explosion. However, there remain many challenges to achieve commercialization, e.g., difficulties in processing and mass production, high material cost, etc. Many research groups across the globe are working hard to tackle these challenges, and KERI has also shown several achievements.In this study, Dr. Ha's team chose silicon disulfide. It is widely known in academia that adding silicon disulfide to solid-state electrolytes for ASSBs helps improve ionic conductivity and moisture stability. However, the synthesis of silicon disulfide from sulfur and silicon requires a high reaction temperature, which leads to surges in the vapor pressure of sulfur, making the silicon disulfide production process particularly tricky. For this reason, silicon disulfide is a very expensive material, which currently costs about KRW 1.7 million per 20 grams.KERI has developed a processing technology for the optimal production of silicon disulfide and paved the way for its application in solid-state electrolytes for ASSBs. The team succeeded in establishing synthesis conditions by optimizing the arrangement of sulfur and silicon powders and creating a perfectly sealed environment to withstand the vapor pressure of sulfur at 800 degrees of reaction temperature. The quality of the resulting product was comparable to the commercially available products. The team made solid-state electrolytes using their silicon disulfide and found that it had more than twice the ionic conductivity and moisture stability. Also, the optimized process will help simplify the production and reduce production costs.\"Many researchers at home and abroad have struggled to address the elevated vapor pressure of sulfur, which required using expensive raw materials or introducing special processes,\" said Dr. Ha. \"What we have achieved will contribute to producing silicon disulfide for solid-state electrolytes cheaper and easier.\"The team also applied the new silicon disulfide as an anode active material for liquid electrolyte-based lithium-ion batteries and identified the destruction and recovery of layered structures during charging and discharging for the first time. The team's findings from their silicon disulfide study were published as the cover article in the recent edition of the Journal of Materials Chemistry A.

  "text": "Quebec is a leader in maple syrup production and its \"liquid gold\" is world-renowned for its quality. To maintain this high standard, the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers association has partnered with scientists at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al to develop a portable test to predict the quality of the syrup based on the harvested sap.          Dubbed the \"COLORI test,\" the method developed by UdeM's chemists and mathematicians has been scientifically validated. The results were published Tuesday, March 21, in the journal ACS Food Science & Technology.\"Thanks to the support of the Consortium for Research and Innovation in Industrial Bioprocesses in Quebec, we were able to develop the COLORI test, patent it and produce the first 250 units,\" said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Masson, an UdeM chemistry professor and lead co-author of the scientific paper. \"All the tests have already been used by the maple syrup producers who participated in our project.\"Fast and simple nanotechnologyThe new COLORI test belongs to the nanotechnology family, and using it is quick and easy. It starts with a small tube containing a solution of gold nanoparticles, to which several drops of sap are added. The amino acids and the amines, which correlate with specific changes in the flavor of maple syrup, bind to the gold nanoparticles, causing them to group together and change the way light interacts with the solution. As a result, the solution changes color from red to blue\u2014a change that can be observed with the naked eye within minutes.The main advantage of this test is that it can be used at the sugar shack, where the results can be immediately interpreted and acted upon. This highly sensitive and therefore highly effective method provides reliable information about the properties of maple sap in real-time to support the production of high-quality maple syrup.\"We encourage partnerships between companies and the public research community to create innovative solutions that meet specific needs and are commercially viable,\" said the Consortium's president and CEO, Mohammed Benyagoub. \"The innovative COLORI project aligns with our mission to strengthen relationships and industry-university collaborative research by helping Quebec's maple syrup industry ensure optimal purity of the syrup it brings to market.\"From detection to predictionThe COLORI test for identifying undesirable compounds in maple products is based on an earlier method developed in Masson's lab in 2018 in collaboration with Simon Forest, then Masson's research officer and now project manager for development and applied research at the producers' association. The first version of the test correlated the intensity of natural aromatic profiles of maple syrup (such as flavor profiles associated with sap and bud characteristics) to the result of the test.\"The COLORI test, which is now in its second version, has become predictive: it works with the maple sap and can determine if the compounds present in the sap harvested by the producer will yield high-quality maple syrup,\" explained Forest, who also holds a master's degree in chemistry from UdeM. \"The test has proved useful as a decision-support tool: for example, to decide whether or not to boil sap that would not produce the desired quality of syrup.\"To move from the first-generation COLORI test to the predictive COLORI test, which provides information on the organoleptic profile of the sap, the two chemists asked QMSP to co-develop the new version of the test using a participatory science approach. This new COLORI test, which requires minimal infrastructure at the sugar shacks, was made possible by the involvement of several maple syrup producers, who participated in three phases of field tests.Masson and Forest also called on the research team of Morgan Craig, an UdeM mathematics professor, to build a mathematical model that predicts the type of maple syrup that will be produced based on the molecular profile of the sap, including its amino acids. \"Their model provides a sense of what the final product will be like, and allows maple syrup producers to better manage production,\" Masson explained.Credit: University of MontrealSoon to be widely availableMaple syrup production is one of the main drivers of Quebec's biofood sector. The maple syrup industry contributed $1 billion to Quebec's gross domestic product in 2022. With 13,300 maple syrup producers and total production of 95 million kilograms in 2022, the province is the world's leading producer of maple syrup, accounting for nearly three quarters of global production.To establish its market value, Quebec maple syrup is rigorously tasted, inspected, checked and classified according to criteria set out in the Convention de mise en march\u00e9 du sirop d'\u00e9rable, a marketing agreement developed by the QMSP. Large-scale deployment of the COLORI test would allow maple syrup producers to evaluate and classify maple sap at little cost before turning it into maple syrup, and would help them manage their production throughout the season.\"Quality is a top priority for Quebec's maple syrup producers,\" said Luc Goulet, president of the producers' association. \"The COLORI test, which will be widely available as of 2024, offers our industry a unique tool to fine-tune our processes and maintain the reputation of Quebec maple syrup.\" More information:Simon Forest et al, Prediction of Maple Syrup Quality from Maple Sap with a Plasmonic Tongue and Ordinal Mixed-Effects Modeling, ACS Food Science & Technology (2023).
